But the Golden Knights, perilously thin in net because of injuries, saw value in his experience, his pedigree, and the fact he was a warm body who could shore up the lone vulnerable spot on a potential championship roster.</p><p>They got what they needed  and more. Although Quick hasnt played in the playoffs, he helped Vegas finish first in the Pacific Division and put them in position to launch their run to the Stanley Cup Final, which they lead two games to one heading into Game 4 on Saturday at FLA Live Arena.</p> Elliott: Resilience and the rats lift Panthers over Golden Knights for first Stanley Cup Final win<p>He's been awesome. He's an unbelievable teammate. He's one of those ultimate competitors. He's been great for our goalies, I think, Vegas defenseman Brayden McNabb, who was Quicks teammate for three seasons with the Kings, said Friday.</p><p>He's a guy who's won and been there. He says the stuff at the right times. It all makes sense. He's been unbelievable for our team and for our room. When he's gone in, he's played well. That was a huge pickup.</p><p>Quick has accepted being the backup to <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/h/hillad01.html">Adin Hill</a>, playing his new role with his old fire. Hill welcomed Quicks support, calling him a good guy to relate to and talk to. Hes been a great addition to our team. Hill also appears to have absorbed some of Quicks feistiness, as evidenced when Hill slashed a crease-crashing <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/t/tkachma01.html">Matthew Tkachuk</a> and put out the not-welcome mat by thrusting his blocker at the heads of Tkachuk and Nick Cousins earlier in the Final. Vintage Quick moves, indeed.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/ef/3c1d693a4f27a1fb53f4cafea74f/stanley-cup-panthers-golden-knights-hockey-18685.jpg"></figure><p>Quick is glad to be a resource for Hill but isnt trying to change Hills game. Hes playing some pretty good hockey in his own right so you try to help him out when the opportunity arises but you dont want to kind of overstep and say too much, Quick said before the Final began. Hes playing the way he is because of the work he put in throughout his career.</p><p>Hill, who was traded by San Jose to Las Vegas last summer for a fourth-round draft pick, got the starting job after Laurent Brossoit suffered a lower-body injury during the Golden Knights second-round series against Edmonton. He has kept it because of his sustained excellence, compiling a 2.12 goals-against average and postseason-best .934 save percentage in 14 games. Even after being beaten Wednesday by the wicked wrister from Carter Verhaeghe </p>four  4<p> minutes and 27 seconds into overtime that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2023-06-08/golden-knights-florida-panthers-stanley-cup-final">gave Florida a 3-2 victory</a>, Hill had stopped 82 of 89 shots in the Final.</p><p>Although Quick isnt making highlight-reel appearances, hes still making a difference for the Golden Knights.</p><p>To me, hes been outstanding every time Ive talked to him. In practice, if hes not the hardest working guy, hes close to it, Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said during interviews at the teams beachside hotel.</p><p>He wants to stay on top of his game in case he does get an opportunity to get in the net. That parts been terrific, just his work ethic, leading by example.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/8f/50/33126b9f43e6a811c3a6005a44d2/golden-knights-stars-hockey-68381.jpg"></figure>But <p>Thats not all. I hear him in the locker room, doing his part, relaying experiences, supporting the team, Cassidy said. So thats the challenge in front of a backup: youve got to be a bit of a cheerleader in that regard and support, sort of a sounding board for the guy whos playing every night. Hes done all those things.</p><p>I cant say enough good things about him. Ill go back to the season when he helped us win games to get us in the position were in, which is win the Pacific Division. He helped us a lot. So, nothing but good from Jonathan, and I dont see that changing.</p><p>The Kings felt they couldnt win with Quick in goal and</p> so<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/hockey/story/2023-03-16/kings-joonas-korpisalo-jonathan-quick-goalies-drew-doughty">acquired Joonas Korpisalo</a> from Columbus. They were dismissed in the first round, and Korpisalo is an unrestricted free agent whose signing price will be difficult for the Kings to squeeze under the salary-cap limit. It was the right decision, but for Quick  also about to become an unrestricted free agent  it must feel like karma that after a shockingly abrupt separation from the only organization hed ever known, hes now two wins from winning the Cup again.</p> Jonathan Quick was the King who transformed Stanley Cup dreams into reality<p>He keeps in touch with his old teammates, he said, but he politely declined to discuss the trade when asked about it before the Final. He wanted to keep the focus on his new team, which is reasonable.</p><p>"Being back and playing hockey in June, its exciting, he said. Everybody in the league, they want to be playing hockey this time of year. Were fortunate enough, us and Florida, so you just try and make the most of it.</p><p>At this point of the year, whatever your role is, you do it and you do it to the best of your ability to help your teammates win.</p><p>He has done that twice before. Now, hes doing it again, in a less visible but still vital way.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Hernndez sustained the injury midway through the first half of Wednesdays U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal in Sandy, Utah.</p><p>The injury is believed to be a Grade 3 tear, meaning the ligament is completely torn and will likely require surgery to repair. Recovery can take six to nine months but Hernndez is 35 and will be out of contract at the end of the season.</p><p>Hernndez led the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2023-05-30/galaxy-president-chris-klein-out">Galaxy</a> in scoring each of the last two seasons and his 35 goals combined </p>was  were<p> second-best in MLS over that span. He missed the first five games this season with a hamstring injury and has just a goal and an assist in nine appearances this season for the Galaxy (3-9-3), who are last in the 29-team league standings.</p> Galaxy star Chicharito works with 'emotional coach' to achieve his goals<p>Mexicos all-time leading scorer with 52 international goals, Hernndez came to the Galaxy ahead of the 2020 season, signing a three-year contract that paid him more than $19.4 million. With the $9.4-million transfer fee the team had to pay Spanish club Sevilla for the rights to sign Hernndez, the deal cost the Galaxy $28.8 million.</p><p>Performance clauses in the designated-player contract were triggered last year, extending the deal for a fourth season and a guaranteed $7.4 million, making Hernndez the third-highest-paid player in the league. If the Galaxy place Hernndez on the season-ending injury list they can sign another designated player, but because of sanctions levied against the team by MLS last December over violations of the leagues salary rules, the Galaxy are limited as to the type of player they can sign to replace him.</p><p>Hernndez, whose father and grandfather </p>both <p>played in World Cups for the Mexican national team, began his career with the youth program at Chivas of Guadalajara when he was 9, then made his first team debut in 2006. After the 2010 World Cup, </p>in  during <p>which he scored twice in four appearances, Hernndez jumped to Manchester United of the English Premier League, the first stop on a five-team, three-country European tour that would see him play for Real Madrid, Bayern Leverkusen, West Ham United and Sevilla, winning two EPL championships, Europe League and Club World Cup titles and start in a Champions League final.</p><p>He also scored in three separate World Cups, making 109 appearances for Mexico. Including the past two seasons with the Galaxy, Hernndez scored 10 or more goals eight times in 18 first-team club seasons.</p> Chicharito wants to take Galaxy back to familiar spot in final year of contract During On <p>the play in which he was injured Wednesday, Hernndez was charging up the center of the Real Salt Lake defense in the</p>  24th 24th <p>minute when he stretched for a pass from teammate Riqui Puig about 15 yards outside the penalty area. Hernndez, who was not touched on the play, then tumbled to the turf and immediately motioned to the Galaxy bench for help as Puig and three RSL players moved in to console him.</p><p>He was carried off the field and to the locker room, his face covered with a towel and shaking his head, as teammates reached out to pat him on the shoulder. He flew back to Los Angeles with the team and underwent an MRI on Thursday, although the team did not announce the results until Friday morning.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

We havent seen the sun in two weeks. Its cloudy and gloomy there.</p><p>Friday was Bafferts first time back at Belmont Park since 2018</p> ,<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-live-belmont-stakes-htmlstory.html">when Justify</a> completed his bid to become the 13th winner of the Triple Crown. It was wild </p>crazy <p>back then, with about 50 members of the media breathlessly awaiting every utterance from the Hall of Fame trainer.</p><p>On Friday morning, there were only three reporters and a television cameraman. Baffert did three separate interviews rather than </p>one  a<p> collective one. He had the time.</p><p>It feels good to be back here, Baffert said. Belmont is nice and its going to be big [Saturday]. Its exciting. The classics are exciting. To be part of it with a horse that has a chance, the excitement is there.</p><p>Clearly the </p> media<p> crowd was missing because </p> athere is no <p>Triple Crown </p> is not<p> on the line. In</p>,<p> fact, no horse has won two legs of the series since Justify. If anyone but Bafferts horse, National Treasure, wins the Belmont Stakes on Saturday, it will be a streak of 16 races with different winners starting with Justify.</p><p>No one is going for a Triple Crown this year, Baffert said. The Triple Crown makes all the difference. Its history being made and its difficult. You learn to appreciate it.</p><p>This years Belmont is probably the best of the Triple Crown races. The Kentucky Derby was overshadowed by a spike in horse fatalities and scratches. The Preakness </p> Stakeswas  did<p> not </p> have<p> an impressive array of horses. Most of the Belmont attention is focused on Forte, who was the Derby favorite before </p> Kentucky <p>state officials <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-06/kentucky-derby-favorite-forte-is-scratched-from-race">scratched the colt</a> on race day because of a bruised hoof. He is the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-06-06/forte-favorite-very-competitive-belmont-stakes">morning line favorite</a> for the Belmont at 5-2 </p> odds  odss<p>. Tapit Trice, who finished seventh in the Derby, is the second pick at 3-1 </p>and  while<p> Angel of Empire, who was third in the Derby, is at 7-2.</p><p>Bafferts top assistant, Jimmy Barnes, has been supervising the training of Preakness winner National Treasure as Baffert didnt arrive in New York until Thursday night after a six-hour flight delay.</p><p>His late arrival also helps partially explain why he has been absent from Belmont Park for so long.</p><p>Usually, we would be at Churchill Downs, Baffert said. When we come from Churchill, we come in on a Wednesday. But being that I wasnt at Churchill, but was coming from California, I came in later. If I was at Churchill, I would be here earlier.</p><p>The reason Baffert </p> wasis <p>not at Churchill is a two-year ban </p> imposed put on him <p>by the track after </p>a race-day medication positive on <p>Medina Spirit </p> tested positive for a medication banned on race day<p> after he won the Kentucky Derby in 2021. After it was clear that Medina Spirit was not going to run in the Belmont, the New York Racing Assn. banned Baffert for two years, later reduced to one, even though he </p>has <p>never had </p> a horse fail a drug testmedication positive <p>in the state.</p><p>Were still dealing with that right now, Baffert said of the ongoing litigation. Were still in the process of wondering why they did that. Were at the bridge right now and havent crossed it yet. I just want to clear my name.</p><p>Last year during the Triple Crown series, Baffert was serving a 90-day suspension from Kentucky, and honored by all states, for the Medina Spirit violation.</p><p>Bafferts Churchill ban is set to expire </p>on <p>July 3. For the last two years, Bafferts Derby horses were transferred to Tim Yakteen, his former assistant. National Treasure was moved to Yakteen this year to run in the Santa Anita Derby, but his fourth-place finish wasnt good enough to get him into the Derby field. After the race, the colt was transferred back to Baffert.</p><p>Just getting to the Derby is tough, Baffert said. Then, if a horse doesnt run well in the Derby, they say hes just tired. And the people are tired</p>,<p> too. Its still going to be an exciting race, the Belmont is very important to the fans in New York. Its tradition.</p><p>All the good horses used to run in all the big races. Now the trainer wants to pick their spots, give their horse a month off.  Look, there are only nine horses [in Saturdays race]. Weve had three weeks and there are still only nine horses.  Its the classics and the Breeders Cup that keeps this sport going.</p>So, <p>As the </p> 2023<p> Triple Crown series comes to a close </p>on <p>Saturday, the sport hopes to come out of the shadow of controversies and point itself to the Breeders Cup at Santa Anita in November.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

McLaughlin-Levrone, the New Jersey native who has trained primarily in Los Angeles under <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2023-05-26/bobby-kersee-track-sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-olympics">coach Bobby Kersee</a> for two years, ran the 400 meters in 49.17 seconds.</p> DuringAmid <p>the Paris</p> ian<p> stop of the Diamond League, the sports highest-profile circuit, that saw the fastest times ever run by Faith Kipyegon in the womens 1,500 meters, Lamecha Girma in the mens 3,000-meter steeplechase and Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the mens two-mile, McLaughlins second-place finish was no less intriguing. It was a preview of what could be the second chapter of a career that already claims two Olympic gold medals and three world championships.</p><p>I was very pleased, </p>Bobby <p>Kersee</p>, McLaughlin-Levrones coach,<p> said in a phone interview with The Times after the race. She did exactly what I asked her to do and the things that went wrong, I know what I could do to correct it and get her ready for our national championships."</p><p>By virtue of her world championships title last summer, McLaughlin-Levrone owns an automatic berth in the 400 hurdles for the next world championships, </p>held in  set for<p> August in Hungary. Kersee said he will know her recovery early next week </p> and<p> whether McLaughlin-Levrone will compete again before the U.S. championships</p>, held on<p> July 6-9. </p>But <p>With her automatic bid in their back pocket, Kersees focus has been on trying McLaughlin-Levrone this summer in the </p>open <p>400 </p> meters<p> and opened the possibility for competing in both. Whether she runs both or not at the world championships is something shes still deciding, McLaughlin-Levrone told reporters in Paris on Wednesday.</p><p>That build-up, and the dearth of chances to see her race, is why Friday </p>into  became<p> a highly anticipated debut.&nbsp;</p><p>Running sub-50 the first time out, [personal record], and going out as hard as she did for me, Im pleased, Kersee said.</p><p>Only 10 women have run a 400 faster than McLaughlin-Levrones season-opener Friday since 2021, a span that includes an Olympics and world championships, leaving her among a select class of athletes whose times could theoretically reach the final of a world championship. She sprinted hard through the races first half but was eventually caught by Marileidy Paulino, the Olympic and world championships silver medalist.</p><p>Watching the race at his home, Edwin Moses, the famed 400-meter hurdler who won 122 consecutive races between 1977 and 1987, said it reminded him exactly of an open 400 meters he raced in Belgium in 1977 in which he started fast but faded.</p><p>It was a lesson, he said, of the stark differences between the events that share a distance but biomechanically are completely different animals, he said. The hurdles rewards speed but also precision  the number of steps between hurdles, the right technique to clear a hurdle and land. The open 400 hinges on turning the feet over as fast as possible and maintaining it. It can lead to a different level of fatigue, Moses said.</p><p>It's great training for the 400 hurdles because the kind of fatigue that I know she experienced, she's going to experience that between the ninth and the 10th hurdles so that's the upside of it, that she ran a race in which she will feel like she's going to feel in the 400 hurdles, Moses said. If she continues to do 400 hurdles that might be a big plus for her.&nbsp;</p><p>Fridays season-opening race for McLaughlin-Levrone showed reasons for optimism of her potential in the open 400, the grip that existing 400-meter specialists still hold on the event and the technical gap she must overcome for a</p>ny future<p> record attempt.</p><p>I just got through talking to her and she feels the difference in terms of the technique with the 400 versus the 400 hurdles," Kersee said. "And it gives her something to wrap her mind around now in practice, to understand the technical differences in what you've got to do in the latter half of the race in the open 400 versus the 400 hurdles.</p>Those <p>Some within the sport and Kersees training group believe Marita Kochs 1985 world record of 47.60 seconds, which no athlete has come within a half-second of breaking</p> since<p>, could one day be within reach  an optimism that partly springs from her 47.91-second leg on the U.S. gold-medal 4x400-meter relay at Julys world championships, which was historys seventh-fastest womans relay split, according to statistician Mark Butler.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, McLaughlin-Levrone said that her first thought after setting the new 400 hurdles world record last summer of 50.68 seconds was intense pain. One of her next emotions was relief. She had felt the intense </p>outside <p>scrutiny and expectations that followed her into last years championships after setting the world record only weeks earlier.</p><p>Getting over the mental hurdle of getting through that race, that was like the victory, she said.</p><p>Her race Friday showed why no shortage of hype will </p>again <p>follow her into Augusts world championships. McLaughlin-Levrone said she ultimately wants to define herself against her own expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, people are looking at the 400 record, maybe moving to the shorter, moving to the 200, so on and so forth, McLaughlin-Levrone said in May. But honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I just want to run and see how fast I can run every single day. Whether I break records or don't break records, or win this or win that, like everyday, to me, it's a mental hurdle of I don't always want to do this, but I'm going to do this and being able to push myself to do things that I didn't think I was capable of.</p><p>And that sounds like a very generic answer, but it's the honest truth. I think when you place too many expectations on yourself, you put yourself in a position to be, I don't know, defined by them if you don't reach them. And I don't want to do that.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

First, his hand began to cramp. Then his legs. And so, at 1-all, Alcaraz needed to take a break and get treated by a trainer. Because it was not a changeover, Alcaraz was required to forfeit the following game and fell behind 2-1.</p><p>From there, it was pretty much all over. Djokovic, who is 36, was able to cruise to the finish against Alcaraz, who is 20, making for the widest age gap in a mens Grand Slam semifinal since 1991.</p><p>Score one for the old guys.</p><p>It was the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-open-tennis-championships-novak-djokovic-sports-alexander-zverev-maria-sakkari-22a35b810aa6a85c0951233afcd77463">45th Grand Slam semifinal for Djokovic</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-us-open-tennis-championships-sports-new-york-8f48fa319ce13cb110db3ad2436ab0a7">the second for Alcaraz</a>.</p><p>I feel for him. I feel sorry. ... I hope he can recover very soon, Djokovic said. I told him at the net he knows how young he is. He has plenty of time ahead of him. Hes going to win this tournament, Im sure, many, many times. Hes an unbelievable player.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>Instead, it is No. 3 Djokovic who will meet <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alcaraz-djokovic-zverev-ruud-french-open-6249e474dcc7f1659811395b80d46440">No. 4 Casper Ruud of Norway or No. 22 Alexander Zverev of Germany</a> in Sundays final.</p><p>Ruud  a two-time major runner-up last year, including in Paris  and Zverev  the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open  were scheduled to play the second semifinal later Friday. Neither owns a major trophy.</p><p>Djokovic is hoping to leave Roland Garros this year with his third French Open title and his 23rd Slam championship overall, which would break a tie with <a href="https://apnews.com/article/french-open-nadal-djokovic-alcaraz-0da6a8a9a90aa26472708f310c112866">rival Rafael Nadal</a> for the most by a man in the history of tennis.</p><p>Nadal was absent from his favorite tournament this year because of a hip injury.</p><p>That left most people focusing on two men over the past two weeks: Djokovic, who has won 10 of the past 19 majors, and Alcaraz, who won the U.S. Open in September. Djokovic is one of the dominant figures in the sport's history; Alcaraz is considered its future.</p><p>And they sure put on a show for two sets.</p><p>I think we were both at the physical limit, to be honest, toward the end of the second set, said Djokovic, who had his right forearm massaged by a trainer during that set. I wasnt feeling fresh at all. We went toe-to-toe."</p><p>Djokovic was at his stretching, sliding best, whipping groundstrokes that pushed Alcaraz all over the place.</p><p>Alcaraz, somehow, chased just about everything down, his speed and instinct as good as there is.</p><p>Nothing was as spectacular as <a href="https://twitter.com/rolandgarros/status/1667173600497922049">THAT shot by Alcaraz</a>. The shot of the day, of the tournament, of the year.</p><p>It arrived at 1-all in the second set. Having lured Alcaraz forward, Djokovic sent the ball toward the baseline. Many a player would have given up on the point and chosen to move onto the next. Or perhaps attempted to get there but failed. Alcaraz gave chase, running with his back to the net, then sliding beyond the baseline, his left foot bending as he came to a halt and spun his body around and out of the way, leaning backward in order to lace a forehand past Djokovic for a winner.</p><p>As the crowd roared and rose for an ovation to celebrate the feat, Alcaraz raised his left hand and briefly jutted his index finger into the No. 1 gesture.</p><p>He smiled a wide smile.</p><p>Even Djokovic had to smile, and used his racket to applaud.</p><p>Everything changed in the third set, though.</p><p>Right before missing a forehand return to make it 1-all, Alcaraz flexed his hand. It was clearly bothering him. After that forehand, he hopped on his left leg, then clutched his right calf. He dropped his racket on the ground. Chair umpire Aurlie Tourte went over to check on him. So did Djokovic, walking all the way to Alcarazs side of the court.</p><p>A medical timeout for an injury  what the rulebook calls an acute medical condition  during a match is allowed. But treatment for cramps when it isnt time for a changeover is not permitted without penalty. So Tourte told Alcaraz that he could sit on the sideline and get help from a trainer, but he would need to concede the following game, which he did.</p><p>When the scoreboard was updated without a point being played, reflecting that Djokovic now led 2-1 in that set, the crowd jeered and whistled and booed, until Tourte explained in French what was happening.</p><p>From that moment onwards, Djokovic said, it was a different match.</p><p>Alcaraz would only claim one more game. It is Djokovic who gets to keep playing.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

UCLAs first Big Ten schedule will include Ohio State, Northwestern, Nebraska, Minnesota and USC at the Rose Bowl in addition to road games against Michigan, Indiana, Iowa and Rutgers.</p> Naps, yoga and chargers. What UCLA and USC can learn from Hawaii's travel experiences<p>The football program is very much focused on the 2023 season and making it a great one, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2021-06-27/martin-jarmond-ucla-year-1">UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond</a> said. That said, its exciting to see the future conference matchups fans will get to experience at the Rose Bowl.</p><p>USCs 2024 conference schedule includes Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois at the Coliseum plus road games against Penn State, Purdue, Maryland, Northwestern and UCLA.</p><p>The Trojans and Bruins have another common opponent  LSU  in 2024. Though </p>While<p> UCLA will travel to Baton Rouge to face the Tigers, USC will play them in a neutral-site game at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.</p><p>Its a good thing the College Football Playoff will expand to 12 teams starting with the 2024 season because even top Big Ten teams are likely to lose at least a handful of games given these demanding schedules. The upside is that the strength-of-schedule factor could conceivably help the conference land three or more teams in the CFP.</p><p>As expected, the Trojans and Bruins will log plenty of frequent flier miles. Excluding its trip to the Rose Bowl, USCs four other conference road games in 2024 will require trips of more than 2,000 miles. UCLAs closest road conference game that season will be in Iowa City, Iowa, some 1,796 miles from Los Angeles. The Bruins will also </p>have to <p>schlep roughly 2,751 miles to face Rutgers </p> after having flown to Hawaii for a nonconference game. They might want to budget for a jet lag specialist.<p>No Big Ten team will have to make two trips to Los Angeles in a season as part of the schedules released for the 2024 and 2025 seasons.</p><p>The idea of the scheduling model was to preserve matchups important to Big Ten fans, conference commissioner Tony Petitti said during an interview on the Big Ten Network. With the additions of the L.A. schools, Petitti said, he wanted teams to rotate through more opponents with increased frequency; each Big Ten team is guaranteed to play one another at least once every two years.</p> Holiday Bowl sues Pac-12 and UC regents over UCLA's 2021 withdrawal from game<p>The Big Tens divisions will be eliminated starting in 2024 and teams will have up to three protected rivals they play each season, though Penn State will have none. Not surprisingly, USC and UCLA will be each others only protected rivals.</p><p>As part of a so-called flex protect-plus scheduling model, teams will play three opponents home and away in 2024 and 2025. In addition to UCLA, USC will play Penn State and Wisconsin each of those seasons, </p> andwhile <p>the Bruins play Nebraska and Rutgers.</p><p>The Trojans dont catch any breaks as part of their 2025 conference schedule given they play Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan State. UCLA will play Penn State, Wisconsin and Michigan State as part of its 2025 Big Ten schedule. Also on the Bruins schedule in 2025: a home game against two-time defending national champion Georgia.</p><p>By then, big-time success will require UCLA and USC to knock off a parade of heavyweights as part of their new conference alignment.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

His </p>D d<p>ad kind of giggled, but you could just tell. The physical tools, the intangibles, the decision-making skills were there. He was the complete package.</p><p>Nine years later, DeLuca, now 6</p>-<p>feet </p>tall <p>and 205 pounds, with sandy blond locks, a mustache and a hoop earring  more on that later  reached Dodger Stadium on Sunday, and hes expected to make his major league debut against <a href="https://www.mlb.com/reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> left-hander <a href="https://www.mlb.com/player/brandon-williamson-682227">Brandon Williamson</a> in Great American Ball Park on Wednesday night.</p><p>But there was no guarantee DeLuca would </p>ever <p>arrive at this destination, and very little expectation among those who followed his career through college that he could.</p><p>I cant tell you how many scouts looked at him and said, Oh, hes not very projectable, hes only 5-11, hes reached his limit,  Chevrier said. I thought he was going to be special. He packs a big punch offensively, defensively and on the basepaths.</p><p>A standout sprinter and long jumper and speedy leadoff man for most of his high school career, DeLuca was a 39th-round pick of the Minnesota Twins in 2017. He opted to play college ball at Oregon, where the switch-hitter batted a combined .226 with a .650 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, 11 homers and 72 RBIs in 2018 and 2019.</p> Recap: Bullpen falters again as Dodgers blow five-run lead and lose to Reds, 9-8<p>The Dodgers liked DeLucas athleticism enough to draft him in the 25th round and sign him for $300,000 in 2019, but it would be three years before DeLuca cracked an MLB Pipeline or Baseball America list of the organizations top 30 prospects.</p><p>DeLuca scrapped switch-hitting after he was drafted to focus on his right-handed swing. He hit .273 with a .726 OPS and one homer in 26 Arizona rookie </p>-<p>league games in 2019.</p><p>The 2020 minor league season was wiped out by C</p> OVIDovid<p>-19, but DeLuca used the time to work extensively with private hitting coaches Craig Wallenbrock and Doug Latta, who helped DeLuca tap into his tremendous lower-body strength and develop a more functional, efficient, powerful and repeatable swing.</p><p>DeLuca hit .264 with an .867 OPS, 22 homers and 64 RBIs in 101 games for Class-A Rancho Cucamonga and Great Lakes in 2021 and .260 with an .888 OPS, 25 homers and 71 RBIs in 98 games for Great Lakes and double-A Tulsa in 2022, earning a 40-man roster spot  and protection from the Rule 5 draft  last winter.</p><p>A lot of people talk about [bat] path and upper body and where your hands are, which is all really important stuff, DeLuca, 24, said. But the lower body, once I locked in on that, I was able to unlock a lot of the power. Being grounded, being in a consistent spot where I land, thats the foundation of the swing.</p><p>DeLuca hit .292 with a .95</p> 32<p> OPS, 14 homers and 37 RBIs in 49 games for Tulsa and triple-A Oklahoma City this season with improved plate discipline  he had 38 strikeouts and 21 walks in 195 at-bats. But when he was called into triple-A manager Travis Barbarys office </p>on <p>Saturday, he thought it was to inform him hed take Sunday off.</p> "I thought he was going to be special. He packs a big punch offensively, defensively and on the basepaths.<p>He did eventually get Sunday off  in Los Angeles. DeLuca was called up to replace reserve outfielder <a href="https://www.mlb.com/player/trayce-thompson-572204">Trayce Thompson</a>, who suffered a left </p>-<p>oblique strain and will be out </p>for <p>at least a month. </p> DeLuca He <p>caught an early flight to LAX and was on the bench for the series finale against the New York Yankees.</p><p>It really caught me by surprise, said DeLuca, who grew up a Dodgers fan and listed <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-06-02/dodgers-yankees-clayton-kershaw-mookie-betts-recap">Clayton Kershaw</a>  the first teammate he spoke to </p>on <p>Sunday and Manny Ramirez as his favorite players. Everyone here says it happens super quick, but you dont really believe it until its actually here. Its pretty surreal, a really cool experience.</p><p>Despite Chevriers 2014 prediction, DeLuca, an avid surfer and mountain-bike rider in high school, didnt develop into a big </p>-<p>league prospect until college, where he lifted weights seriously for the first time and added 30 pounds to his compact, sturdy frame while maintaining his speed and agility.</p><p>The surplus strength, melded with his mastery of biomechanics and increased exposure to professional pitching, put DeLuca on a faster track to the major leagues.</p><p>The swing is an art to me, just understanding how my body is moving, DeLuca said. Theres so many different intricacies in it. So learning that, how pitchers are throwing, my body  thats a really fun part of the game for me, breaking down mechanics and so many different levels of the game.</p> "Hes probably one of the strongest guys in the organization as far as the lower half.<p>DeLuca will likely play left field or center field against left-handed pitchers, and his speed  he was successful on 58 of 63 stolen-base attempts in 274 minor league games  could be useful off the bench.</p><p>Hes a baseball player, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. Hes that old-school, gritty, grinder type. Hes a really good defender at all three [outfield spots] and can really run. Hes probably one of the strongest guys in the organization as far as the lower half.</p><p>DeLucas upper half has game, too, as Roberts noted when he ribbed DeLuca about the hoop in his left ear </p>on <p>Sunday.</p><p>I had a [stud earring] a long time ago, back in 1990  Im sure there are pictures, but I wont be revisiting that, said Roberts, the former outfielder. So when I saw the hoop, I had to call him out and make a joke about it. Theres a good story about why he got it.</p> How Dodgers' James Outman, Miguel Vargas have navigated growing pains of rookie season<p>Indeed, there is. DeLuca was struggling at Great Lakes last season, hitting .199 with a .710 OPS on June 15, when he told hitting coach Dylan Nasiatka that if he</p>  weren'twasnt<p> named Midwest League player of the week the following week, he would get an earring.</p><p>I had to change something, I had to do something, DeLuca said. I heated up a little that week, hitting two home runs, but I didnt get player of the week. So I stuck to my word, went to Claires in Midland, Mich., on a Monday and got the earring.</p><p>Silly superstition? Hardly. DeLuca went on a tear, batting .455 (20 for 44) with three homers, 10 doubles, 16 RBIs and 12 runs in his next 12 games.</p><p>I was player of the week for two straight weeks, I got promoted to Tulsa [on July 4] and added to the 40-man roster in the offseason, DeLuca said. So it stuck.</p>Tiimes staff writer Jack Harris contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He was told one of the teams was from Commerce, Mickey Mantles hometown. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers">Dodgers</a> top prospect nodded. He continued eating. The factoid didnt quite resonate.</p><p>Cartaya comes from a place far from this stop in Oklahoma, where tornadoes loom every spring and the Dodgers double-A affiliate serves as a downtown entertainment hub. Maracay is a Venezuelan city near the countrys Caribbean coast with a population of nearly </p>one  1<p> million. It is home to several prominent baseball players. Future Hall of Famer Miguel Cabrera is its most famous export. Cartaya aspires to join the list.</p><p>My goal is to be healthy and continue learning, Cartaya said in Spanish. Let them or God decide when it's my opportunity to get there  whether it's this year or next year or in two years or tomorrow.</p><p>The 21-year-old catcher entered the season as a consensus top-15 prospect across the minors. He was an offensive dynamo touted for his makeup and work ethic since the Dodgers signed him for $2.5 million in 2018, quickly learning English while winning over decision-makers within the organization. The combination, especially for a catcher, has produced intoxicating projections.</p><p>We've had some really good players and good human beings come through here and he's one of the best, double-A Tulsa manager Scott Hennessey said. Just a great human being.</p> Clayton Kershaw dominates as Dodgers defeat Reds to snap losing streak<p>As with nearly every prospect at this stage of development, though, questions about Cartayas professional baseball future linger. Will he hold up defensively as a catcher? Will he continue hitting as he rises the ranks? Is his injury history a bad omen? Not every talent evaluator is sold on future stardom.</p><p>Back and hamstring injuries hindered Cartaya in 2021. Last season, as a result, the Dodgers wanted to limit him to four games per week while he played in single A. The Dodgers eventually budged in letting him play five games per week even though one or two were as the DH.</p><p>This season, Cartaya has played in 37 of Tulsas 53 games. Hes started 28 games as the catcher and nine as the designated hitter</p>through games of June 7; update<p>.<b> </b>Hes stayed healthy, but his offensive production hasnt translated to the higher level.</p><p>Cartaya is batting .210 with seven home runs and a .712 on-base-plus-slugging percentage for Tulsa</p>through games of June 7; update<p>.<b> </b>A recent hot stretch  hes batting .333 with a 1.056 OPS, four home runs and hits in seven of his last eight games  has bolstered the overall numbers going into the seasons third month.</p>through games of June 7 (he did not play on June 7); update<p>I'm really not that worried, Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said when asked about Cartayas back injury history. I've been around a lot of players that have had it and the maintenance part of it, and working out in smarter ways, I haven't seen recurrences of it with most position players I've been around. I'm really not worried about it. I'm really not.  His makeup is in my Mount Rushmore of young players I've been around.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/f8/ef/ff2613b0436f9b692a7523a11511/dodgers-angels-baseball-30867.jpg"></figure><p>The first question when Cartaya reported to big</p>-<p> league camp for the first time in February was seemingly when, not if, hell reach the majors. The next question was whether </p>or not <p>that would come with the Dodgers. Cartaya is a valuable asset the Dodgers could use as a cornerstone in Los Angeles. He also could be a trade chip to sooner upgrade the big</p>-<p> league roster for a playoff push this season.</p><p>The Dodgers already have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-04-05/will-smith-dodgers-superstar-player-mlb">Will Smith</a>, one of the top catchers in the majors, behind the plate. Smith is just 28 years old and isnt slated to become a free agent until after the 2025 season. The Dodgers trove of high-end catching talent doesnt end there.</p><p>Dalton Rushing, the organizations 2022 second-round pick, is rising on prospect lists. In 42 games for single-A Great Lakes, Rushing is batting .261 with seven home runs and a .938 OPS  an output comparable to Cartayas 62-game stint with the affiliate last year.</p>stats through June 7; update<p>Then theres Thayron Liranzo, a 19-year-old switch-hitting catcher the Dodgers signed in 2021 out of the Dominican Republic for $30,000.</p><p>Liranzo, whose tool kit includes an explosive arm, is hitting .253 with 14 home runs and a .929 OPS in 44 games for single-A Rancho Cucamonga in his first full-season test.</p>stats through June 7; update<p><b> </b>One rival talent evaluator said he believes Liranzo will have a better big</p>-<p> league career than Cartaya or Keibert Ruiz, the top prospect the Dodgers included in the trade package for Max Scherzer and Trea Turner in 2021.</p><p>Liranzos emergence is a testament to the Dodgers renowned ability to develop minor leaguers; Liranzo isnt even ranked among the organizations top 30 prospects on either MLB.com or Baseball Americas lists.</p><p>With a farm system as deep as the Dodgers cache, speculation will undoubtedly bubble before the Aug. 1 trade deadline. The Dodgers are in a battle for first place in the National League West with Arizona but could be in the market for help in the middle infield, outfield, bullpen, and starting rotation for their playoff push. Cartaya will be someone other clubs inquire about. His name will surface in rumors  as they did last summer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2022-07-17/dodgers-should-trade-prospect-diego-cartaya-to-acquire-juan-soto">when superstar Juan Soto was available</a>.</p><p>At this moment, the Dodgers name is on my chest and that's the team that I'm going to represent and play with everything, Cartaya said. And when the moment comes that God decides  be it with another team or this team  I'd be grateful and give it 100%. There are always going to be rumors.</p> Hernndez: Dodgers should trade prospect Diego Cartaya if it lands them Juan Soto<p>Cartaya said he was a third baseman until he converted to catcher when he was 14 years old to become more attractive to scouts. He signed as a catcher two years later and hasnt played any other position in the field in a minor</p>-<p> league game. Friedman, however, said Cartaya played some infield during the Dodgers summer camp in 2020.</p><p>Have the Dodgers considered moving Cartaya to another position with Smith seemingly blocking the path to being the everyday catcher for the Dodgers?</p><p>Not right now, Friedman said. Having catching depth is a really good thing to have with the scarcity at that position. Hes played infield. The hands work, but, for us, it's something that we're continuing to develop there behind the plate. And then when he's ready, we'll assess where we're at and what makes sense.</p><p>In April, before the Drillers series opener against the Wichita Wind Surge, Cartaya attended the customary pre-series pitchers meeting where coaches, pitchers, and catchers discussed how to attack Wichitas hitters over the next five games.</p><p>The strategy session went longer than usual. He was the teams designated hitter that night  a scheduled game off from the catching grind  but would return behind the plate the next night to catch a staff that ranks first in the Southern League in earned-run average (3.00) by more than a run through Tuesday.</p>stats through June 6; update<p>Last year, I won't say I didn't pay a lot of attention because I was trying to learn, but it was a little easier because of the lineups, Cartaya said. Here, at this level, you'll encounter much more experience and better hitters in the lineup so you have to dedicate more time to that. It's one of the things that I've tried to focus on. Improve my game-calling, work with the resources we have. And I know that's important in the higher levels.</p> Dodgers minor league camp: Diego Cartaya, Bobby Miller, other top prospects shine<p>Cartaya went on to double in his first plate appearance that night. He struck out in each of his final three. As scheduled, he started at catcher the next day. He ended the game with a walk-off sacrifice fly. It was one of his few offensive highlights in April, which included just two multi-hit games and one home run in 14 games.</p><p>Friedman contended Cartayas early struggles stemmed from pressing. He said Cartaya created bad habits and his mechanics got out of whack. The recent results are cause for optimism that hes turned the corner in a league where hes more than three years younger than the average age.</p><p>Cartaya doesnt turn 22 until September. Plenty, in and out of his control, can happen before then. For now, hes a double-A catcher with a bright future  wherever it is.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Everybody is under one big umbrella. The wedge is gone.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-06-15/commentary-saudi-backed-liv-golf-repugnant-but-bottomless-billions-terrify-pga-tour">PGA Tour and LIV Golf</a> have beaten their raised four-irons into </p> plowshares ploughshares<p>, dropped their lawsuits and are happily moving forward arm in arm.</p><p>&nbsp;After two years of disruption and distraction, this is a historic day for the game we all know and love, said PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan, revealing the stunning news Tuesday that the battling leagues  </p>including <p>as well as the DP World Tour (also known as the European Tour)  are merging to form a yet-unnamed, for-profit entity </p> with funding from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. <p>But what about the days to come? Weve seen the celebration. Now comes the fallout.</p><p>This hasnt just been disruption and distraction. The Saudi-backed LIV Golf </p> Invitational<p> Series was painted, maybe rightly so, as a cataclysmic threat to the game. It pitted player against player  the loyalists who stood by the PGA Tour, sometimes turning down the guarantee of generational wealth, and the players many viewed as traitorous for switching sides to accept money that was dirty </p> due to because of Saudi Arabia's history of human rights violations. https://twitter.com/PhilMickelson/status/1666084757816610819<p>And now all is forgotten?</p><p>Consider the case of rising star Will Zalatoris. He reportedly turned down $130 million from LIV earlier this year. He was runner-up at the 2021 Masters, lost in a playoff at the 2022 PGA Championship, and nearly forced a playoff at last years U.S. Open.</p><p>Zalatoris pulled out of the Masters in April just before his first-round tee time because of a back injury, and he later announced he had undergone surgery and is done for the year. Lots of players have returned from significant injuries to great success, so thats a well-traveled path. But that safety net of money would be nice right now, especially if that morality stigma has seemingly evaporated.</p><p>While Phil Mickelson, the face of LIV, is gleeful about the merger  Awesome day today, he tweeted with a smiley-face emoji  players who stuck with the PGA Tour sounded almost blindsided.</p><p>I love finding out morning news on Twitter, tweeted Collin Morikawa, who could have commanded a fortune had he jumped to LIV.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael Kim, who likewise made the jump from Cal to the PGA Tour, was more direct: Very curious how many people knew this deal was happening. About 5-7 people? Player run organization right? </p> he tweeted, <p>followed by a shrugging emoji.</p> Commentary: Saudi-backed LIV Golf might be repugnant, but its bottomless billions terrify PGA Tour <p>This isnt just a peace treaty, its a merger among warring factions. Who could have imagined this two weeks ago during the awkward trophy presentation at the PGA Championship, when Seth Waugh, chief executive of the PGA of America, looked as if</p> hed<p> he would rather be anywhere than standing beside LIVs Brooks Koepka for an obligatory photo op?</p><p>The two didnt shake hands, and Waugh said something to Koepka as he walked away, leaving the golfer to smile and shake his head as if to say, Whats up with that guy?</p><p>Brandel Chamblee, analyst for </p> the <p>Golf Channel </p> who,<p> has been one of LIVs most outspoken critics, tweeted a week ago that LIV wasnt so much a sports entity as </p> it was<p> Saudi Arabia and its crown prince trying to hide their atrocities and launder its reputation by buying sports stars. Any yielding to or agreement with them is a deal with a murderous dictator.</p><p>After news of the merger, Koepka tweeted: Welfare Check on Chamblee.</p><p>This isnt over. This isnt unity. The fallout is only beginning.</p> British Open players sound off on Greg Norman and LIV Golf<p>This is a victory for LIV Golf. The PGA Tour caved, and the landscape has already changed. Acrimony aside, those changes benefit the players in the form of more autonomy and significantly bigger purses.</p><p>On another note, its a bummer for Los Angeles Country Club, which next week plays host to the U.S. Open for the first time. The major championship hasnt taken place in L.A. for 75 years.</p><p>Now, instead of inquiries about their impressions of the spectacular North Course, players will be peppered with questions about the merger.</p><p>Everybodys under the same umbrella now. But the storm is only just rolling in.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Have three races in five weeks for horse racing's Triple Crown made it obsolete?</title>
      <link>https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-06-07/horse-racing-triple-crown-obsolete-three-races-in-five-weeks</link>
      <description>No horse will run all legs of the Triple Crown this year, making some wonder if the three-race, five-week format should be changed. Many like it as is.</description>

The last horse to run all the legs was War of Will in 2019.</p><p>Ideas have been floated to run the Kentucky Derby in May, the Preakness </p> Stakes<p> in June and the Belmont Stakes in July, or some other formula that allows more time between races. </p>But <p>Many of those in </p> the<p> racing </p> industry<p>, when faced with the idea of change, would just as soon wrap their arms around Tevye in his horse-drawn wagon and belt out a rousing version of Tradition.</p>But <p>Yet faced with a year like this, </p>with a  when the<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-06/kentucky-derby-coverage">Kentucky Derby</a> that came up two horses short of a full field and the best one on the sideline, a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-20/bob-baffert-emotional-day-national-treasure-wins-2023-preakness-stakes-recap">Preakness Stakes</a> that could generously be called mediocre, and Saturdays nine-horse <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-06-06/forte-favorite-very-competitive-belmont-stakes">Belmont Stakes</a> considered the best field of them all, its legitimate to ask if the current Triple Crown format is obsolete.</p><p>I dont think its ever good to stick your head in the sand and say never, said Kate Tweedy, who as the daughter of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-04-30/50th-anniversary-of-secretariat-victory">Secretariat</a> owner Penny Chenery Tweedy, is Triple Crown royalty. Its important for the sport to improve itself. Im in favor of changes that moves us in that direction.</p><p>Horses are much more lightly raced. They used to be much tougher, heavily raced. Horses cant stand that grueling of a test [of three races in five weeks]. Im in favor of moving them further down the calendar.</p><p>Tweedy does have one caveat.</p><p>You would have to put a full stop at the end of all the previous records and start a new set of records, Tweedy said. I dont like to mess with history, but you have to change with the times.</p><p>This year is the 50th anniversary of Secretariat <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-04-30/50th-anniversary-of-secretariat-victory">winning the Triple Crown</a>, all with record times that remain in place</p> today<p>.</p><p>The race with the most to gain is the Preakness Stakes, which comes two weeks after the Kentucky Derby. Most horses, after a rough trip in the Derby, prefer to wait the five weeks and come back in the Belmont Stakes.</p><p>This year the television contract is not exclusively held by NBC, with the Belmont moving to FOX. That lessens the power one network has over the scheduling. </p>So, <p>Could the Preakness </p>just <p>unilaterally move the </p> race Preakness <p>back one more week?</p><p>I guess we could, said Aiden Butler, chief executive of 1st/Racing, which runs the Preakness. We could say, dont worry about [the Belmont]. But we have a really good relationship with both Churchill and NYRA [New York Racing Assn.]. It hasnt always been the case.</p><p>The Triple Crown Inc. is a thing we own between the three of us. So, you would want to be thoughtful and mindful. Sometimes its a little unfair on NYRA because its not that crazy an event unless there is a Triple Crown in play. It means most of the time they have to carry the burden of that third leg. But when they get the possibility of a Triple Crown winner it boosts the whole ecosystem of the Triple Crown.</p>OK, so <p>Is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2021-06-16/santa-anita-is-not-for-sale-tsg-executive-says-horse-racing">The Stronach Group</a>, of which 1st/Racing is a part, in favor</p>  of change or not<p>?</p><p>Our company is straight down the middle, Butler said. A lot of them want to do it, a lot of them dont.</p> Though While <p>trainers hold enormous sway in when and where a horse runs, its ultimately the owners decision. And again, its the T word that comes up.</p><p>Its a sport built on tradition, said Gary Fenton, managing partner at Little Red Feather Racing. I would keep it. You aim for the Derby and if you dont get into the field, you have another big race right behind it. If I were a race track, I could see where they might want to change it. But as an owner, keep it the same.</p><p>Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert has won two Triple Crowns and 17 Triple Crown races, so its no surprise he likes things </p>just <p>the way they are.</p><p>Weve thought about that but its very important [to make it difficult] because thats what makes the Triple Crown, Baffert said in Baltimore the day before winning the Preakness with National Treasure. A lot of people dont run their horses back [in the Preakness]. You have to remember, we run them a lot just to get them into the Derby. I think [trainers] would run them back if they felt their horses came out of it well. The Derby can be 20 horses, so if you get a rough trip, they need that extra time to come back.</p><p>Another Hall of Fame trainer, Shug </p> McGaugheyMcGauhey<p>, a self-proclaimed traditionalist while saying he would be open to new ideas, falls back on whats worked so well all these years.</p><p>No matter who you are, youve got to open your eyes a little bit to whats going to be best for racing and best for the horse, </p> McGaughey McGauhey <p>said. I mean, I think it is exciting and throws a little intrigue into it, with these horses having to run back in two weeks. And usually with that, we get some decent horses that havent run in the Kentucky Derby.</p><p>The only remaining connection to the race is the jockey, and the answer is similar to the trainers.</p><p>I like everything, said Victor Espinoza, who won the Triple Crown aboard American Pharoah</p>  in 2015<p>. I dont think it should be changed at all. Its been done for many, many years and its why not many horses have won a Triple Crown. It requires an incredible and amazing horse to win it and it should stay that way.</p><p>For now, it seems as if racing would be happy just to have a few horses run all three races.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The assessment was issued six months after Bohn had accepted his <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/story/2019-11-06/mike-bohn-to-be-named-usc-athletic-director">new job as USCs athletic director</a>.</p><p>There is no opportunity for the Respondent to answer, as he departed before there was an opportunity for the [Office of Equal Opportunity &amp; Access] to address the concerns with him, the summary of </p> the<p> investigation notes reads.</p><p>Bohn <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/story/2023-05-19/usc-athletic-director-mike-bohn-resigns">resigned from his role as USC's athletic director</a> last week, a day after The Times asked Bohn and USC about internal criticism over his management and conduct. USC hired an outside law firm earlier this year to conduct a review of the culture and climate of the department under Bohns leadership.</p><p>At Cincinnati, where Bohn served as athletic director from 2014 to 2019, documents show the school was conducting its own review at the time of Bohns departure to assess the climate and culture of the athletics department as a whole, according to a copy of the review obtained by The Times through an open records request. That review, part of a second inquiry opened in late October 2019, included 27 interviews with athletic department staff, several of whom said the department had a toxic atmosphere.</p><p>They do not feel comfortable in the Lindner Center building, the report stated, referring to several employees working in the Cincinnati building where the athletics department operated.</p><p>The report concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that staff members may have engaged in conduct in violation of university policy.</p><p>Bohn has declined multiple Times requests for responses to detailed questions about allegations raised by Cincinnati staff members. None of the investigations resulted in a record of public discipline against Bohn.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/25/e4/53f5fb514291afc2526cd9dc5ea7/usc-athletic-director-18707.jpg"></figure><p>Cincinnati has not responded to questions from The Times about Bohns behavior other than providing public records as required by law.</p><p>USC hired Turnkey Search in the fall of 2019 to recruit and vet athletic director candidates. At the time, Turnkeys Lev Perna said the search firm considered more than 80 candidates. </p>Bohn, <p>Perna told <a href="https://huntscanlon.com/turnkey-search-recruits-director-of-athletics-for-usc/">trade publication Hunt Scanlon Media</a></p>, that Bohn <p>was selected because of his integrity, his NCAA student-athlete focus and his people skills.</p><p>USC did not respond to questions from The Times about Bohn or the vetting process prior to his hire.</p><p>Two female Cincinnati staff members told The Times </p> that <p>they met with Title IX officers to share their concerns about Bohns conduct and discuss filing a complaint before the department review was underway.</p><p>One of the women, who asked not to be identified to avoid </p>an<p> adverse </p> repercussionsimpact<p> on her career, went forward with filing a complaint against a supervisor who reported to Bohn. She claimed discriminatory, hostile, retaliatory, and/or disrespectful and unprofessional conduct alleged to violate University policies, according to a copy of the official complaint viewed by The Times.</p><p>In the complaint, the staff member alleges Bohn belittled her and accused her of lying about a job offer from another school.</p> This college football influencer helped ex-USC A.D. Mike Bohn land top jobs<p>Cincinnatis findings in the case, issued in May 2020, ultimately found insufficient evidence of discrimination, retaliation or unprofessional conduct by the woman's </p>her<p> supervisor.</p><p>Kim McGraw, who served as director of business affairs within Cincinnati athletics from 2009 </p> to 20<p>21, raised concerns about Bohn years before he left for USC. McGraw never filed an official complaint, but she met with a Title IX investigator on March 30, 2017, as a witness in an </p>Title IX<p> investigation, according to a notice letter obtained by The Times via an open records request.</p><p>The letter states McGraw told investigators she confronted Bohn about a pay </p>gap <p>disparity between her and two male staff members who were splitting duties of a departing administrator. Bohn, she said, responded that its not an age or gender thing. She said he asked her to sign notes at the end of the meeting indicating the pay dispute was resolved and that she would not file a complaint with the university. She told investigators she refused to sign it.</p><p>McGraw told The Times she saw Bohn make unwanted physical contact with women in the department that made them visibly uncomfortable. The Title IX notice letter does not include any mention of claims involving unwanted physical contact.</p><p>McGraw, who retired in 2021, said she didnt file an official complaint because she was worried about retaliation from the university, Bohn or others in the department who were close to him. Her meeting with Title IX officers only heightened those concerns, she said.</p><p>They led me to believe Id be on my own fighting this, McGraw told The Times. I knew other people had filed complaints or at least went up there to talk to them. I didnt feel like anybody would have my back.</p><p>By 2019, some female staff members in Cincinnatis athletics department had begun to meet discreetly, not only to discuss how to handle their concerns with Bohn and </p> the <p>department, but also </p> to <p>offer </p> one each another <p>emotional support.</p><p>It felt like therapy, one woman said.</p><p>That woman, who filed the Title IX complaint naming Bohn, told The Times that the environment in </p> the departmentathletics<p> was so tense that </p> the womenthey<p> sometimes left </p>discreet their <p>meet-ups one by one, so as to not arouse suspicion from Bohn or others </p>close to him<p> in the department. She said the women discussed clandestinely dropping documents off at the university presidents home because they worried that </p>official channels for<p> filing a complaint </p> through official channels <p>would get back to Bohn and </p> put leave<p> them in danger of retaliation.</p> Plaschke: How did this happen again? USC and Carol Folt are responsible for the Mike Bohn mess<p>Three female </p>athletics department<p> staff members told The Times they were especially concerned because the entrance to Cincinnatis Title IX office was in open view of the athletics department building.</p><p>These arent easy jobs just to lose, one female staff member said. We were so afraid of that.</p><p>During the Title IX </p>investigators<p> administrative review, Cincinnati athletics staff shared similar concerns about the culture of the department with investigators.</p><p>Staff members feel there is no trust in athletics and dont feel that they can confide in anyone without everyone in athletics knowing their concern, the review states.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4e/30/b24b74e44cef9c220ffa6356789e/la-photos-1staff-650383-sp-1113-usc-mike-bohn8-wjs.jpg"></figure><p>Staff members also told investigators they were concerned </p> that the <p>athletics </p> department<p> did not follow university policy regarding hiring or internal promotions. Multiple staff members complained about a lack of diversity in leadership positions and said there was an in crowd within the department of staffers close to Bohn.</p><p>By the fall of 2019, one of the top female staffers in Cincinnatis athletics department had already reached a breaking point with Bohn. Karen Hatcher, Cincinnatis executive senior associate athletic director of principal gifts, met with Title IX investigators on Oct. 29, 2019, three days before The Times reported that Bohn was finalizing a deal with USC to be its next athletic director. USCs hire of Bohn wasnt made official for another five days.</p><p>Hatcher, who is Black, had been promoted into her current fundraising role by Bohn soon after his arrival in 2014. But, according to investigation notes obtained via </p> a <p>records request, their relationship became more contentious as there were a number of unsettling interactions she experienced with [Bohn].</p> "<p>One interaction, which was not described in the note summarizing the case, left Hatcher especially unsettled, according to three sources at Cincinnati with knowledge of the incident.</p><p>The sources say Bohn, while recounting a</p> nspecific<p> episode of a television game show to Hatcher and another senior staff member, repeatedly made racially insensitive comments disparaging the intelligence of a Black family competing on the show.</p> USC names interim administrator to lead athletic department, Big Ten transition team<p>Steven Rosfeld, the other senior staff member present </p> and<p> who is white, eventually brought concerns about disrespectful, unprofessional remarks made by Bohn to the universitys human resources department. The investigation note indicates that he eventually spoke with a Cincinnati assistant athletic director about Bohn on Oct. 30, 2019.</p><p>Hatcher and Rosfeld told Title IX investigators that Bohn previously accused Hatcher of playing the race card after she raised concerns about the lack of minority employees being promoted. Both told investigators that they heard Bohn make disrespectful comments about the race of Cincinnati president, Dr. Neville Pinto. (Pinto is Indian.)</p>.<p> The report did not specify the comments Bohn was accused of making. Another female staff member who asked not to be identified to avoid an adverse impact on her career told The Times she heard Bohn make a racially insensitive comment about Pinto in front of Cincinnati supporters.</p><p>Omar Banks, a former executive senior associate athletic director at Cincinnati, who is Black, told investigators that he heard Bohn question Hatchers knowledge of her position and say that she was only successful in athletics because she is an African American woman.</p><p>Banks told investigators that after he told Bohn he was interviewing for other positions outside of the school, Bohn began taking away his job responsibilities and told senior athletics staff in a meeting that schools were only pursuing Banks because he is Black. Hatcher corroborated that account as part of the universitys investigation.</p><p>That negative treatment, Banks told investigators, led him to leave Cincinnati. He went on to work at Virginia Tech and later served as the athletic director at Campbell University </p> in North Carolina. Mark Ridley-Thomas found guilty of 7 charges in corruption case<p>The other female staff member who filed an official Title IX complaint said she also left in part because of Bohns treatment of her.</p><p>According to the official complaint, she said in a December 2019 interview with Title IX officers that she received an offer from another Power Five school the previous September, but turned it down after Bohn offered assurances that Cincinnati would offer her a $15,000 raise and a courtesy car if she would stay. Soon after she turned down the job, Bohn reneged on those assurances, she said.</p><p>She told investigators that Bohn accused her of lying about receiving the offer from the other institution in a meeting with her supervisor. The woman provided Cincinnati Title IX investigators with copies of text messages confirming shed received the offer.</p><p>She felt that her character was being questioned by Bohn, indicating that he would repeatedly say that [she] only wants money, the complaint states.</p><p>She told The Times the meeting was traumatic and mentally exhausting. She left the department in 2021 after Cincinnati issued its report.</p> Full Coverage: The college admissions scheme<p>Bohn was not the primary respondent in the Title IX complaint, so he was not named in the findings focused on the womans supervisor.</p><p>The five female Cincinnati employees who spoke to The Times each said they felt a mix of relief and frustration when Bohn left for USC.</p><p>We were all ecstatic that he left [for USC], but kind of angry at the same time, McGraw said. He didnt have to pay for any of the damage that he did while he was at UC.</p><p>I just dont understand why it took them so long.</p> LA Times Today: Mike Bohn was being investigated for racial, gender discrimination at time of USC hiring                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But they still gave it an awesome effort, Abdul-Jabbar said Monday. I think it's up to him. Certainly doesn't have to prove anything. And it's just what he wants to do at this point.</p> James and Abdul-Jabbar are featured in the mural along with fellow Lakers greats Magic Johnson, Shaquille ONeal, Kobe Bryant and Anthony Davis.<p>James passed Abdul-Jabbar as the NBAs <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-02-07/lebron-james-passes-kareem-abdul-jabbar-nba-scoring-leader">all-time leading scorer</a> on Feb. 8</p> earlier this year<p>. The two never have had much of a relationship, though Abdul-Jabbar expressed tremendous respect </p>on <p>Monday.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/6b/ab/168fd4a24b31b1f7c35a5ab78c8c/img-2228.jpg"></figure><p>I've never had a chance to talk to LeBron other than two or three minutes," Abdul-Jabbar said. "There's no animosity or resentment there at all. He's done remarkable things. He deserves all the accolades, whatever it is, that he's accomplished.  We might get the chance [to speak]. I certainly wouldn't be against it. As far as where his heart is and the things that he does, I've got nothing but admiration for him.</p><p>The Lakers rallied from a 2-10 start </p>this season<p> to </p>play in  reach<p> the Western Conference finals with Abdul-Jabbar frequently attending </p> games<p>.</p><p>I felt that if they hadn't started out so bad that they could've done a lot better. They seemed like at the end of the season, they were kinda gassed, you know? Abdul-Jabbar said. But they really did a great job of finding a new identity and going out and doing very well. They just missed making it to the Finals. They should be proud of that. I think it's a really neat achievement.</p><p>James is more than 3,000 minutes behind Abdul-Jabbar for most in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar retired after his 20th </p> seasonyear in the NBA<p> in 1989. He joked that once he started failing the ice test (the postgame icing started to become necessary), he knew he had to retire.</p><p>My next-to-last season, the ice started to feel good, he said. I knew it was time to get out of there.</p><p>He played his final season </p>by getting recognized  receiving tributes<p> in one arena after another, the kind of farewell tour some have assumed James will one day want. For Abdul-Jabbar, though, it was an important, if not perfect ending to his career.</p><p>It was hard to deal with all the tributes. It was kind of a distraction, he said. But it also was people that might've always wanted to boo me try and show their appreciation. I really felt that I had to return that. It was a good experience even though it, at times, kind of wore on me.</p>Monday, Abdul-Jabbar, along with other <p>Former Lakers James Worthy, Robert Horry and A.C. Green also attended the unveiling of muralist Jonas Nevers piece off Vermont Avenue and 7th Street.

We have a lot of great young players. We want to do our best to fit the puzzle together. Theres, as you guys know, </p>theres <p>a new collective bargaining agreement now that has different components to it. We want to fit the puzzle together in a way thatll help us compete for championships.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-05-23/lakers-lebron-james-retirement-hint-offseason-posturing">LeBron James</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/203076/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> still appear to </p>still <p>be at the center of that puzzle despite <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-05-22/lebron-james-thinking-about-nba-future-lakers">James musings about retirement</a> after <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-05-22/lakers-denver-nuggets-game-4-series-sweep-recap">the Denver Nuggets</a> completed their sweep of the Lakers </p> on Monday night<p>.</p><p>Again, [we] want to respect LeBrons time and space to continue to process what he needs to process. But LeBron and AD as two pillars is, to us, an unmatched combination that well continue to lean into and build around, Pelinka said. Both incredibly high-character players that want to win and play the game the right way. Were proud of that combination of superstars and want to continue to invest in that and invest in advancing the growth we had this year into next season.</p><p>The Lakers </p>did meet <p>met with Davis </p>today <p>on Tuesday, and Pelinka said he and Ham would speak </p> soon<p> with James</p> , whosoon after he <p>said after </p>last night <p>Monday night's loss that he has a lot to think about </p>in regards to <p>regarding his basketball future.</p><p>The Lakers future, based on Pelinkas comments Tuesday, could look a lot like this years Western Conference runners-up.</p><p><a href="https://www.nba.com/player/1630559/austin-reaves">Austin Reaves</a>, <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/1629060/rui-hachimura">Rui Hachimura</a>, <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/1626156/dangelo-russell">DAngelo Russell</a>, <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/203471/dennis-schroder">Dennis Schroder</a> and <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/1629022/lonnie-walker-iv">Lonnie Walker IV</a> are among the long list of Lakers who are about to enter free agency.</p><p>Reaves free agency could be the most interesting, with the young guard expected to receive interest from the San Antonio Spurs, the Houston Rockets and the Utah Jazz, among other teams. The Lakers can offer Reaves a four-year deal worth</p> approximately<p> about $51 million, while opposing teams can offer almost twice as much. The Lakers, though, can match any opposing offer because of Reaves restricted free agency.</p><p>I mean, I want to be here, Reaves said. This feels like home to me.</p><p>Two years after going undrafted, Reaves developed into the starting shooting guard for the Lakers </p> duringthroughout <p>the playoffs, averaging 16.9 points, </p> per game with <p>4.4 rebounds and 4.6 assists. The Lakers are expected to offer Reaves the maximum they can </p>offer <p>per year in addition to being aggressive in matching any other </p> team's<p> offer.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ee/4e/ed2b0aca4974a808bb0c4047ef19/1296856-sp-0522-lakers-nuggets-game-4-gmf-007.jpg"></figure><p>Austin, in particular, had an incredible year. I think defines really whats at the heart of playing for the Lakers," Pelinka said. "Hes a selfless, team-first guy. He lives in the gym. He loves the big moment. Hes been able to meet the big moment. I think hes a guy that, regardless of what his deal is, I dont think its gonna change him as a person. And well hang our hat on guys like that, that compete, love the game, love their teammates.</p><p>I think were proud to have him as a part of this franchise. And again, without talking about specific players, well do our best to keep this group intact and growing and getting better each year.</p><p>Hachimura, who</p> m<p> the Lakers acquired by sending guard <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2022-04-12/lakers-report-card-kendrick-nunn">Kendrick Nunn</a> and three second-round picks to the Washington Wizards ahead of the trade deadline this season, also will be a restricted free agent and a priority for the team.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/17/fe/bb0c7d044c0780ce8515e8160904/1296851-sp-0518-lakers-nuggets-game-2-wjs-069.jpg"></figure><p>It was one of the best moments, and I think I had a good experience, Hachimura said. You know, I learned a lot of things</p>, you know,<p> from, of course, LeBron</p>, you know<p>, AD, the coaches.  Yeah, it was just, it was great for me</p>, you know<p>. I think it's gonna be great for my career.</p><p>Russell, who came off the bench for Game 4, said the role change in the playoff finale was tough but did little to shake his confidence or his desire to return to the Lakers as an unrestricted free agent this summer.</p><p>Complete success. Honestly, it's been a great time, Russell said. It's been a great experience to come back and be in this position as prepared as I was, give myself a pat on the back for that one. Being able to just adjust and just get thrown into the fire with the team and try to figure it out on the fly and make it to the Western Conference finals, complete success. I really can't complain about anything besides the ball going in when I wanted it to. But other than that, I enjoyed my time.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ce/78/0369bf334cf493a2c6d25f78b859/1295313-sp-0512-g6-lakers-warriors20-wjs.jpg"></figure><p>Other players, such as Schroder, expressed interest in returning.

We had a hell of a season, he said.  We gave everything we have. I gave everything I have, and I think it was </p>was <p>a great, great season.</p> LeBron James retiring?

He powered his team to the Western Conference finals. There, the Lakers were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-05-22/lakers-nuggets-game-4-playoff-analysis-nikola-jokic-anthony-davis">swept by the Denver Nuggets</a>, but James <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2023-05-22/lakers-denver-nuggets-game-4-series-sweep-recap">scored 40 points</a> and played all but 4.3 seconds in the elimination game.</p><p>Coach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2022-12-11/los-angeles-lakers-coach-darvin-ham-saginaw-roots">Darvin Ham</a> didnt offer details about the extra work the 38-year-old James had to do to remain on the </p>floor  court<p> or the discomfort through which he played but acknowledged, It was a challenge.</p><p>The fire inside of James, reduced to a flicker in recent seasons by his failing body and uneven Lakers rosters, suddenly was visible again over these last couple of months.</p><p>You could see the passion, Ham said.</p><p>And you think James actually might retire?</p><p>The impulse that inspired his comeback  that inspired him to become one of the two best players in NBA history  doesnt permanently disappear because of a sweep in the conference finals.</p><p>Before he is a media mogul and before he is a philanthropist, James is a competitor. His instincts will resurface at some point, and he wont be able to walk away. Thats the guess here.</p><p>That also was the guess of Lakers guard Dennis Schroder.</p><p>I cant see that, Schroder said at the Lakers exit interviews. I mean, to retire and the last game in the playoffs you make 40 [points], 10 [rebounds] and nine [assists], I think you still got juice to play a couple more years.</p><p>More than anything, James sounded exhausted after the Lakers Game 4 loss to the Nuggets when </p> he<p> made the comments responsible for the rampant speculation about his future.</p><p>Well see what happens going forward, James said. I dont know. I dont know. Ive got a lot to think about, to be honest.</p><p>Notoriously passive-aggressive, James has developed a reputation as a calculated public speaker, carefully deciding on what to say, and when, to advance a particular agenda. That didnt seem </p>as it was <p>the case here.</p><p>His cryptic remarks were made in response to the final question of the news conference. If he were determined to use the platform to subtly coerce the Lakers into, say, offering him an extension or picking up Kyrie Irving, he would have said so earlier.</p><p>Just for me, personally, going forward with the game of basketball, Ive got a lot to think about, said James, who did not speak to reporters </p>on <p>Tuesday.</p><p>ESPNs Dave McMenamin later caught up with James and asked him to clarify what his comments were about.</p><p>If I want to continue to play, James told him.</p><p>This sounds familiar.</p><p>This sounds like Clayton Kershaw. This sounds like Tom Brady.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/92/df/b51339a44febb1a249a06205162d/1296874-sp-0522-lakers-nuggets-game-4-wjs-035.jpg"></figure><p>This sounds like someone who was spent after making an extraordinary effort to scale a mountain of a season. This sounds like someone who dedicated himself to a tiresome maintenance program to compensate for his body not healing as quickly as it once did. This sounds like someone who emptied a tank that gradually has diminished in size over the years. This sounds like someone who is </p>now <p>wondering if he still has the emotional resources to do it all over again.</p><p>Coming off a tough loss like that, with the work weve put in this season, I think I was ready to retire after last night too, Ham joked.</p><p>Pelinka was understanding.</p><p>Coach and I will speak to LeBron in the coming days, Pelinka said. We all know that he speaks for himself and well look forward to those conversations when the time is right.</p><p>I think sometimes we put athletes, entertainers on a pedestal, but theyre humans. And just like us, they have inflection points in their careers. And our job as the Lakers organization is to support any player on our team if they reach a career inflection point.</p><p>The Kershaws and the Bradys of the world usually come back. James is one of them. Competitors of their caliber dont reach the heights they have because of physical talent alone.</p><p>You never want to see a guy like that leave the game just because of all hes done for it, the level that hes still playing at, Lakers guard Austin Reaves said.</p><p>In the case of James, health could be an extenuating factor. James was an everyday presence on the Lakers injury report throughout the playoffs, and who knows what that required him to do between games. He said previously that surgery was recommended to him while he was out. Is that still the case? If so, how long will the recovery take? What will the rehabilitation process be like?</p><p>Asked if James could undergo surgery, Pelinka wouldnt say. Of the Lakers and James personal medical teams, Pelinka said, Im sure theyll do whats best for him in the offseason.</p><p>Still, the positives of continuing his career outweigh the negatives.</p><p>James is guaranteed $97.1 million over the next two seasons. With his son Bronny a freshman at USC in the fall, he has a very real chance of realizing his dream of playing with him in the NBA.</p><p>Most important: Hes a competitor, and he still can compete at the highest levels</p> of his sport<p>. His return </p> from injurythis year<p> showed that. His 21-point first quarter </p>on <p>Monday night showed that.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

With relievers as volatile as they are, to put them in stressful games every night, to have to use certain guys every night, it gets taxing.</p> Where does top prospect Diego Cartaya fit into the Dodgers' future plans?<p>Thats what made </p> theThursdays <p>6-0 defeat of the Cincinnati Reds </p> on Thursday<p> so refreshing for the Dodgers.</p><p>It wasnt just that the club </p> stoppedsnapped<p> its </p>four-game <p>losing streak </p> at four games<p>, or managed to avoid a series sweep at Great American Ball Park after being walked off the previous two nights.</p><p>Instead, in what has been an all too rare occurrence this season, they got seven strong innings from their starting pitcher, riding <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-06-02/dodgers-yankees-clayton-kershaw-mookie-betts-recap">Clayton Kershaw</a>s nine-strikeout gem to a much-needed, stress-relieving, staff-resetting win.</p><p>Thats why he is who he is, Roberts said of the three-time Cy Young Award winner. Thats why he has the respect of everyone in the league.</p><p>Indeed, Kershaws outing was hardly out of his own personal norm. He has completed at least six innings in nine of 13 starts this season, and gone seven innings in five of them.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/36/b0/7b57a2bc419085e1c8ebdbf7b010/dodgers-reds-baseball-25421.jpg"></figure><p>Thursday was also the third one in which he didnt allow a run, capping the performance by collecting his 2,900th career strikeout.</p><p>In his 16 MLB seasons, Kershaw </p>now <p>has 82 starts of six shutout innings or more. And in his 32 </p>total <p>outings of seven-plus innings and nine-plus strikeouts, the Dodgers have a </p>combined <p>31-1 record.</p><p>Our job as starting pitchers is to pitch deep into games, get those seven</p> -<p>, eight</p> -<p>inning games, reset the bullpen, said Kershaw, who ensured Roberts after the sixth inning he was good for one more frame even with his pitch count </p> at close up to <p>88.</p><p>It all starts with starting pitching, it does, Kershaw added. It might be a little biased to say, but at the end of the day, if you have got good starting pitching, youre going to be in the game. And the way our offense is swinging the bats, we just need to do our job. It felt good to do my job today.</p><p>The problem for the Dodgers: Few of their other starters have followed the future Hall of Famers lead.</p><p>Excluding Kershaw, the rest of the team's rotation is averaging fewer than five innings per appearance.<a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-05-20/dodgers-cardinals-julio-urias-injured-list"> Julio Uras</a>, their opening day starter, has pitched into the seventh only twice. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-05-19/dodgers-beat-cardinals-game-recap">Tony Gonsolin</a>, an All-Star last year, hasnt </p>yet <p>done it once.</p><p>Granted, some of the numbers have been skewed by Noah Syndergaard, who was having a dismal season before being<a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-06-07/dodgers-vs-cincinnati-reds-game-mlb-recap"> placed on the injured list Thursday </a>with a finger blister (though the move will serve just as much as a mental reset for the struggling right-hander).</p><p>Still, for a Dodgers team that is playing without Dustin May, counting on two rookies in their </p>current <p>rotation, and battling inconsistency in the bullpen, more Kershaw-esque outings from other veteran arms could help rectify their unexpected pitching problems.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkomMRXmpEQ<p>It seems like every time Clayton is taking the mound, its a must-win or hes gotta go deep and cover innings, Roberts said. For him to get through seven and for us to use one reliever today  Tayler Scott pitched the final two innings of the Dodgers</p> '<p> fifth shutout  it was enormous.</p><p>Kershaw wasnt alone in arresting the Dodgers season-long losing streak.</p><p>David Peralta had four hits and two RBI</p> s<p>, raising his batting average since May 8 to .344.</p><p>It was a matter of time until everything started coming the way I wanted, said Peralta, who </p>had <p>started the season in an extended slump.</p><p>Freddie Freeman also had two RBIs on two hits. Chris Taylor matched his home run total from </p>all of <p>last season</p>year<p>, collecting his 10th of the campaign on a solo fly. And Austin Barnes added an RBI, his first run driven in and extra-base hit in a month.</p> Agoura High's Jonny DeLuca is poised to complete journey from Dodgers fan to starter<p>Barnes also escaped a potential injury in the ninth. Despite getting drilled by a pitch in his hand following an intentional walk to<a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2023-06-06/dodgers-rookies-james-outman-miguel-vargas-growing-pains"> James Outman</a> with two outs  Kershaw was not a fan of that sequence, calling the decision by Reds manager David Bell pretty ridiculous given the game was all but over  Barnes said </p>postgame <p>X-rays came back clean.</p><p>It didnt feel too good, Barnes told reporters in front of his locker. But it seems like its all right</p> alright<p>.</p><p>The catcher then quickly turned the conversation back toward Kershaw, praising a performance the Dodgers are hoping the rest of their </p>pitching <p>staff can emulate more consistently, as they continue to seek improvements on the mound.</p><p>Hes kind of the stopper for us, Barnes said. We had a couple tough losses, obviously. Its a long season. Games like that are going to happen. Youve got to keep moving. And to get momentum back on our side with what Kersh did was good.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Nevin also expressed confidence in the depth Adell provides for the Angels. If something happens to somebody, we know that [Adell] can come up here and do good things for us, Nevin said. This is where our roster is right now. And Im not to going to say hes leaving tomorrow or the next day. Certainly that home run he hit for us was a big shot in the arm for everybody.<p>Adell and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/angels/story/2023-05-23/mickey-moniak-angels-red-sox-mlb-game-recap">Mickey Moniak</a> were at the end of the outfielder pecking order when the Angels left Tempe</p> , Ariz.,<p> for the spring.</p>  General manager<p> Perry Minasian made sure to fortify depth among the position players in the offseason to help keep a healthy cast of bona fide major league players on the field. Renfroe and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/player/brett-phillips-621433">Brett Phillips</a> were the two offseason outfielder pickups. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/player/luis-rengifo-650859">Luis Rengifo</a>, as well, continued to strengthen his utility abilities, improving at playing in the outfield, as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, Adell and Moniak made their own strides in triple A. After Phillips was designated to Salt Lake City and <a href="https://www.mlb.com/player/jared-walsh-665120">Jared Walsh</a> was activated off the injured list in the middle of May, Moniak was the next man up.

Through it all, Adell continued to work, mentally focused on competing with himself.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/5c/35/ef611edf42fab57f2c81bac5f3c5/angels-diamondbacks-baseball-50606.jpg"></figure><p>I'm playing a game of me versus me, Adell said. I go out and every opportunity I get, I try to compete and see how much better I can be, whether it's practice, weight room stuff, out on the field during the game.</p>Coming into his first game back in the big leagues, Adell  who has not had a complete season in the big leagues since making his debut in August of 2020  said he felt as prepared as he had in the past whenever his name was called up.I think it's the same mission, the same goal as far as preparedness, Adell said.

Lee Smith holds the Angels record for most consecutive saves to start a season, 19,  which he set in 1995. I feel amazing, Estvez said. And knowing how many chances I have got to go out there and get a save, it feels really good doing it with this team. Estvez said he did not know at first that he had reached a milestone last accomplished by Percival, who he met in Tempe when the World Series-winning reliever attended Angels spring camp as a special guest. The Angels told Estvez the significance of his last out. Once they told me that, it just came to my mind the funny conversations [Percival and I] had in spring training, Estvez said.

Good team, good players. So, I think for me it's wherever my role is, wherever I fit into the mix, I'll be happy about that and continue to get better and prove that I belong.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The filing also mentions </p>that <p>UCLA players, coaches and administrators took advantage of hosted food and beverage at a hospitality suite furnished for them as part of their participation.</p><p>The UCLA football social media account posted videos of players participating in the events, </p> with <p>some of them unmasked.</p><p>The announcement at noon on game day that UCLA could not play the game </p> because ofdue to<p> depth concerns at a key position group came as a shock.</p> This college football influencer helped ex-USC A.D.

The force majeure clause could have been negotiated to include pandemic impacts and considerations but was not. As other courts around the country have consistently found, force majeure clauses are interpreted narrowly according to their words such that the Pac-12 is not relieved of its contractual obligations under the express language of the 2019 contract.</p><p>Wednesdays filing comes after more than a year of discussions between the sides.

The 6-foot-5 guard comes with enticing upside after being selected the Naismith College Defensive Player of the Year, as well as questions related to how effective he will be after his recovery.</p><p>Clarks father, Cornelius, told The Times that doctors discovered during </p>the <p>surgery </p>to repair Jaylens injury <p>that his Achilles was unusually tight and they were able to loosen it to improve mobility.</p> Making everywhere he goes his happy place, Adem Bona is a rising star for UCLA<p>They feel like Jaylen is going to be a better athlete than he was before the injury, Cornelius said, adding that his son was ahead of schedule in his recovery and walking unassisted. While there is no definitive timetable for a return, Cornelius said the recovery window for the injury that Jaylen suffered March 4 is roughly one year.</p><p>The return of Bona, the Pac-12 freshman of the year and one of the nations top centers, is a huge plus for a team that could turn over practically its entire roster, giving the Bruins a known quantity to build around.</p><p>We are all very excited about Adem continuing his career in Westwood, </p>UCLA <p>coach Mick Cronin said. Adem is a vibrant, high-character young man who we all love being around every day. He improved immensely during his freshman season, showing his toughness and love for his team by competing through multiple injuries for as long as he could.</p><p>Adem wants to develop further, which will help him have a long NBA career, and he wisely used this pre-draft process. We are going to see great things from Adem next season, and we also appreciate his loyalty to UCLA.</p><p>Bona could be part of a twin towers lineup if the Bruins land <a href="https://nbadraftroom.com/aday-mara/">Aday Mara</a>, a highly coveted 7-</p> foot<p>-3 center who </p>has <p>reportedly terminated his contract with </p>the<p> Spanish </p>professional <p>club Casedemont Zaragoza in advance of an expected move to play college basketball. Maras perimeter shooting could allow him to play alongside the 6-10 Bona, whose game is better suited to playing around the basket.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/8c/06/7e7391bd4179913449928dc1c346/1256910-la-sp-ucla-stanford-jja-0003.jpg"></figure><p>After cutting down on a tendency to pile up unnecessary fouls, Bona was playing his best basketball over the seasons final few months. His averages of 7.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.7 blocks </p>per game<p> did not capture his ability to impact a game on both ends of the court as a shot-blocking menace who also was a </p>constant <p>threat to convert lobs into dunks.</p><p>Bona could not play in the Bruins season-ending loss to Gonzaga in an NCAA tournament regional semifinal <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/ucla/story/2023-03-21/ucla-bruins-basketball-injuries-sweet-16-gonzaga-drew-timme-ncaa-tournament">after hurting his shoulder</a> against Oregon two weeks earlier during the Pac-12 tournament. He suffered the injury while sprawling on the court to chase a loose ball.</p><p>Bona returned the following week to play 20 minutes against Northwestern in the second round</p> of the NCAA tournament<p>, sparking a key fast break with a block while also aggravating his shoulder on a dunk. Hes expected to be able to resume basketball activities this summer.</p><p>Being sidelined will not prevent Clark from holding another <a href="https://www.freefunder.com/campaign/jrock-community-camp">free basketball camp for kids</a> on July 22 at Riverside Norte Vista High. Last year Clark raised $15,000 and put in another $4,000 of his own money to hold a similar camp where he gave out free </p>KD <p>shoes and paid for campers lunches and dinners.</p> UCLA basketball continues to go global with commitment of Slovenian guard Jan Vide<p>Cornelius Clark said his son was close to obtaining his undergraduate degree and expected he would do so even after embarking on an NBA career that seemed unlikely when Cronin plucked the lightly recruited prospect out of Etiwanda High in Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p>Jaylen has been a winning player at UCLA for three years, and we are a better program because he chose to be a Bruin, Cronin said. Jaylen is a classic case that player evaluation and a players intangibles matter. He has had three great years in Westwood. We will miss him but we wish him all the best. Jaylen will always be a Bruin and hopefully one of the more than 120-plus Bruins who were NBA draft picks before him.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The Panthers were swept by the Colorado Avalanche in that Final, and after losing the first two games of this Final to Vegas, their return trip appeared to be following the same futile path.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.nhl.com/player/matthew-tkachuk-8479314">Matthew Tkachuk</a>, who sat out most of the first period and part of the second period Thursday after being rocked by a hit from Keegan Kolesar, wrested control of the game away from the Golden Knights when he tied the score from close range with 2 minutes 13 seconds left in the third period and goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky on the bench in favor of an extra skater.</p><p><a href="https://www.nhl.com/player/carter-verhaeghe-8477409">Carter Verhaeghe</a> triggered a rainfall of rats when he wristed a shot past Vegas goaltender Adin Hill at 4:27 into sudden-death play, cutting Vegas lead in the series to 2-1.</p><p>They were leading most of the game but at the end of the day nobody cares how we got here, Tkachuk said.</p> Elliott: Why a Vegas-Florida Stanley Cup Final is a realization of NHLs Sun Belt-driven dreams<p>Game 4 will be played Saturday at FLA Live Arena, presumably with more toy rats in the clutches of fans who appreciate the spunk of a team that barely made the playoffs as the No. 8 seed in the East and rallied from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Boston Bruins in the first round.</p><p>Its amazing. Im not going to lie, Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov said. Ive been here for a long time and this is the best time in my life to play in front of that crowd and battling for something youve been dreaming of since literally I was born. Its huge.</p><p>Florida took the lead in the first period in their first Stanley Cup Final game at FLA Live Arena, which became its home in 1998 after the team left Miami Arena. But Vegas pulled even during a four-on-three power play, which has been a formidable weapon for them during the Final.</p><p>Panthers defenseman Brandon Montour, who began his career with the Ducks and was traded to Buffalo in 2019, recorded his first point of the Final with a long-range shot through traffic that sailed past Hill at 4:08 of the first period.</p><p>The goal continued a good week for Montour, who became a father for the first time Sunday when his wife, Ryian, gave birth to a son, Kai. Tkachuk earned the primary assist with a fine pass that Montour turned into his seventh goal of the playoffs.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/f2/ba/b588618f4523949319338dd0c4d4/stanley-cup-golden-knights-panthers-76804.jpg"></figure><p>Tkachuk left for the locker room after taking a hit from Kolesar not long afterward, and he didnt emerge for the rest of the period.

Kind of.</p><p>Velas faint effort to dispossess Len of the ball was in vain. About 10 minutes later, the fourth official on the sideline held up an electronic board that flashed the No.10, Velas jersey number. With almost a half-hour remaining in the second leg of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2023-06-04/lafc-loses-to-leon-concacaf-champions-league-final">CONCACAF Champions League final</a>, Vela was replaced by someone named Stipe Biuk.</p><p>Vela didnt produce any magic Sunday night, certainly not the kind of magic that could have reversed LAFCs deficit against Len of Mexico in a game that crowned the best club team in a region that covers North and Central America and the Caribbean.</p> LAFC's CONCACAF Champions League title dreams shattered in loss to Len<p>Len won the game 1-0 and the two-game set with an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2023-06-04/lafc-loses-to-leon-concacaf-champions-league-final">aggregate score of 3-1</a>.</p><p>Vela is 34 years old, and he looked like it.</p><p>He launched a free kick that sailed high over the crossbar and into the stands. He blasted another that crashed into Lens defensive wall.</p><p>He was equally ineffective in the run of play, his diminished reflexes preventing him from dribbling by Lens defenders or even sneaking passes by them.</p><p>He didnt take a single shot on target.</p><p>Carlos wasnt impacting on the game at the moment, coach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2022-01-03/steven-cherundolo-set-to-be-named-lafcs-new-head-co">Steve Cherundolo</a> said of Velas 64th-minute substitution.</p><p>Once the most feared attacker in this part of the world, Vela was as invisible Sunday as he was in a 2-1 first-leg defeat four days earlier.</p><p>Four years removed from the greatest individual season in Major League Soccer history, he was practically reduced to the role of spectator in the most important game in LAFC history.</p><p>Vela looked slow.</p><p>He looked uninspired.</p><p>He looked finished.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/57/95/bb50cb9d469db0338196c0a72a5e/leon-lafc-soccer-concacaf-07016.jpg"></figure><p>Velas contract expires at the end of the current MLS season, and LAFC will now have to decide what to do with the player around whom it built its franchise.</p><p>Vela will turn 35 next March.</p><p>He was guarded earlier in the week when addressing his future.</p><p>I am very happy and I enjoy playing for this club, Vela said in Spanish. In this business, we know anything can happen. We must always be open and willing to listen to whatever may be the best option and decide what is best for my family and me, whether it is here or in Mexico, or even retiring.</p><p>Like Clayton Kershaw on the Dodgers, Vela remains a useful player to LAFC. In 12 regular-season matches this year, he has four goals and five assists.</p><p>Vela is also still one of MLSs most popular players, his jersey the best-selling on the leagues online store as of last month.</p><p>But the Mexican attacker is on a contract that guarantees him $3.3 million this year. MLS roster rules permit teams to carry only three designated players  basically, players who can be paid as much as teams want to pay them  and Vela is one of them.</p><p>As a franchise icon who appeals to LAFCs multicultural and multilingual fan base, a justification can be made for him to retain that designation beyond this season.</p><p>For what Vela provides on the field, no such argument can be made. In a salary-cap league with unusually specific cost controls, giving one of three designated-player slots to Vela would be soccer suicide.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWuXqsh8vjo<p>Vela was the ideal choice to be LAFCs first-ever player. He wasnt just a Mexican player in a Mexican American city. He was also a legitimate world-class talent.</p><p>About the only potential drawback was his reported apathy, a notion he quickly dispelled with his play on the field. He scored. He created for others. He even tracked back on defense.</p><p>In LAFCs second season, in 2019, Vela scored an MLS-single-season-record 34 goals in 31 games. Last year, Vela was part of the LAFC team that captured the franchises first MLS Cup.</p><p>In its brief history, LAFC has distinguished itself from other MLS teams by combining style with substance. Teams such as the Galaxy, Chicago Fire, Toronto FC and Inter Miami have also invested heavily in their rosters but not wisely, turning themselves into circuses. Some of the leagues other successful teams  the Philadelphia Union, in particular, come to mind  have won games by adopting unattractive and cynical styles of play.</p><p>LAFC showed what an MLS team could do if it was as smart as it was ambitious. Vela was a major part of that.</p><p>Perhaps LAFC and Vela can find a middle ground for the sake of continuing their partnership. Perhaps Vela can return as a non-designated player.</p><p>Otherwise, this will likely mark the end of his time with the team. LAFC hasnt become what its become by being sentimental or making major mistakes, and paying Vela millions of dollars beyond this season would be a major mistake.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He has been starting since his freshman season and is 29-1, a better record than three Heisman Trophy</p> -<p>winning quarterbacks at Mater Dei. Every season he has gotten better and there's no reason to think his senior year won't be his best</p> one yet<p>.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest transfer was Husan Longstreet going from Inglewood to Corona Centennial. The </p>c C<p>lass of 2025 standout came close to leading Inglewood to </p>a  the Southern Section<p> Division 2 title, passing for nearly 4,000 yards. Now he joins a program that could challenge Mater Dei and St. John Bosco for No. 1 status.</p><p>Caleb Sanchez was the backup to Pierce Clarkson last season at St. John Bosco, which won the </p> Southern Section<p> Division 1 championship. He'll get the first crack at being the team's No. 1 quarterback. He has the size and intelligence but will be facing </p>a <p>tough nonleague </p> opponents season<p>, so this summer will be critical to gaining confidence and comfort in his new role.</p> https://twitter.com/latsondheimer/status/1588761132147146752?s=20<p>Bear Bachmeier of Murrieta Valley passed for 2,873 yards and 26 touchdowns as a sophomore. He's working on his speed and strength, so the sky's the limit. His brother</p>,<p> Hank</p>,<p> is now the quarterback at Louisiana Tech, and another brother</p>,<p> Tiger</p>,<p> will be a freshman receiver at Stanford.</p><p>Darius Curry of Long Beach Poly was finally healthy and helped the Jackrabbits win the Moore League championship. He'll be surrounded by outstanding receivers.</p><p>Class of 2025 quarterbacks looking to improve on promising sophomore seasons include TJ Lateef at Orange Lutheran, JJ Bittner at Rio Mesa, Jackson Koll</p> oa<p>ck at Laguna Beach and Kingston Tisdell at Birmingham. Madden Iamaleava takes over for his brother, Nico, at Warren.</p><p>As for the transfers, there</p>'s are <p>big expectations. Wyatt Becker went from Sherman Oaks Notre Dame to Sierra Canyon. Michael Tollefson went from San Juan Hills to JSerra. Steele Pizzella </p> went has gone <p>from Simi Valley to Notre Dame. Bryan Wilson left Ayala for Eastvale Roosevelt. Alonzo Esparza </p>s w<p>ent from Sierra Canyon to Los Alamitos. Jaden O'Neal left Los Alamitos for Newport Harbor.</p> https://twitter.com/latsondheimer/status/1665029231951384586?s=20<p>Who isn't excited to see what </p>c C<p>lass of 2026 quarterback Brady Smigiel can accomplish in only his second season at Newbury Park</p>. ?<p> As a freshman, he passed for 3,479 yards and 46 touchdowns.</p><p>Seniors Alonzo Contreras of Calabasas, Boone Lourd of Brentwood, Anthony Wolter of St. Bonaventure and Nate Bennett of Oaks Christian should have outstanding seasons. Junior Tagg Harrison has shown promise at Westlake. Sophomore Luke Fahey could be the next </p> star <p>quarterback </p>star <p>at Mission Viejo.</p> Senior r<p>eturnees Aidan Houston of Cypress and Anthony Lunas of Western passed for more than 3,000 yards.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

They have won six titles since 2016 after getting their first in 2000, all under coach Patty Gasso.</p><p>Oklahoma's only defeat was a 4-3 loss at Baylor on Feb. 19. The Sooners set a record for win percentage and had the fewest losses of any NCAA champion. They led the nation in runs per game, earned run average and batting average  even after losing Division I career home run leader Jocelyn Alo from last year's team.</p><p>UCLA was the only other program to win three straight titles, from 1988 </p> to 19<p>90.

Florida State had taken a 1-0 lead in the fourth on Mack Leonard's homer off Sooners starter Alex Storako.</p><p>Alynah Torres padded the Sooners lead with an RBI single in the sixth, and that was plenty of cushion for Bahl, who struck out three and threw 39 pitches, 28 for strikes.</p><p>Sandercock pitched a complete game for Florida State (58-11), which made its third finals appearance in the last five World Series. The Seminoles won the title in 2018 and were runners-up to Oklahoma in 2021.</p><p>Storako (18-0) worked the first four innings for the Sooners, </p> giving upallowing<p> three hits and getting a sparkling defensive play in the third from center fielder Jayda Coleman, who made a leaping catch at the wall to take away a potential three-run homer from Florida State's Kalei Harding.</p><p>In the top of the third, the Sooners got a bunt single from Rylie Boone  executed so perfectly that the ball stopped on the chalk  to load the bases with no outs. But Sandercock retired the Sooners' top three batters to keep the game scoreless.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bHpcpAIhY                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It was something I chose to do because that is a higher priority than football. So I had to be there.</p><p>But Im very glad to be back.</p><p>On Tuesday, Kupp mainly worked on the sideline with trainers. He went through agility and strength drills, ran short pass routes and counseled younger receivers. At the end of practice, Kupp joined the first-team offense for a two-minute drill conducted at jog-through pace.</p><p>Despite being limited, Kupp </p> was present and his<p> presence on the field was palpable, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/highschool/story/2023-06-01/rams-sean-mcvay-offers-insights-words-of-wisdom-high-school-coaches">coach Sean McVay</a> said.</p><p>He really is an extension of the coaching staff, and he sees so many different things, McVay said. But he really wants to pour into his teammates.</p><p>Kupp, who will turn 30 on June 15, is one of the three pillars on a Rams roster that has undergone a drastic makeover since last seasons embarrassing 5-12 finish. General manager Les Snead traded, released or declined to re-sign nearly two-dozen players as the Rams went into financial retreat </p>mode <p>with an apparent eye toward 2024 and beyond.</p><p>Kupp, the 2021 NFL <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/rams/story/2022-02-10/nfl-awards-cooper-kupp-andrew-whitworth-hall-of-fame">offensive player of the year</a>, is scheduled </p>this season<p> to carry a team-high $27.8-million salary-cap number</p>  this season<p>. That eclipses star defensive lineman Aaron Donald, who has a $26-million cap number, and quarterback Matthew Stafford ($20 million).</p><p>In 2021, Kupp achieved the so-called triple crown of receiving by leading the NFL with 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns. Last season, </p>after suffering an ankle injury, <p>Kupp was sidelined for the final eight games. He finished with 75 catches for 812 yards and six touchdowns, with one rushing touchdown.</p><p>Kupp </p>on Tuesday <p>sounded frustrated that he was not able to return sooner.</p><p>This is not the timeline that we expected this to be, he said, adding, Thats the point of the surgery, to try and get back quicker and, unfortunately, things didnt work out that way."</p><p>When a player suffers a season-ending injury, that season kind of just drags on forever, he said.</p><p>Theres never really a stopping point where you leave the facility, he said, because Ive been in here still rehabbing, doing all that stuff. So it does get long, but man, if you love football it doesnt really matter.</p><p>Kupp said trainers have not given him a</p>n exact<p> date for when he could resume a full workout</p> regimen<p>. But he is feeling really good about his progress.</p><p>Its a good place to be now, he said, where I feel like Im asking for more and wanting to do more and feeling like youre getting held back, versus feeling like theyre pushing you to do more.</p><p>So were in a good place now where I feel like I want to get out there and play, and theyre being cautious with it.</p><p>Kupps absence has enabled receivers such as Van Jefferson, Tutu Atwell and rookie Puka Nacua to take more reps with Stafford, who did not throw passes last offseason because of right elbow tendinitis.</p><p>Stafford, preparing for his 15th </p>NFL<p> season, has been a full participant in offseason workouts. </p>And <p>Kupp said </p>that <p>he and Stafford would work together before </p>the start of <p>training camp.</p><p>Weve already been talking about what thats going to look like, Kupp said, adding, We want to maximize these next couple months and the time we get to have together.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-06-04/denver-nuggets-nba-finals-game-2">Heat beat the Nuggets on Sunday night</a>, sending the series back to Miami with the series tied 1-1. </p><p>Kroenke's deal to purchase the Nuggets, along with the Colorado Avalanche and their home arena for $450 million, included a clause that tethered the NBA franchise to Denver for the next 25 years. These days, the Nuggets are estimated by Forbes to be worth $1.93 billion. </p><p>One thing I know about Stan is that when he sets his mind to doing something, and when he thinks he's right, he's going to fight for that, said Wellington Webb, who was Denver's mayor in 1999 and helped broker the deal that closed a year later between Kroenke and the Nuggets.</p><p>Though Kroenke married into money  he wed Walmart heiress Ann Walton in 1974, a few years after meeting her during a ski trip to Aspen  he had already honed his business chops. His first deal: taking a $1,500 loan at 6% interest from his dad so he could buy part of a clothing shop with his friend. </p> Heat surge past Nikola Jokic and Nuggets to win Game 2 of NBA Finals<p>Not long after, he got into the real estate business, building shopping centers with a developer who was tight with Walmart founder Sam Walton. </p><p>Real estate and sports are, these days, almost intertwined  a reality Kroenke grasped quickly. </p><p>I always thought Id enjoy [owning a sports franchise] because the professional sports business is part business and part sports, Kroenke told the Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune in 2022, and I love both of them.</p><p>Kroenke's representatives did not return messages left by the Associated Press seeking an interview.</p><p>His first major jump into sports was his partnership with Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. In the mid-1990s, Frontiere was chafing at the inability of Los Angeles to build a new stadium. She was looking for partners to bankroll a move to St. Louis. Kroenke bought in, and when Frontiere died in 2008, he exercised his right to purchase a majority stake in the team.</p> Rams owner Stan Kroenke escalates property buying spree in Woodland Hills<p>The sad irony is that it was Kroenke, the Missouri native, who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/super-bowl/la-sp-super-bowl-rams-kroenke-20190201-story.html">moved the Rams out of St. Louis and back to L.A.</a> where they are the main tenant in his $5.1-billion stadium. His connection with Denver is much different. </p><p>One of my dreams was to be involved in a professional basketball team, Kroenke told yhe Denver Post, shortly after closing the deal for the Nuggets. This is a dream Ive had for a long time.</p><p>There is, in fact, a strong argument that the basketball trophy might be the most meaningful for a family that has amassed three Stanley Cup trophies with the Avalanche, a Super Bowl trophy with the Rams and is still looking for glory with Arsenal, the Premier League soccer team it has had a controlling interest in since 2011. </p><p>Kroeke's son</p>,<p> Josh</p>,<p> was a standout basketball player in high school and played at </p> the <p>University of Missouri. He now runs the Nuggets. </p> His mother is the listed owner  of  for the Nuggets and Avalanche since NFL rules preclude Stan Kroenke from owning the Rams and a team from another American pro sports league.<p>I thought that you could bring a championship to Denver, Josh said in a recent interview on team-owned Altitude Sports Radio. Trying to do something thats never been done before, its not always easy, and its usually met with a lot of resistance. ... Were mostly excited for the city to get to experience this. But the jobs not done.</p> NFL and Rams agree to $790-million settlement with St. Louis over relocation<p>The Nuggets were parked squarely in NBA purgatory when the team went on the block in 1999, having not sniffed relevancy since their mid-80s </p> heyday heydey<p>, when the teams were highlighted by coach Doug Moes uptempo offense. Their situation off the court wasnt much better. In the late '80s, then-owner Sidney Shlenker had toyed with the idea of moving the team to Memphis. </p><p>His sale to a media conglomerate that was never truly hot on owning sports teams did nothing to tamp </p> down <p>the idea that the Nuggets were a team that might be available to move. And teams were moving; Between 2001 and 2008, Memphis (from Vancouver), Oklahoma City (from Seattle) and New Orleans (from Charlotte) all adopted existing franchises in a flurry of NBA reshuffling.</p><p>When </p> the Nuggets were put up for sale, Denver went on the block,<p> the highest bidder, billionaire businessman Donald Sturm, came in with a $460-million offer, but balked at the </p> restriction idea<p> that he couldn't move the team. </p><p>In stepped Kroenke, who had no problem with the arrangement. A side note: To close the sale, Kroenke had to outmaneuver another group fronted by none other than John Elway.</p><p>It was clear Sturm wasn't going to work out, Webb said. And my only question was, Is the new guy going to be supportive of the team winning? Because if the arena is full, not only do the owners make money, but </p> [the]<p> city makes money, as well.</p><p>The Kroenkes have answered Webb's question with their willingness  increasingly rare in pro sports  to play the long game, both on the roster and on the bench. </p> King under the court: Meet the man behind the Miami Heat's new style of Showtime<p>The roster was built in workmanlike, no-drama fashion, highlighted by Nikola Jokic, who entered the league as an unheralded second-round draft pick from Serbia. The coach, Michael Malone, was hired in 2015, and there was never much talk of making changes after disappointing finishes to their seasons in 2018, 2019 and even last year. </p><p>Today, Malone sits behind only Gregg Popovich (Spurs), Erik Spoelstra (Heat) and Steve Kerr (Warriors)  who have a combined 11 championships on their coaching resumes  in terms of longevity among the NBA's 30 head coaches.</p><p>That has a ton to do with where we are today, Malone said. I couldnt be more thankful for working for an ownership group that is not impatient and is not trying to find the next great thing, but is saying, Hey, listen, lets let this grow and marinate into something special.'"</p><p>Despite his family's large role in the Denver sports scene  the Kroenke business also owns the MLS Colorado Rapids and the National Lacrosse League's Colorado Mammoth, who lost the deciding game in that league's title series Saturday  Kroenke has still taken his fair share of criticism around town.</p><p>It's a byproduct of his 2004 move to bundle his teams TV rights and air them on </p> his<p> company's new regional television network, Altitude. </p> Lakers' Austin Reaves to play for Team USA in FIBA World Cup<p>In 2019, the regions biggest cable operator, Comcast, stopped carrying Altitude due to a disagreement over fees the cable giant was charging to carry the network. The ensuing legal battle has kept the Nuggets off the local airwaves in millions of homes for the last four seasons. The battle between billion-dollar companies has left many average Nuggets fans feeling like </p> they are <p>the only real losers in the equation.</p><p>But whatever bitterness lingers from the cable dispute has mostly been set aside over the past few months. All the playoff games have been on national TV. </p><p>Meanwhile, Kroenke stays firmly in the background. He can make it from his apartment at the top of Ball Arena through some back passageways and into his luxury suite to watch games in less than two minutes. Sometimes he brings his German shepherd along.</p><p>I think that not only is he a good businessman, Webb said, but he also feels he has something special in Denver. And I think it's always been his goal to do right by Denver.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Atwell split two defenders and then outmuscled them to make the catch.</p><p>Last season, Stafford and the speedy Atwell connected on a couple of deep passes.

Now, the group is thinking more about a reboot.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2022-03-17/sebastian-joseph-day-chargers-defense">Sebastian Joseph-Day</a> explained Monday that he believes increased familiarity will lead to increased performance.</p><p>I think this year, that chemistry is built, the veteran defensive tackle said. Chemistry is built through trials and tribulations. I really believe that that is going to shape us in a way better way moving forward.</p><p>Last offseason, Joseph-Day was part of a defensive overhaul that also included the additions of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2022-07-26/khalil-mack-soft-reputation-chargers-nfl-star">Khalil Mack</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2022-10-24/chargers-j-c-jackson-injury">J.C. Jackson</a>, Austin Johnson, Morgan Fox, Kyle Van Noy and Bryce Callahan.</p><p>Despite the influx of proven play and experience, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers">Chargers</a> still finished 20th in yards allowed and 21st in points surrendered. They were last in the NFL </p> against the run,<p> giving up an average of 5.4 yards per rush.</p><p>This offseason, their only veteran addition has been linebacker <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-04-17/former-ucla-star-linebacker-eric-kendricks-vikings-free-agent-chargers">Eric Kendricks</a>, who will take over for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-03-17/chargers-lose-tackle-leader-drue-tranquill-chiefs">Drue Tranquill</a>. The Chargers also havent re-signed Van Noy or Callahan and didnt bring back <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-03-16/chargers-safety-nasir-adderley-25-retires">Nasir Adderley</a>, who decided to retire.</p><p>The group otherwise largely remains intact, that continuity something Joseph-Day suggested will make a difference in 2023.</p><p>Thats what we have now because everyones kind of seen how each other plays, he said. I think thats the biggest thing, the cohesion thats come together.</p><p>Joseph-Day likened the situation to a basketball team needing time to adjust to the various playing styles and differing strengths of its individual parts.</p><p>He also said he's convinced the arrival of Kendricks, who spent the first eight </p>years <p>seasons of his career with the Minnesota Vikings before signing with the Chargers as a free agent, will help with the defensive communication.</p><p>I think having Eric in there is definitely going to help us get those adjustments faster  less wasted time, less thinking, Joseph-Day said. Hell be able to see that faster and get that communicated to us.</p><p>That will help, honestly, everyone play faster. At the end of the day, you cant play defense slow. The moment youre a step behind or you miss something, thats how you get got.</p><p>Joseph-Day and Tranquill engaged in a heated sideline exchange during a </p>December <p>game in December against the Tennessee Titans over a communication problem.</p><p>The Chargers didnt pursue re-signing Tranquill and instead turned to Kendricks, </p>who head coach <p>whom <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-05-12/week-5-off-chargers-coach-brandon-staley">coach Brandon Staley</a> has praised for his leadership and production while playing in a similar scheme with the Vikings.</p> AlthoughWhile<p> the bulk of their on-field personnel has remained the same, the Chargers do have a new defensive coordinator. Former secondary coach Derrick Ansley took over in February for Renaldo Hill.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/49/3c/960d996040418b6e55afc8cbcfbe/chiefs-chargers-football-59043.jpg"></figure><p>Staley will continue to call plays on game days and mastermind the defense, but Ansley has assumed an increased role. He last coordinated a defense at the University of Tennessee in 2020.</p><p>He has this calm urgency about him that I really enjoy, Joseph-Day said. Its intense, but its calm. Its really interesting. I really like the mentality hes bringing.  I think its everything we need right now.</p><p>The Chargers defense has two significant health issues that will be monitored closely this summer. Jackson and Johnson both are coming back from season-ending knee injuries.</p><p>Jackson has been ramping up his football activity and told the NFL Network last week that he hopes to be 100% for the start of training camp in late July.</p><p>Johnson was on the field Monday working with other rehabilitating players and appeared to be moving well.</p><p>The return of Jackson, a </p>Pro Bowler <p>Pro Bowl selection with New England in 2021, would give the Chargers the option of playing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-01-14/news-analysis-chargers-jaguars-unforgettable-playoff-comeback">Asante Samuel Jr.</a> more at slot corner, increasing the defense's depth.</p><p>He has really good instincts, really good balance and body control, Ansley said of Samuel. He can communicate and plays well with others inside. He has a unique skill set that he can play inside and out, which is why we drafted him.</p><p>The Chargers also have defensive tackle <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-04-24/salary-cap-money-chargers-need-nfl-draft-picks">Otito Ogbonnia</a> working his way back from a season-ending knee injury. As a rookie in 2022, Ogbonnia was making solid strides before he got hurt in Week 10.</p><p>Last month, the Chargers used their second-round pick on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-04-28/chargers-drafi-usc-linebacker-tuli-tuipulotu-second-round">Tuli Tuipulotu</a>, an edge rusher from USC. Though only 20 years old, Tuipulotu is in a position to earn a vital contributing role as a rookie.</p><p>Hes one of those old souls, Ansley said. He's all football. He's trying to find the extra things that are going to help his game. He's going to be fine that way. The older he gets, those things will help.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Though not prime time, that is a cherished, late-afternoon television time slot.</p><p>The teams </p>then<p> wont meet again until Week 18 at SoFi Stadium. By that point, the rematch could lack postseason implications, robbing it of its usual significance.</p><p>Then again, the game could greatly impact the playoff situations for both </p>teams<p> and thus be flexed into the final prime-time spot of the regular season.</p><p>Either way, the Chargers will receive ample national exposure as they continue their quest to more firmly establish a local foothold.</p><p>The NFL is going to tell you what they think of your team by how many [prime-time games] you get, coach Brandon Staley said Friday. We have a good football team, and were going to be excited to play whenever we play. But, obviously, when youre in front of the whole world, its extra special.</p><p>Staley spoke on the opening day of the Chargers rookie minicamp at the teams headquarters. Here are a few more highlights from Costa Mesa:</p><p><b>Recess here already?</b> The Chargers are one of four teams  joining Cleveland, Seattle and Tampa Bay  with the earliest possible off week. They dont play Week 5.</p><p>This is typically not ideal, </p> with<p> most NFL personnel preferring to receive their break later in the season after the players have absorbed more body blows.</p><p>Asked for his opinion, Staley recalled the 2018 season, when he was an assistant with Chicago and the Bears were off Week 5. That team opened 3-1 and lost two straight after the break, before finishing 12-4 and earning a wild-card spot.</p><p>That's my experience to draw from, Staley said. I just know that  no matter what your bye is, we'll be ready to play the schedule as it comes.</p><p><b>First-rounder cashes in:</b> The Chargers signed six of their seven draft picks, the lone exception being second-round edge rusher <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-04-28/chargers-drafi-usc-linebacker-tuli-tuipulotu-second-round">Tuli Tuipulotu</a>.</p><p>Wide receiver <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-04-27/chargers-big-speedy-receiver-21st-pick-nfl-draft">Quentin Johnston</a>, the No. 21 pick overall, received $14.18 million fully guaranteed  according to <a href="http://overthecap.com/">overthecap.com</a>  on his four-year deal.</p><p>Honestly, it was just another stepping stone, he said. The money is cool, but I don't plan on sitting there and blowing it. I'm going to have it in my savings account. I'm not really focused on the money. Im focused on football.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/cd/33/ae0e9ad240a9b2ee98e06c21cdd6/chargers-rookie-camp-football-24907.jpg"></figure><p>After he was drafted, Johnston thanked his parents and announced that his mother, Sherry, could now retire. The NFL distributed a video of the moment to widespread applause.</p><p>She called me two days ago saying that she just put her notice in, Johnston said. She's trying to wait until we get a little break so that I can be up there and throw a little celebration for her.</p><p>Johnston was asked about the significance of being able to thank his mother in such a way.</p><p>I'm a big family person, he said. I wouldn't be in this position I am today if it wasn't for both of my parents and the sacrifices that they made, getting me to and from different games, different practices, different events when they had stuff planned already.</p><p>I would've done the same thing for my dad [Carl], but my dad was already retired, so I just gave him a pat on the back.  To give back to them and see the look on their faces, it's everything.</p><p><b>Wideouts bonding already:</b> Johnston said he has not </p>yet<p> met quarterback Justin Herbert, though he did note that Herbert recently followed him on Instagram.</p><p>The rookie, however, said he has talked with veteran Chargers wide receivers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/chargers/story/2023-03-01/chargers-gm-tom-telesco-salary-cap-keenan-allen">Keenan Allen</a>, Mike Williams and Joshua Palmer. They visited him at his hotel during his trip to Costa Mesa after being drafted.</p><p>They hit me up, said that they wanted to meet up, talk, get to know me, as well as me getting to know them, Johnston said. It was a good experience.</p><p>The Chargers are hoping Johnstons transition can be aided </p> bygiven<p> the leadership they already have at the position.</p><p>For them to do that, I'm not surprised, Staley said. That's what you need from the leaders on your football team because that's going to accelerate the development of your young guys. I'm glad that that's happening.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Messi even confirmed it himself.</p><p>"I made the decision that I'm going to go to Miami," Messi said in Spanish in a <a href="https://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/messi-exclusiva-voy-inter-miami-88424839">brief video released Wednesday by Diario Sport</a>, a Spanish sports daily. "I still haven't finalized it 100%. Were missing some things. But weve decided to continue on this path.</p><p>Its a path that could prove transformative for MLS, already the fasting-growing top-tier soccer league in the world.</p><p>Jorge Mas, Inter Miamis CEO and managing owner, teased the announcement by posting a stylish picture of a No. 10 Inter Miami jersey  Messis number  <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorge__Mas/status/1666519613616664577">on his social media account</a> while the league released a cautiously optimistic two-sentence statement.</p><p>We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami CF and Major League Soccer this summer, it read. Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our League.</p> Why Christian Pulisic still supports Gregg Berhalter amid messy coaching drama<p><a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/">MLS</a> has more than doubled in size, from 12 to 30 teams, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2020-02-28/david-beckham-signing-with-the-galaxy-made-lasting-impact-on-mls">since David Beckhams arrival</a> in 2007 and expansion fees have gone from $10 million to half a billion dollars over that span. Last year MLS had the sixth-highest average attendance of any soccer league on the planet, and with the World Cup returning to North America in three years, the sport is primed to break through a crowded sports landscape in the U.S.</p><p>Messi will supercharge that push.</p><p>A seven-time world player of the year Messi, who will turn 36 later this month, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2022-12-18/greatest-world-cup-final-caps-unique-qatar-tournament">led Argentina to its first World Cup title in 36 years</a> last fall, bringing him the only major prize his resume was missing. In 17 seasons with Barcelona, he won 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns while leading Europes top leagues in scoring six times. He spent the last two years in France, winning two league championship with Paris Saint-Germain, and his 806 goals for club and country ranks second all-time behind only Cristiano Ronaldo.</p><p>Barcelona, which failed in its attempt to lure Messi back for an encore, said club president Joan Laporta was informed of the players decision Monday. On Wednesday the team issued a statement of its own that appeared to belittle MLS, saying that it respected Messis decision to want to compete in a league with fewer demands, further away from the spotlight and the pressure he has been subject to in recent years.</p><p>The player, who two years ago spent $7.2 million to buy the entire ninth floor of a luxury condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., seemed to back that view, telling the Spanish sports newspaper Mundo Deportivo that he wanted to leave Europe, get out of the spotlight, and think more about my family."</p><p>After winning the World Cup and not being able to return to Barcelona, it was my turn to go to the league of the United States to live football in another way and to enjoy the day-to-day more, he added.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e5/90/e7ee0804435c936506a048ee8268/aptopix-wcup-argentina-france-soccer-59653.jpg"></figure><p>The fact that a league with a salary cap was able to outbid the deep-pocketed Saudi Pro League, Paris Saint-Germains Qatari owners and Barcelona, which Deloitte ranks as the seventh-richest club in the world, is astonishing. And it took a lot of creativity and cooperation from MLS and two of the leagues primary partners, Apple and Adidas, to get it done.</p><p>The financial details of Messis Inter Miami contract have not been released, but he reportedly earned a base salary of more $40 million a season in his two years with PSG and was offered $400 million a year to play in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>MLS teams have an annual payroll of $5.21 million. For the </p>entire team<p>. Messi would have made that much in less than a week in Riyadh.</p><p>But MLS permits teams to sign as many as three designated players to unlimited salaries, just a fraction of which applies to the cap. That rule was adopted in 2007 to allow <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer">the Galaxy</a> to sign Beckham for a then-record $6.5 million a season.</p> Commentary: Galaxy President Chris Klein's dismissal was inevitable amid record poor stretch<p>The league sweetened that offer by including a clause that allowed Beckham to buy an MLS expansion franchise for $25 million, an offer he accepted in 2013 when he joined the ownership group in Miami. With the signing of Messi, Beckham is altering the trajectory of MLS a second time. But with expansion fees now going for $500 million, the league had to find another way to finance the deal.</p><p>So MLS looked to its partners, according to league sources with knowledge of the negotiations not authorized to discuss them publicly. Apple, in the first season of a 10-year $2.5-billion agreement to carry league games on its <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-06-14/apple-tv-will-become-the-exclusive-streaming-home-for-major-league-soccer">Apple TV</a> streaming platform, will help underwrite the contract as will Adidas, the leagues kit sponsor, which has worked with Messi since 2006. Both could benefit mightily from the signing with Apple, which announced Tuesday that it will be airing a four-part documentary series on Messis World Cup win last fall, anticipating a surge in international subscriptions to its MLS Season Pass package.</p><p>But its unlikely anyone will benefit from Messis decision more than MLS, which is getting a priceless boost in both attention and prestige.</p><p>The financial impact of the deal is already being felt in some corners of the league despite the fact its not even final yet: With Messi expected to make his MLS debut in July, the asking price for tickets to Inter Miamis Sept. 3 game with LAFC at BMO Stadium topped $4,700 on the secondary market Wednesday afternoon.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

on July 5, 2019, out of temporary office space in Manhattan Beach, when an earthquake briefly interrupted their plan to change the course of franchise history.</p><p>The earthquake struck while the group was attempting to put the final details together to trade with Oklahoma City for All-Star <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-04-26/plaschke-clippers-blow-it-up-trade-kawhi-leonard-paul-george">Paul George</a>, and secure the commitment of free agent and NBA Finals most valuable player <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-04-26/plaschke-clippers-blow-it-up-trade-kawhi-leonard-paul-george">Kawhi Leonard</a>. Seeing windows shaking and </p> tiles ceiling <p>falling from the ceiling</p> tiles<p>, Winger and his <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers">Clippers</a> colleagues ran toward what they hoped was a structurally integral area.</p><p>"We all ended up in a stairway, in our minds, running for our lives," Winger said. </p><p>Once the shaking subsided, they ran back to their makeshift workspace and their conference calls to secure a startling transaction.</p><p>The public didnt know about the moment in part because Winger kept such a low profile as the teams second highest-ranking basketball executive. He didnt hold public interviews. In six seasons, the team kept only so much as a headshot of Winger. But other teams around the NBA knew plenty about Winger and his renown for understanding the leagues collective bargaining agreement and salary cap. A few teams checked on his interest in leaving the Clippers. Each time, he stayed.</p><p>Until Wednesday. After weeks of conversations with Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-05-24/clippers-gm-michael-winger-hired-washington">Winger agreed to become Washingtons pPresident of Monumental Basketball</a>, a role in which he will oversee all of Washingtons basketball operations</p>, from<p> the Wizards, </p>to<p> the WNBAs Mystics, </p>to <p>the G League affiliate Capital City Go-Go, and all </p> of the <p>facilities those teams use.</p><p>In his first interview since his hiring, Winger told The Times on Thursday that he left now because he had reached a point in his career, which included previous stops in Cleveland and Oklahoma City, where he wondered whether he would have an opportunity to be a lead executive.</p><p>And if I do ever have the opportunity to do it will I have the opportunity to do it for the right owner, for the right fan base and the right market? he said.</p>told The Times.<p> And seldom I think in pro sports do those opportunities come along where almost all of your boxes, if not all of your boxes, are checked. And this was I think the rare and supremely fortunate opportunity for somebody like me to check all the boxes: ownership, market, fan base, already a talented team.</p><p>The geography helped. Winger lived in Baltimore during his last year of law school while also working for a sports agent, and had strong memories of driving into D.C. to visit friends.</p><p>I just felt like if I'm ever going to challenge myself, now's the time and Ted's the right person, he said. I think D</p> .<p>C</p> .<p> is the right fan base.</p><p>Winger plans to officially wind down his role with the Clippers next week before turning his attention fully on the Wizards. He will leave behind a six-year tenure in which Winger, as part of a brand-new front office under <a href="https://www.nba.com/clippers/lawrence-frank">Lawrence Frank</a>, president of basketball operations,</p> <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/clippers/lawrence-frank">Lawrence Frank</a></p>,<p> traded Blake Griffin to transition the Clippers from their Lob City era to that of Leonard and George in less than 18 months. </p><p>He said he leaves most pleased that team owner <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2021-09-23/clippers-steve-ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a> is happy with the team and progress on a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2022-11-15/inside-steve-ballmer-perfect-nba-arena">new Inglewood arena</a>, slated to open in 2024, and that the team  once a place league staffers and players avoided under the ownership of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-donald-sterling-20140803-story.html">Donald Sterling</a>  had become an attractive destination.</p><p>In February, he was one of several key voices supporting the addition of guard <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-04-28/clippers-russell-westbrook-free-agent-tyronn-lue-support">Russell Westbrook</a>, whom he knew well from Oklahoma City, loved that Westbrook ultimately joined and revived his career.</p><p>Far shorter, he said, was the list of the plans that had yet to materialize. Injuries have cut short each of the teams last three postseason runs, including in 2021, when the deepest postseason in franchise history ended in the conference finals  a run he feels confident would have gone further if healthy.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/74/e3/5835de3c4dfb9347c87271ec7acd/clippers-nuggets-basketball-08093.jpg"></figure><p>I would have liked to have won one or more championships in the four years that we've had Paul and Kawhi, but every team that tries to win a championship and doesn't wishes that they would have won a championship, Winger said. I mean, certainly winning at the highest level would have been awesome. What else? That's really it.</p><p>I personally am gonna be sad that I don't get to experience however many years Paul and Kawhi have left together because I think that they are a championship tandem. I believe that to my core that those two guys when healthy can absolutely win a championship, so Im a little sad that Im not gonna be there when they finally do.</p><p>His challenge with the Wizards is not dissimilar to </p> wt<p>hat he walked into with the Clippers in 2017  turning a team with a history of playoff shortcomings into a viable contender.</p><p>The Wizards last made the playoffs in 2021, their only postseason appearance since 2018. The franchise has not advanced past the second round since 1979. Winger has familiarity with the coach tasked with the turnaround, as Wes Unseld Jr. interviewed with the Clippers for their top job in 2020.</p><p>While interviewing with Washington, Winger said relatively little time was spent charting his immediate thoughts for a roster that is slightly below the luxury tax with 13 players under contract. Part of that is because Winger will be recruiting and hiring executives in charge of each team, and the plan for the Wizards will be one crafted later by that future executive and Winger.</p><p>We are going to search for a single person to run the Wizards, he said.</p><p>In the whirlwind of his previous 24 hours since his hiring became public, he had yet to speak with any players. That includes All-Star shooting guard Bradley Beal, one of the leagues top scorers but </p> who <p>has battled to stay healthy. The five-year max contract he signed in 2020 includes a no-trade clause.</p> As NBA coaching carousel turns, Tyronn Lue is said to be seeking security with Clippers<p>His former coaches, his former teammates, they all have extraordinarily high regard for him, and he is unequivocally a superstar, Winger said. The hardest thing to do in the NBA is acquire a superstar talent and it's even harder to acquire superstar talent with his level of character. And so, I think it's an extremely, extremely fortunate starting point. So to me, that's really exciting to have somebody like Brad on the team.</p><p>The bulk of his conversations with Leonsis, Winger said, were spent on finding where they aligned on what he called a big-picture vision for building an organization. Winger values process. So does Leonsis, he said. Leonsis wanted to know Wingers thoughts on developing a culture that could lead to sustainable success.</p><p>Hes had a key role with a similar effort before, in Los Angeles. Washington presents a familiar task  with, perhaps, fewer earthquakes.</p><p>Leonsis is willing to put forth both the resources and the patience to incrementally build a highly functional, adaptive organization, and if you have that the results almost take care of themselves, Winger said. And I was </p>I was <p>drawn to that vision. And he's demonstrated that with the Capitals [who won the 2018 Stanley Cup].</p><p>The proof is right there. It's just a matter of taking some of those principles, injecting the equivalent of the NBAs nuances into those principles, and hopefully building something that is sturdy, sound, attracts good players, attracts good staff, keeps good players, keeps good staff, and ultimately wins basketball games.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Coach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-02-08/clippers-coach-tyronn-lue-usa-basketball">Tyronn Lue</a> said he expects to return for a fourth season. And <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2020-10-08/clippers-lawrence-frank-chosen-nba-executive-of-the-year">Lawrence Frank</a>, the teams president of basketball operations, heaped praise on Lue while saying firmly that Lue would return.</p><p>"Of course he's back," Frank said </p> on <p>April 27. "Ty is a terrific coach, and we're excited to have him as our coach."</p><p>Yet the Clippers </p>nonetheless <p>now find themselves in an unsettled situation, as described by </p> peoplesources <p>within the league not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.</p><p>Teams with vacancies, including Milwaukee but particularly Phoenix, are said to covet Lues acumen and championship credentials. For those </p>very <p>same reasons, of course, so do the Clippers, who have little incentive to allow any suitors  let alone within their division, in the case of Phoenix  </p>the<p> permission </p>required <p>to </p>even <p>speak with him as a candidate.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the Clippers have made clear their pleasure that Lue is their coach. Yet, although Lue has two years remaining on his five-year contract, the last season in 2024-25 is not guaranteed, said a person with knowledge of the terms. </p><p>That, combined with the job security of even accomplished NBA coaches seemingly growing even shakier in recent weeks  Mike Budenholzer and Monty Williams are out of jobs in Milwaukee and Phoenix, </p> respectively, <p>only two years after meeting <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2021-07-20/giannis-antetokounmpos-50-points-lead-bucks-to-nba-title-over-suns">in the NBA Finals</a>  are factors as to why discussions of Lue seeking more security have begun to filter throughout the leagues scouting summit.</p><p>Bleacher Report reported Wednesday that security could come in the form of either an extension or a new deal</p> altogether<p>. It also reported that Lues representatives had begun discussions with the Clippers, but league sources would not confirm that any such discussions had</p>, in fact,<p> taken place.</p> Plaschke: Clippers need to blow it up. Trade Kawhi Leonard. Or Paul George. Or both<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2020-10-15/clippers-finalizing-deal-to-hire-tyronn-lue-as-next-coach">The Clippers promoted Lue</a> in 2020 over candidates including future Lakers coach <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2022-12-11/los-angeles-lakers-coach-darvin-ham-saginaw-roots">Darvin Ham</a> and future Sacramento coach Mike Brown, believing Lue was the best fit to guide a two-superstar team with title ambitions, and </p> they <p>still feel </p> that way the same<p>. Though this most recent season produced frustration over injuries and a first-round </p> playoff<p> exit, Lue has built a strong rapport with team owner <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2022-11-15/inside-steve-ballmer-perfect-nba-arena">Steve Ballmer</a>; the pair even traveled together last summer to Lues hometown of Mexico, Mo.</p><p>Lue owns a 261-186</p> overall<p> record as a head coach, including parts of four seasons with Cleveland. Lue is 133-103 in the regular season with the Clippers and 11-13 in the playoffs. </p>and  He <p>guided the franchise on its deepest postseason run, to the conference finals, in 2021.</p><p>It will not be the only key decision on the franchises future Ballmer must make this summer. Lues five-year contract lined up with those of the teams starring but oft-injured duo of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/clippers/story/2023-04-27/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-clippers-future">Kawhi Leonard and Paul George</a>, both of whom are entering the final guaranteed season</p> s<p> of their contracts. Both hold player options in 2024-25. What makes this summer a potential signal of the teams long-term belief in the current iteration of the roster is that </p>both <p>Leonard and George are eligible to sign extensions that can reach up to four years and $220 million apiece.</p> Kawhi Leonard and Paul George remain at center of Clippers' future, team exec says<p>Before tearing his meniscus during the postseason, Leonard had regained the form of an </p>a<p>All-NBA forward, which was encouraging </p> after following <p>his return from a torn knee ligament that sidelined him all of </p> the <p>2021-22 </p> season<p>. And George, before he sprained his right knee, earned his eighth All-Star selection.</p><p>Would the players ask for the full value, and would the team extend it? In 2021, Leonard said he re-signed on a longer-term deal worth more money over shorter options because he wanted financial security coming off of a knee injury. This summer, he is also dealing with his meniscus injury. Whether Leonard opts for surgery or not, Frank predicted that Leonard would be ready to start the season in October.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
