One of the photos shows a stack of boxes that had fallen over in a storage room. Visible in the photo are documents marked with a designation that the information can only be released to the closest allies of the U.S.: Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Trump is charged with willful retention of national defense information; conspiracy to obstruct justice; withholding a document or record; corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation; scheming to conceal; and false statements and representations.</p><p>In a brief televised statement, Smith urged the public to read the indictment in order to understand "the gravity of the crimes charged." He also said he was aiming for a speedy trial.</p><p>The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our armed forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people. Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States and they must be enforced, Smith said. "We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone."</p><p>The indictment details accusations that in two instances in 2021, Trump shared classified information with people who lacked security clearances. The indictment also confirms a CNN report on the existence of a recording in which Trump indicates understanding that he cannot declassify records after leaving office and acknowledges that he possesses a classified record.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ff/67/601cc6bf424a8d142cb521c10425/trump-classified-documents-39430.jpg"></figure><p>The investigation began after the National Archives found classified records in a batch of documents Trump returned </p> in 2022,<p> a year after leaving office. Justice Department officials then sought a subpoena demanding that he return any other classified material in his possession. </p><p>The indictment cites notes from a May 23</p> , 2022, <p>conversation between Trump and his lawyer Evan Corcoran in which the former president questioned whether he had to fully comply with the subpoena, including making the statements, "I don't want anybody looking through my boxes. I don't want you looking through my boxes," "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?" and, "Well look, isn't it better if there are no documents?"</p><p>Trumps legal team ultimately produced about three dozen additional documents and a letter stating that a diligent search had turned up nothing more. But the indictment says Trump's lawyers didn't have access to all of the records for their search. </p><p>The indictment states that between May 23 and June 2 of last year  during the window after the subpoena was issued but before Corcoran could review the documents  Trump had his personal aide Waltine "Walt" Nauta move 64 boxes out of the Mar-a-Lago storage room to Trump's residence so the former president could go through the contents, and that Nauta later returned only 30 boxes to the storage room. This was hidden from Corcoran, according to the indictment.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e0/49/16c4128d448090e5829c95f52047/aptopix-trump-classified-documents-23595.jpg"></figure><p>The Justice Department learned of the move and the possibility that classified documents remained at the estate, and gained judicial approval for a search warrant. More than <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-02/judge-unseals-detailed-inventory-of-mar-a-lago-search">100 documents with classified markings were found</a> during an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago that August. The indictment states that the recovered classified records came from the CIA, the Defense Department, the National Security Agency and the State Department, among other sources.</p><p>Nauta was indicted alongside Trump on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation, scheming to conceal and making false statements and representations.</p><p>Trump defended Nauta, a Navy veteran who was frequently by his side in the White House, in a Truth Social post before the indictment was made public.</p><p>"He has done a fantastic job! They are trying to destroy his life, like the lives of so many others, hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump,' the former president said of Nauta.</p><p>The special counsel's investigation has focused in part on Nauta, who is reportedly seen on surveillance video helping a maintenance worker move boxes from the storage room before the FBI executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>According to the indictment, Nauta made multiple false statements, including saying he was not aware the boxes had been taken to Trumps residence for review before 15 of them were sent to the National Archives, and didn't know how boxes taken to a National Archives truck had come to be in the residence; and that he falsely denied knowing where the boxes had been stored before they were found in Trumps residence, saying, I wish I could tell you. I dont know. I dont  I honestly just dont know.</p><p>Trump announced<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-08/trump-special-counsel-indictment-classified-documents"> in a social media post Thursday</a> that he had been indicted in connection with his handling of the records and had been ordered to appear in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. The indictment comes nearly a year after more than 100 documents with classified markings were found during the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The case appears to have been initially directed toward U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who handled his lawsuit last year over the FBI search. Cannons <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-12-01/appeals-court-special-master-trump-documents">decision to appoint a special master</a> to review materials seized in the search delayed the investigation for several weeks.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and claimed again late Thursday that he was innocent. On Friday he announced that he was shaking up his legal team, replacing attorneys Jim Trusty and John Rowley with New York-based Todd Blanche and a firm to be named later. Blanche is assisting with Trump's other indictment on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-03-30/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels">34 felony charges related to an alleged hush money payment</a> to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Trusty and Rowley said in a joint statement that they had resigned, calling it a logical moment to leave because the case had moved to Miami.</p><p>Trump and his allies quickly framed the new indictment as an attempt to diminish him as a political opponent, with some such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) misrepresenting the legal process.</p><p>"If the people in power can jail their political opponents at will, we dont have a republic," Hawley, a lawyer and former state attorney general, tweeted.</p><p>Such claims disregard that it was a grand jury that recommended the charges based on evidence presented to it, and that it will be a jury that decides Trump's guilt or innocence on the charges based on the evidence provided in court.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"There's a little bit of PTSD involved from that whole experience." </p><p>For much of Thursday, the air quality in Himrod was <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Himrod&amp;state=NY&amp;country=USA" target="_blank">classified as "unhealthy"</a> by the U.S. Air Quality Index</p> . Salpeter and Sweet <p>founded Sweet Farm in Half Moon Bay in northern California in 2015. But in August 2020, the sanctuary </p> was threatened by the<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-23/massive-california-firestorms-expected-to-worsen-with-more-lightning-winds">CZU Lightning Complex fire</a>, which ravaged San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. In just four hours, a team of about 45 </p>people of <p>workers and community volunteers evacuated more than 140 animals, including cows, pigs, ducks, goats</p>,<p> and a 37-year old stallion called Sturgis</p> ,<p> to two other sanctuaries out of the raging fire's path.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/30/81/16bf9cb74d10802e39c9a86a57ee/la-na-pol-dc-wildfires-animal-sanctuary-sturgis.JPG"></figure><p>The fire, which <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/16/czu-lightning-complex-including-warnella-fire/" target="_blank">destroyed 1     ,  500 properties and consumed 86,000 acres</a>, ultimately spared the farm, but the sanctuary's team found the experience difficult</p> ,<p> nonetheless. Just going through that experience was extremely traumatic, it was stressful for the animals, for the team, and everyone involved, Salpeter told The Times on Thursday.</p><p>That close call was a catalyst. After years of wildfires, droughts and other extreme climate conditions, Salpeter and Sweet decided to relocate the animal sanctuary to Himrod, a town in western New York that they determined to be climate</p>-<p> stable and also close to Sweets hometown, Penn Yan.</p><p>If it wasnt that [CZU fire] that actually burned down the farm or caused catastrophe, when would the next one happen and would that be the one that actually burns it down? Salpeter said. We wanted to [move] on our own terms, before it was an eleventh</p> -<p>hour emergency.</p><p>Climate change has influenced other Californians' migration decisions. Stanford University's Nina Berlin Rubin and Gabrielle Wong-Parodi <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9399564/" target="_blank">found in a recent study</a> of 1</p> ,<p>100 California residents that "experiencing negative outcomes during the 2020 wildfire season was associated with an increased likelihood of intending to migrate." About a third of respondents intended to move in the next </p>5 five <p>years, and nearly a quarter of those likely to move reported that wildfire and smoke </p>impacted  influenced <p>their decision at least a moderate amount.</p><p>In May 2022, after months of planning, paperwork and animal blood tests, the </p> Sweet Farm team loaded t heir <p>cows, sheep, geese, pigs, llamas and chickens  and the aging Sturgis  onto two 18-wheeler trucks to make the 47-hour, nearly 3</p> ,<p>000-mile journey to Himrod.</p>That sense of safety and serenity was disrupted this week when wildfires burning in neighbouring Canada brought a smoky haze across New York state and the rest of the East Coast region of the United States. The East Coast which has largely been spared the smog and bright red sun as a result of wildfires is now getting a taste of harsh conditions that have become all too familiar in California and the West.<p>A year later, Salpeter says he and Sweet have no regrets. The lake provides them easy access to fresh water, and the region has a wine industry, which is a reminder of their former home. They are no longer under the near-constant threat of wildfires and other extreme climate events. </p><p>But this week's harsh conditions have also provided a reminder.</p><p>"No one is immune, no one is completely unaffected by climate change, no matter where you're located," Salpeter said.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Trump's legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Times. </p><p>The former president said he has been summoned to appear in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. </p>At that appearance, he is to be formally placed under arrest by the government he once led.<p>Trump's presidential campaign issued a fundraising appeal to donors within minutes of his social media post claiming that "we are watching our Republic DIE before our very eyes."</p><p>The unprecedented decision to indict him comes after a more than yearlong investigation into whether Trump knowingly retained top-secret and other classified government records when he left office in 2021 and disregarded a subpoena to return all classified documents in his possession, and whether he and his staff obstructed FBI efforts to ensure all documents had been returned.</p><p>Presidential and other government records in the White House's possession must be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration by the day a president leaves office. Archives staff quickly questioned why some materials were not received from Trump in January 2021, prompting a months-long negotiation with the former president and his staff and resulting in the return of over 15 boxes of material in January 2022, including nearly 200 documents marked as classified.</p><p>Archives officials notified the Justice Department about the classified materials, and officials sought a subpoena demanding that Trump return any other classified material in his possession. Trump's legal team produced about three dozen additional documents and a letter stating that a diligent search had turned up nothing more.</p><p>The FBI had information indicating more classified records might be in the former president's possession and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-08-08/mar-a-lago-raided-by-fbi-agents-trump">secured a warrant to search Trump's Mar-a-Lago</a> estate last August. More than 100 additional documents <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-02/judge-unseals-detailed-inventory-of-mar-a-lago-search">labeled classified and top-secret were found.</a></p><p>Special counsel Jack Smith <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-11-18/attorney-general-garland-names-special-counsel-to-lead-trump-related-probes">was appointed in November</a> by U.S. Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland to oversee the classified documents investigation and another probe scrutinizing Trumps actions in his effort to remain in office after losing the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. </p><p>A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. It would be unusual for Smith, a tight-lipped adherent to protocol, to speak publicly before arraignment.</p><p>Federal grand juries have been meeting about the documents investigation in both Washington, D.C., and Florida, and&nbsp;it is unclear whether a second set of charges are coming as part of the inquiry. While bringing at least some of the charges in southern Florida is seen as an attempt to head off challenges over venue, it may increase the possibility that the case could land before a Trump-appointed judge.</p><p>Trump had luck in that regard early in the investigation, when he challenged the FBI search before Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed. Cannon's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-12-01/appeals-court-special-master-trump-documents">decision to appoint a special master</a> to review materials taken in the search delayed the investigation for several weeks.</p><p>Reports in recent weeks fueled speculation that an indictment was imminent. According to news reports, Trump is heard acknowledging in an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/trump-tape-classified-document-iran-milley/index.html" target="_blank">audio recording of a summer 2021 meeting</a> that he retained a classified Pentagon document after leaving office. His lawyers have reportedly been unable to find that document, which related to military planning for confronting Iran. </p><p>Other reporting indicated that Trump and his aides may have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/30/trump-mar-a-lago-surveillance-camera/" target="_blank">obstructed efforts to retrieve security camera video,</a> and that the special counsel's team has been asking witnesses about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/politics/mar-a-lago-pool-flood-suspicions-prosecutors-trump-investigation-classified-documents/index.html" target="_blank">potential damage from the flooding of a room </a>where computer servers containing video surveillance logs were stored.</p><p>Garland has adhered to precedent and not overruled Smith's charging decision.</p><p>Smith's decision adds to the mounting legal challenges Trump faces heading into the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>In March, he was indicted in New York City on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-03-30/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels">34 felony charges related to an alleged hush-money payment</a> made to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign. It marked the first time in history that a former U.S. president has been criminally prosecuted.</p><p>In addition to Smith's concurrent investigation into efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election, Fulton County, Ga. Dist. Atty. Fani Willis is leading&nbsp;a criminal probe related to Trump's alleged efforts to convince Georgia officials to change results there.</p><p>In a four-minute video posted on Truth Social, Trump called the indictment "election interference" and an extension of previous probes, including the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. </p><p>Several prominent Republicans quickly echoed his language in statements of support. </p><p>"I, and every American who believes in the rule of law, stand with President Trump against this grave injustice," House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) said in a statement. "House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable."</p><p>Those efforts appear to have already begun. Earlier this week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) demanded that the Justice Department hand over documents detailing the scope of Smiths authority and investigations.</p><p>Burbank Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who played prominent roles in both of Trump's impeachments, tweeted that Thursday's indictment was an "affirmation of the rule of law." He also derided the GOP threat to have Congress interfere in an ongoing criminal case.</p><p>"For four years, he acted like he was above the law," Schiff tweeted, referring to Trump. "But he should be treated like any other lawbreaker. And today, he has been."</p><p>The legal challenges are expected to complicate Trump's campaign. The judge presiding over his New York criminal trial has ordered Trump to be present during the proceedings, which are scheduled to start in March 2024.</p><p>Last fall, the handling of classified documents became an unexpected flashpoint ahead of the 2024 presidential campaign with the news that President Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-05/mike-pence-launches-2024-presidential-bid-in-challenge-to-trump">who joined the race on Monday</a>  had both discovered they still possessed classified records from their time in the vice president's office. Those instances stand apart from the Trump case because both men voluntarily turned the documents over to the Justice Department upon their discovery.</p><p>On June 1, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/02/politics/mike-pence-justice-department-documents/index.html" target="_blank">informed Pence it was closing its investigation</a> into his handling of classified documents without filling charges. Garland <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-01-12/atty-gen-garland-names-biden-special-counsel">appointed a special counsel in January to review Biden's handling</a> of classified documents; that investigation is ongoing.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Roberts Jr. said Congress had amended the Voting Rights Act in 1982 to ensure that Black voters were not denied an equal opportunity to "elect representatives of their choice." The voting power of Black people would be "diluted" and made meaningless if nearly all districts can be drawn to preserve white majorities, civil rights advocates said.</p><p>Six of Alabama's seven congressional districts reliably elect Republicans, although about 27% of the state's population is Black. Last year, a panel of three judges said the state could easily draw a second compact and "reasonably configured" district that a Black candidate could win.</p><p>Joining Roberts to affirm that decision were Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Ketanji Brown Jackson. </p><p>Thursday's ruling in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/" target="_blank">Allen vs. Milligan</a> could have significant political impact, particularly across the South, from Georgia and Florida to Texas. These Republican-led states have resisted drawing more voting districts that would likely result in the election of more Democrats. The court's ruling will bolster legal claims that these election maps deny fair representation for Black or Latino people.</p><p>Given how closely divided the House of Representatives currently is, the decision could even shift control of the chamber, said David Wasserman, the U.S. House expert at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. In addition to Alabama, new district lines could be drawn in Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia and lead to the "creation of 2-4 new Black-majority districts, netting [Democrats] 2-4 seats," he <a href="https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1666819545150144519">tweeted.</a></p><p>The decision also applies to election districts for state legislatures, county boards and city councils.</p><p>Voting rights advocates hailed the ruling as a major victory, not because it expanded the law but because a conservative high court voted to preserve it.</p><p>Alabama Republicans had argued it was unconstitutional to draw new districts along racial lines. </p><p>The National Redistricting Foundation, an affiliate of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, called the decision a "massive win for voting and for voters across the country. Black voters in Alabama have long been denied fair representation  and todays Supreme Court decision in favor of voters marks a landmark moment to move the needle in the right direction," said Marina Jenkins, the group's executive director. </p><p>The decision came as a surprise in part because Roberts has been a longtime critic of the Voting Rights Act. </p><p>As a young lawyer in the Reagan administration, he opposed the 1982 amendments on the grounds that they would lead to "proportional representation" based on race. </p><p>He also led the court 10 years ago in overturning a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that had required Alaska, Arizona, seven Southern states and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/jurisdictions-previously-covered-section-5">certain other jurisdictions</a> to obtain clearance from Washington before making changes in voting rules or election laws. In a 5-4 decision in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-96" target="_blank">Shelby County vs. Holder,</a> Roberts said this special burden was no longer justified. </p><p>In Thursday's ruling, he said the court was not seeking to change the law but to maintain it. He said "a faithful application of our precedents and a fair reading of the record before us" shows that Alabama must draw an extra district that could elect a Black candidate. </p><p>Since the 1980s, he said, the court has held that states must draw one or more districts that favor Black or Latino candidates when certain conditions are met. Those conditions include whether there are enough Black or Latino people to make up a voting district that would be "compact" and "reasonably configured." Another factor is whether voting is "racially polarized." Lawyers said that in Alabama, no Black candidate had a chance of winning in a white-majority district. </p><p>Last year, the three-judge panel applied those standards and ruled that the state must redraw its map to create a second compact, near-majority Black district. The judges, including two appointed by former President Trump, said the Voting Rights Act required giving Black voters a meaningful opportunity to elect a representative of their choice. </p><p>But last year, in a preliminary win for the GOP, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-07/supreme-court-blocks-new-black-majority-district-in-alabama">Supreme Court blocked that decision</a> from taking effect. </p><p>Then, Kavanaugh voted with four other conservative justices to block the creation of the new district.</p><p>But the court agreed to review the case and hear arguments on the law. Kavanaugh then cast a deciding vote to join Roberts and the court's three liberals to affirm the lower-court ruling.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It's an office building, with a hard-to-find entrance and no church to tend those in need.</p><p>It was here that about a dozen Latin American asylum seekers were dumped </p> on last<p> Friday by the state of Florida. Days later, </p>another<p> 20 </p> more <p>migrants arrived</p>,<p> courtesy of the Sunshine State.</p><p>Florida authorities have called it a "voluntary relocation," suggesting the deportees  powerless, impoverished  were a party to their transcontinental evacuation and unceremonious delivery. </p><p>In fact, it's just the latest human sacrifice on the altar of political ambition by Florida's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-05-24/florida-ron-desantis-announces-bid-for-2024-presidency">White House-seeking governor,</a> Ron DeSantis.</p><p>His supine state Legislature, which makes virtually every </p> wish of<p> DeSantis' </p>wish<p> its command, has allotted $24 million to ship migrants  even those outside </p>of<p> Florida  from the southern </p> U.S. <p>border to other, mostly Democratic, states. </p><p>Take that, woke lefties!</p><p>Columnists Anita Chabria and Mark Z. Barabak discuss the political stunt and the scorpions-in-a-bottle relationship between DeSantis and California's Gov. Gavin Newsom, who wishes he could run for president.</p><p><b>Chabria:</b> When I look at these flights, I can't get past that DeSantis will be in Sacramento later this month for a $3,300-per-muffin fund</p>-<p>raising breakfast.</p><p>These flights made headlines  no amount of paid media could match the national</p> <p>attention. My cynical side wonders </p> whether if<p> this is all just publicity seeking </p> by for<p> a presidential contender. Could it be that simple, if vile?</p><p><b>Barabak:</b> Yes, it could be.</p><p>Let your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free serve as a political advance team. Whip out those checkbooks, folks</p>, :<p> Ron</p>cq<p> DeSantis is coming to town!</p><p>His nascent White House bid <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-05-25/desantis-president-announcement-untested-candidate-national-campaign">hasn't gone nearly as well </a>as the advance hype promised. </p><p>The formal announcement was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-05-24/desantis-twitter-problem-too-online">a glitchy embarrassment.</a> (That'll teach him to outsource technical support to Elon Musk's chewing-gum-and-baling-wire version of Twitter.) </p><p>DeSantis still seems to be working on connecting with voters, a crucial part of running for president, which all the doting in the world from Florida's ambition-oozing first lady can't help.</p><p>So apparently he's chosen to fire up the old outrage machine, and what better way to get folks riled up than stoking the trusty immigration issue?</p><p>Do you think, Anita, it was coincidence that Florida played door</p>-<p>bell ditch on Newsom's front </p>-<p>porch rather than, say, flying its victims to Maryland or Louisiana, which also have Democratic governors?</p><p><b>Chabria: </b>I do not.</p><p>There's no end of hostility between Newsom and DeSantis. They've beefed about hair gel and Disneyland. They've skirmished over guns, abortion, LGBTQ+ rights and education. Newsom took a family vacation through the South and tweaked Florida's governor in his neck of the woods.</p><p>Now DeSantis is returning the favor. </p><p>But let's not pretend our own governor wasn't thrilled to respond to this latest provocation. While it's true Newsom's White House ambitions have been caged by </p> President <p>Biden's decision to run again, they remain alive and kicking. </p><p>Our geriatric president tripping over a sandbag last week at the Air Force Academy commencement in Colorado was just the latest reminder of his advanced age and the worry that causes in Democratic circles. No doubt Newsom isn't the only one who wonders if there are more sandbags on the 80-year-old Biden's road ahead. </p><p>Meantime, he can thank DeSantis for putting the national spotlight, for the moment, on something other than California's homeless crisis. </p><p>But Newsom aside, immigration is a vital issue that we </p>have<p> as a country have failed to handle policywise, leading to incalculable human suffering. Even under </p> President <p>Obama, we separated families. </p><p>So in that sense, do you think DeSantis has a point? Can the Democrats really claim a high ground on the issue?</p><p><b>Barabak:</b> Obama, as you note, angered many with his approach to immigration. Critics branded him </p> the<p> "deporter </p>-<p>in </p>-<p>chief" because of the millions booted from the country during his eight years in office.</p><p>Biden, for his part, has been attacked for being too lax on border enforcement and too harsh in his administration's treatment of immigrants.</p><p>Yes, as you said, our immigration system is a mess and generations of politicians have ignored the problem or, worse, exploited it for their own selfish ends.</p><p>I think we can agree, though, that shamelessly exploiting people for political gain  moving them around the country like cargo, dropping them on the sidewalk like a used candy wrapper  is a whole other order of cruelty and callous irresponsibility.</p><p>None of this takes place in a political vacuum. But as we game out the electoral implications, let's not forget these are flesh-and-blood human beings who, at possibly the most fearful and vulnerable moment in their lives, are being terribly exploited.</p><p>There but for the grace.</p><p><b>Chabria:</b> My father arrived on a boat as a refugee, so you'll get no argument from me. </p><p>It's important that our attorney general, Rob Bonta, is investigating</p> <p>whether the flights were a</p>ny<p> form of human trafficking  or kidnapping, as our governor tweeted in a moment of high hyperbole. These are people blatantly being used for campaign purposes and deserve the full protection and respect of our laws. </p><p>Of course, Bonta is </p> likely <p>running for governor </p> (he's hinted at it but hasn't announced)<p> and doesn't mind the big splash of attention  just more proof you can't separate politics from policy or cameras from campaigns. </p><p><b>Barabak:</b> I'm not a lawyer, and I won't try to play one in the newspaper. But I think the chances of anyone going to jail for pulling this stunt </p> are is<p> as likely as DeSantis and Newsom running together in 2024 on a unity ticket.</p><p>"Tweeting is not policy" was the explanation given when our itchy-fingered governor blustered a hollow threat against Walgreens in a fight over abortion access. </p><p>It's also not a prosecutor's brief.</p><p>Maybe we need a law requiring a 48-hour waiting period before Newsom tweets.</p><p><b>Chabria:</b> I will say this for California  having leaders standing up to the bigotry and bias that DeSantis and others are spewing is vital</p> .<p> It gives confidence to those here that their rights will be protected.</p><p>Whether Newsom and, to a lesser degree, Bonta have political motivations or a sound legal argument, they are speaking loudly for the values of this state. </p><p>As a fan of </p> D<p>ark Brandon, Biden's aviator-sporting alter ego, I think there's something to be said for punching back. </p><p>But these "voluntary relocations" are going to continue, aren't they</p> ?, B<p>ecause they serve their purpose so well</p> .?<p> Here we all are, talking about it. </p><p><b>Barabak:</b> I've said before and will repeat: There's no organism on Earth more sensitive to heat and light than a politician.</p><p>As long as candidates like DeSantis believe there's an advantage to be had in performative political acts like migrant </p>-<p>dumping  heartless as they may be  th</p> e<p>se sort</p> s<p> of ploys will continue.</p><p>But let's not allow voters off the hook. </p><p>Until and unless they convince lawmakers they need to address the immigration issue in a meaningful way  which means legislation and compromise on all sides or seriously risk losing office, they'll keep doing nothing.</p><p>In the meantime, to quote a sage political observer, Bob Dylan, I pity the poor immigrant.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Around half of the $80 billion would have gone toward increasing tax compliance among Americans with incomes over $400,000 a year, with the rest of the money earmarked for improving the agencys taxpayer services and modernizing its archaic technologies. California, which has more millionaire households and more billionaires than any other state and <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4093/ca-geography-wealth-090519.pdf">holds 17% of the nations wealth</a> despite having only 12% of its population, was due to face an outsize share of the new enforcement actions.</p><p>These cuts are great news for wealthy tax evaders and bad news for the rest of us, Vanessa Williamson, a senior fellow at Brookings, a public policy think tank in Washington, wrote in an email.</p><p>The IRS funding cuts will likely shrink government revenues by $2.3 billion over the next 10 years, triggering a $900-million surge in the federal deficit, according to <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf">a report</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p><p>That money will instead stay in rich Americans pockets. Without adequate enforcement funding, government officials struggle to collect taxes from the super-rich, explained Joe Hughes, federal policy analyst for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Many wealthy households filings are complicated, and auditors have to navigate enormously complex business entities with hundreds or thousands of subentities.</p><p>Thats a jigsaw thats really hard for an IRS agent to put together, Hughes said.</p><p>Some experts argue that spending more money poring over wealthy Americans taxes is a waste of energy.</p><p>High-earning taxpayers are more likely to receive expert tax advice, and thus less likely to make errors, Chris Edwards, a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote in <a href="https://www.cato.org/testimony/irs-funding">congressional testimony</a> that urged lawmakers to not spend so much money on additional tax enforcement as part of the debt ceiling deal. More aggressive IRS enforcement would increase taxpayer costs, as they would invest more time and energy defending themselves.</p><p>Americans already spend some $14.4 billion per year on tax-preparation services alone, according to <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/tax-preparation-services-united-states/">one recent estimate</a>.</p><p>But the fight to collect the taxes that the richest Americans owe is especially fierce in California, a hot spot for what author and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-stop-wealthy-hiding-money-chuck-collins-oscar-mayer-2021-3">Oscar Mayer heir</a> Chuck Collins calls the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/celebrities-la-mansion-tax-homelessness-affordable-housing">wealth defense industry</a>, the complex of law, accounting and money management firms that work to ensure that the richest Americans stay that way. The government is completely outgunned, argues Collins, who <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/24/its-time-for-a-100percent-tax-on-billionaire-estates-oscar-mayer-heir-says.html">gave away his fortune at 26</a> and is now a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington.</p><p>Heirs of J. Paul Getty, the oilman who assembled one of Californias most famous fortunes, maneuvered their wealth in an effort to limit the amount of taxes they paid, the New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/23/the-getty-familys-trust-issues">reported in January</a>. Kendalle and Sarah Getty, according to the magazine, made an effort to convince tax collectors that they did not live in or conduct business in the Golden State to avoid state taxes. The Getty trusts were established in California, but Kendalle and Sarahs trust moved to Nevada. Robert Leberman, an administrator for the Gettys trust, told the magazine at the time of publication that the family intended to fulfill any and all tax obligations.</p><p>Californias tax collection service, the Franchise Tax Board, lacks the expertise to keep up with to that sort of innovation in the industry, Collins said. A fully funded IRS is necessary for that, he said.</p><p>California has a tax base that is incredibly volatile, so we are at the mercy of high-wealth individuals, said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of Los Angeles, a Democrat who voted against the presidents deal with Republicans. And now, on top of that, were coupling that with crippling the federal governments ability to go after them to just make sure that theyre paying what they owe.</p><p>Republicans, however, have vowed to go further in cutting the agencys funding.</p><p>Were not going to stop until we get the rest of the IRS agents repealed, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) told reporters in a triumphant speech after the House passed the bill partially repealing the new funding. I promise you, Ill be back next year and next year and next year. Because I believe government should be here to help you  not go after you.</p><p>Now the tax-collecting agency has been thrust into a state of uncertainty. In the immediate term, the bill rescinded $1.4 billion already granted to the agency; it also asks lawmakers to divert $20 billion to other nondefense spending programs over the next two years. Supporters of IRS funding hikes say Democrats should fight to keep the dollars alive, especially because the agency has only recently emerged from a decade of devastating cuts. The IRS budget fell by $2 billion from 2010 to 2017, a loss that in turn reduced government revenue by tens of billions of dollars, according to an estimate by <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted">ProPublica</a>.</p><p>Without clear indicators of where its funding stands, the IRS is left with little impetus to kick off a crackdown, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. After all, next years funding is uncertain  especially given that Republicans have made it a priority to continue pushing for additional cuts. That uncertainty is heightened by the fact that cuts have come less than a year after the original $80 billion was given to the agency, she added.</p><p>Nine months later, youre already seeing a 27% reduction from that $80-billion funding, Holtzblatt said. Is there any guarantee that Congress wont come back again and cut the funding? ... From a managerial perspective, that kind of uncertainty may curb enthusiasm for hiring additional staff and for making investments in technology.</p><p>The fate of the IRS will ultimately be tied to the fate of Democrats ability to control Congress. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) said that if his party manages to take back the House in 2024, the tone of negotiations over government spending could shift, with IRS funding expansions back on the table.</p><p>Schiff has his own suspicion  that as the IRS takes on the ultra-wealthy, the ultra-wealthy are taking on the IRS. In America, tax avoidance is a bipartisan pastime. But Schiff claimed that Republicans in particular are at the mercy of ultra-wealthy donors, and that those donors dont want to be audited.</p><p>If you defund the IRS, like Republicans are trying to do, it helps their wealthy and corporate donors all over the country, Schiff said. And thats really what theyre all about.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The law would also bar federal immigration authorities or other entities connected to immigration enforcement from accessing city databases or anyones personal data.</p><p>City Council members Bob Blumenfield and John Lee were absent from Friday's vote.</p><p>L.A.'s proposal, referred to the council as a "sanctuary city" law, would essentially codify existing policies, including a <a href="https://lacity.gov/sites/g/files/wph2121/files/2021-04/garcetti_ed20.pdf" target="_blank">2017 executive directive</a> issued by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti. </p><p>If passed, the law would be similar to one in San Francisco. That law prohibits city employees from using city funds or resources to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, officers in the enforcement of federal immigration laws unless such assistance is required by federal or state law.</p><p>The council on Friday also asked for a report back that details any "current gaps" between LAPD Special Order No. 40, a department policy that prohibits police officers from initiating contact with anyone for the sole purpose of learning their immigration status, and Garcetti's 2017 directive. The council also asked for a report on instances when city departments have assisted ICE.</p><p>Those reports are intended to answer outstanding questions about the city's existing policies. </p><p>The motion voted on Friday by the council says that policies allow ICE officers to access city jails to interrogate people in LAPD custody. The motion also states that LAPD officers are permitted to transfer individuals to ICE custody, even when judicial warrants are not issued.</p><p>On Friday, however, the LAPD disputed such claims. </p><p>LAPD Capt. Anthony Otero, assistant commanding officer of the department's Custody Services Division, said the LAPD doesn't allow ICE to enter LAPD jails to interrogate people.

The indiscriminate violence was dubbed the Zoot Suit Riots, named for the baggy suits popular among the young people at the time.</p><p>The city of L.A. can finally take responsibility and apologize for its role effectively sanctioning the violence perpetuated eight decades ago, said Councilmember Kevin de Len, who introduced a council <a href="http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2023/23-0004_misc_5-17-23.pdf" target="_blank">resolution</a> last month condemning the riots. </p><p>The council celebrated the historic apology this Friday with zoot suit-clad dancers and remarks from De Len and community leaders, who praised the apology as a necessary step in highlighting the role city played in the weeklong riots. </p><p>"You had young boys  as young as 12 years of age  who were violently beaten, they were stripped of their clothes," De Len said. "Acts that exposed deep-seated racism that targeted Latinos. And just as disgraceful, back in the day, were the actions of our Police Department, the LAPD, and the City Council." </p><p>As De Len started his remarks, a few people in the back heckled him, calling him a racist. Others urged them to show respect. </p><p>In the first week of June 1943, minority youths were beaten, harassed and their clothing was ripped off in the streets, according to reports from the time. Some were urinated on in public, De Len said. </p><p>I remember my mother distinctly telling me when I was a kid how angry and upset she was watching young Mexican kids running down the street naked from having their suit ripped off, said Miguel Lopez with the Chicano Moratorium Committee, who was flanked in the front of council chamber by a few dozen people dressed in Pachuco style.</p><p>As the speakers stood at the front of council chambers, black and white historical images, old newspaper clippings and recent footage of lowriders cruising over the 6th Street Viaduct flashed on two TV screens above the council horseshoe. The newspaper clipping highlighted the support outlets at the time, namely The Times, gave to the cause of the white mobs rather than the victims. Zoot suiters learn lesson in fights with servicemen, read one such headline. </p><p>Manny Alcaraz, described as a Pachuco culture enthusiast, said he hoped the city's apology would inform young generations both about the riots and the long list of famous Zoot Suiters who wore the attire the Los Angeles City Council had tried to ban: Cesar Chavez, Cab Calloway and Malcolm X, to name a few.</p><p>"This week, tonight, the Zoot Suit Riots were ongoing," he said. "This is what I want the younger generation to know.</p><p>Racial tensions at the time had been heightened by the now notorious <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-zoot-suit-riots-anniversary-20180604-story.html">Sleepy Lagoon murder trial</a>. After a young Latino man was killed in Southeast L.A., 300 suspects were rounded up, most of them Latino. Twenty-two boys were charged, fueling anti-Mexican sentiment.</p><p>Through the resolution, the city formally apologized for wielding their power to outlaw the </p>wide pegged  white-legged<p> trousers and billowy coats rather than cracking down on the white mobs perpetrating the violence. </p><p>The Los Angeles City Council and the City of Los Angeles must apologize for responding to these racialized attacks by attempting to pass an ordinance to ban wearing Zoot Suits rather than seeking to protect the community who was directly targeted by this brutal multi-day assault, the resolution said.</p><p>The celebration come on the heels of a similar <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/los-angeles-county-denounces-dark-chapter-of-zoot-suit-riots-80-years-later">apology</a> by Los Angeles County. Last month, the county voted unanimously to condemn the attacks and vowed to fight racial discrimination. </p>Times staff writer Julia Wick contributed to this report.                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He later added at a joint news conference that the agreement will help both nations adapt and upgrade our partnership to ensure our countries remain on the cutting edge of a rapidly changing world.</p><p>As part of the declaration announced Thursday, the two sides will kick off negotiations on the use of minerals from the U.K. that are critical in the production of electric vehicles that are eligible for U.S. tax credits. The administration has also opened talks with the European Union and forged a deal with Japan that allow certain critical raw materials for EVs to be treated as if they were sourced in the United States.</p><p>Allies have raised concerns about incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act favoring the North American auto industry. The legislation  one of Biden's key policy victories  invests some $375 billion to transition the United States to cleaner cars and energy sources.</p><p>Biden and Sunak have already had four </p>face-to-face <p>meetings since Sunak became prime minister in October, but the talks in Washington offered the two leaders a chance for their most sustained interaction to date.</p> U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes surprise trip to Kyiv, boosts air defenses<p>Sunak reflected on the significant conversations their respective predecessors have had over the years in the Oval Office and acknowledged that he and Biden were facing their own daunting moment. The visit to Washington is Sunaks first since becoming Britains prime minister in October.</p><p>Our economies are seeing perhaps the biggest transformation since the Industrial Revolution as new technologies provide incredible opportunities, but also give our adversaries more tools, Sunak said.</p><p>The 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine was high on the agenda. The U.S. and U.K. are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. </p><p>Biden reiterated confidence that Congress would continue to provide Ukraine funding as needed despite some hesitation among Republican leaders at the growing cost of the war for American taxpayers.</p><p>The U.S. and the U.K. have stood together to support Ukraine, Biden said at the start of their meeting. </p><p>Sunak also made the case to Biden for U.K. Defense Minister Ben Wallace to succeed departing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to end his term leading the 31-member alliance in September. Stoltenberg is slated to meet with Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are set to gather in Lithuania on July 11-12 for their annual summit.</p> Ukraine is counting on its spring offensive against Russia. Biden has a stake in it too<p>Asked if it was time for a U.K. leader for NATO, Biden said it may be" but that remains to be seen. </p><p>Were going to have to get a consensus within NATO, he said.</p><p>Biden also reflected that the two countries have worked through some of the toughest moments in modern history side by side, recalling the meetings that Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt held in the White House.</p><p>You know Prime Minister Churchill and Roosevelt met here a little over 70 years ago and they asserted that the strength of the partnership between Great Britain and the United States was the strength of the free world," Biden told Sunak. I still think theres truth to that assertion.</p><p>Sunak is keen to make the U.K. a key player in artificial intelligence, and announced that his government will gather politicians, scientists and tech executives for a summit on AI safety in the fall.</p><p>He said it was vital to ensure that paradigm-shifting new technologies are harnessed for the good of humanity.</p><p>No one country can do this alone," Sunak said Wednesday. This is going to take a global effort.</p> Britain's voters warm to new leader Rishi Sunak  but not to his fractious party<p>Biden said the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-16/uk-inflation-41-year-high-11-1-percent">challenges</a> that come with the advancement of AI technology are staggering.</p><p>It is a limitless capacity and possibility, but we have to do it with great care, said Biden, who added that he welcomed the U.K.'s leadership on the issue.</p><p>Sunak's visit comes as U.S. and British intelligence officials are still trying to sort out blame for the breaching of a major dam in southern Ukraine, which sent floodwaters gushing through towns and over farmland. Neither Washington nor London has officially accused Russia of blowing up the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam.</p><p>Sunak said Wednesday that U.K. intelligence services are still assessing the evidence, but if it does prove to be intentional, it will represent a new low ... an appalling barbarism on Russias part.</p><p>Russia throughout this war has used as a deliberate active strategy to target civilian infrastructure, he told broadcaster ITV in Washington.</p><p>The two sides looked to demonstrate that the U.S.-U.K. relationship remains as strong as ever despite recent political and economic upheaval in the U.K. Sunak is one of three British prime ministers Biden has dealt with since taking office in 2021, and the administrations have had differences over Brexit and its impact on Northern Ireland.</p><p>Nonetheless, there's a sense in the Biden administration that the U.S.-U.K. relationship is back on more stable footing after the sometimes choppy tenure of Boris Johnson and the 45-day premiership of Liz Truss.</p> Rishi Sunak becomes Britain's 3rd leader in 2 months, inheriting a host of challenges<p>I think theres a sense of relief to some degree, not just in the White House, but throughout Washington, that the Sunak government has been very pragmatic and maintained the U.K.s robust commitment to Ukraine and to increasing defense spending, said Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He added that with Sunak, there has also been somewhat of a return to pragmatism on economic issues and relations with the European Union post-Brexit.</p><p>Sunak at the news conference sought to hammer home that the U.K. remains as reliable an ally as ever."</p><p>"I know some people have wondered what kind of partner Britain would be after we left the EU," Sunak said. "Id say judge us by our actions."</p><p>Biden invited Sunak to stay at Blair House, the official presidential guest residence on Lafayette Square. Before the U.S. government purchased Blair House in 1942, foreign leaders visiting the president often stayed at the White House.</p><p>In a lighter moment, the president began telling the story of how in the pre-Blair House days Churchill <a href="https://blairhouse.org/history">wandered toward the president's family quarters</a> in the wee hours to rouse the sleeping Roosevelt for conversation. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was said to have cut off Churchill before he could make it to the president.</p><p>"Don't worry," Sunak interjected. You wont see me bothering you and the first lady.</p>Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Defend families. Save the children. <p>Parents shouted slogans like these in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">Glendale</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/parents-protest-lgbtq-pride-day-los-angeles-saticoy-elementary-school">North Hollywood</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/gov-newsom-reprimands-school-board-president-for-calling-harvey-milk-a-pedophile">Temecula</a> and even on the steps of the state Capitol in recent days, fervid in a hate that many in California thought was a thing of the past. </p><p>But as Sister Roma, she of the much-maligned <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-22/dodgers-apologize-invite-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-pride-night">Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence</a>, told me when we sat down for a few minutes Monday, it's not really the parents who are fomenting the hate  and everything old is new again anyway. Leg warmers, for example, are back. </p><p>"They are clinging with white-knuckle fear to the last bit of power they have," Roma said</p> <p>of the far-right agitators, just as ultra-conservatives did the last time California tried to clear its schools of anything hinting at gender diversity. </p><p>More than 75 laws outlawing a range of gender-related issues  from talking about sexuality in classrooms to holding drag performances in public  have been passed by statehouses nationwide this year. Republican standard-bearers including Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Green</p> e<p> have made anti-LGBTQ+ hate their brand, and there is real concern that our current Supreme Court will overturn <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-gay-marriage-decision-20150626-story.html">Obergefell vs. Hodges</a>, the landmark 2015 case that legalized same sex-marriage nationwide. </p><p>Hard to believe it's 2023, especially because California has been here, done this, circa 1978 with the Briggs Initiative, also known as Proposition 6. That's when voters considered giving school boards the power to fire gay and lesbian teachers and anyone who openly supported gay rights. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative, named for then-State Sen. John Briggs, a conservative from Orange County, also pitted LBGTQ+ rights against parental rights. The initiative posited</p> <p>that allowing gay and lesbian teachers in classrooms was a danger to kids, because such educators would "recruit" students into their "lifestyles." </p><p>"I don't understand why we have to send our children to sit in front of a homosexual teacher for eight hours," this newspaper reported Briggs saying in July 1977. "We can't risk our children."</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>"Save the children" is nothing new  just a recycled attack, dusted off and freshened up for another generation and supercharged <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-07/how-qanon-has-hijacked-hollywood-movies-for-conspiracy-theories">through the QAnon conduit of social media</a> to serve the purposes of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-25/california-takes-lead-on-hate">far-right intent on undermining democracy</a> and maintaining the shaky status quo of power. Remember when we were supposed to be saving the children from the adrenochrome-drinking Democrats ritually abusing them</p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/02/16/pizzagate-qanon-capitol-attack/" target="_blank">underneath a D.C. pizza parlo</a>r?</p><p>If those who oppose diversity can't outright try to ban the humans this time, they will ban the ideas, purposefully riling up supporters by conflating inclusion with indoctrination, and "grooming" with existing. Because really, who doesn't want to save the children if the threat feels real?</p><p>Just like now, the whole Briggs mess back then emanated from</p> <p>Florida  specifically in Dade County where Anita Bryant, a pop singer better known for her role as the spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, in 1977 spearheaded a "Save the Children" campaign to repeal a law that protected gay and lesbian people from job and housing discrimination. She successfully argued that she had a right to control "the moral atmosphere in which my children grow up."</p><p>Her campaign was a backlash to a decade of expanding recognition of gay civil rights after the Stonewall riots in 1969. It sparked a national movement that Briggs picked up on, with Bryant's help. </p><p>While Bryant's campaign was successful, it fueled a fierce response from California's LGBTQ+ community. On the night Bryant's ordinance passed in Florida, politician Harvey Milk, then a young member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led a protest of thousands down Castro Street. </p><p>After the Briggs Initiative made it onto the California ballot, collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures, Milk was among its most vocal critics. In a memorable speech on the steps of San Francisco's City Hall, he spoke of the need to keep California a place of hope and acceptance. </p><p>"(T)he young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, and the Richmond, Minnesotas, who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope," Milk said. "And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right."</p><p>That's the Harvey Milk whose legacy was recently debased by board members in the Temecula Valley Unified School District, where a conservative majority refused to adopt a new social studies curriculum because Milk was mentioned in a few pages of history materials. That is what erasure means: not allowing future generations to believe in hope for the oppressed, making them feel alone and wrong. </p><p>Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Atty. Gen. </p>eral <p>Rob Bonta announced </p> that <p>they are investigating Temecula's action as a possible violation of state law. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative was ultimately defeated by more than a million votes, despite initial polling that predicted easy passage. The tipping point was when former Gov. Ronald Reagan came out against it, along with then-Gov. Jerry Brown and then-President </p>Jimmy<p> Carter.</p><p>Which brings me to Monday and Sister Roma at the Capitol. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/18/5a/76043a0a4908926752432fdee4ed/unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>I met Roma in a room full of queer leaders at a reception for Pride Month at the Capitol, where 16 LGBTQ+ activists were honored by the Senate and Assembly. Also in the room were the LGBTQ+ powerhouses of the Legislature, where more than 10% of elected officials now identify as something other than heterosexual. </p><p>It was a room you would not find in Kansas, Florida, Nebraska  or anywhere in 1978. Along with Sister Roma, resplendent in a royal blue feather headdress, those honored included tennis legends Billie Jean King and Rosemary Casals; Phil Collum, the first openly gay assistant chief of police in Chula Vista; Janessa Goldbeck, a former Marine captain running for office in San Diego, and others you perhaps have never heard of, but who are engaged in lives of service to help make this state a better place. </p><p>The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have given more than $887,000 to charities since 2000, including the St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church Fund an Immigrant Program, AIDS Housing Alliance / SF and the Bay Area Rainbow Symphony. That's</p> <p>a bit more than the $1,500 they raised at their first fundraiser in 1980 for gay Cuban refugees. The Sisters have come a long way, but never strayed from their mission: to promulgate universal joy and expiate stigmatic guilt.</p><p>"I've never come from a place of hate," said Sister Roma, whose blue eyes are kind and unflinching. </p><p>"It actually hurts" that people believe she's ridiculing anything, she told me. But "visibility without fear encourages others," and so she and her sisters will continue to do what they do. </p><p>Each of the honorees walked down the center aisles of the Senate and Assembly to receive gilt-framed resolutions honoring their work. Republicans walked out of the chamber</p> <p>both times Sister Roma received her commendation. And a few hundred protesters gathered outside, allegedly upset by the "mockery" that Sister Roma and her order represent to the Catholic Church, which, let's remember,</p> <p>is facing bankruptcies across California as the financial toll of sexual abuse lawsuits mount</p> s<p>. </p><p>But as Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), the first gay woman to hold her post, told me at the reception, there has been a "sea change" in who holds power in California and there will be no going back to 1978. </p><p>"This comes down to freedom," Atkins said. Not just protecting it, but advancing it. </p><p>Earlier in the day, on the same steps where the protest against Sister Roma took place, LGBTQ+ legislators announced they are pursuing a state constitutional amendment for the 2024 ballot that would repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California. Yes, it is still in California's Constitution despite being overturned by courts. It reads: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.</p><p>If the U.S. Supreme Court does overturn the federal right to same-sex marriage, having that nullified proposition on the books could be a problem in California. So as state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), one of the authors of the amendment, put it, "we need to be on the offensive." </p><p>Which brings to mind another quote from Milk. </p><p>"Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders," he said, "and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible."</p><p>With activists like Sister Roma and elected officials like Atkins and Wiener in office across the state, we are on the offensive. For all the hate that is out there, churned from the basest of motives and used to exploit parents, this is not Florida and it is not 1978. </p><p>In California, visibility and equality may not be perfect. But unlike leg warmers, closets are never coming back. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Ron DeSantis on Wednesday defended his states decision to fly migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border to California, arguing that the state had essentially invited the migrants with its welcoming policies toward immigrants.</p><p>DeSantis, a Republican presidential candidate, spoke at a meeting with sheriffs near Arizonas border with Mexico, pledging to get control of the border and taking a hard line on a signature issue for former President Trump, a rival for the 2024 nomination.</p><p>I think the border should be closed. I dont think we should have any of this, DeSantis said. But if theres a policy to have an open border, then I think the sanctuary jurisdictions should be the ones that have to bear that.</p> California AG says DeSantis' 'fingerprints' are on flights bringing migrants to Sacramento<p>DeSantis administration said this week that the three dozen migrants whom the state recently sent from El Paso to Sacramento at taxpayer expense all went willingly, disputing allegations that the individuals were coerced to travel under false pretenses. California officials are investigating whether any violations of criminal or civil law occurred.</p><p>For DeSantis, the focus on immigration is a chance to boost his credibility on a top issue for GOP primary voters.</p><p>He sees political upside in picking a high-profile fight with liberal California and its Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who has become a bogeyman for many on the right.</p><p>Its also an opportunity for DeSantis to confront an issue that has been central to the appeal of Trump, who promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. By the end of his administration, the wall had not been finished and U.S. taxpayers were on the hook for the billions of dollars it cost.</p><p>This is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-03/california-investigating-who-sent-16-migrants-from-texas-to-doorstep-of-sacramento-diocese">not the first time</a> DeSantis has chartered planes to transfer migrants across the country. Last fall, Florida flew 49 Venezuelans to the upscale Massachusetts island of Marthas Vineyard.</p> Florida says it's responsible for transporting migrants to Sacramento<p>California declared itself a sanctuary for immigrants after Trump was elected president, extending protections to people living in the country illegally and allowing them to apply for some state benefits. DeSantis said those policies serve as a magnet for people looking for a better life and make it harder to crack down on illegal immigration.</p><p>The sanctuary jurisdictions are part of the reason we have this problem because they have endorsed and agitated for these types of open border policies, DeSantis said.</p><p>DeSantis did not respond to Newsom, who raised the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-05/newsom-desantis-migrant-flights-kidnapping-charges">possibility</a> of kidnapping charges and called DeSantis a small, pathetic man.</p><p>Immigration is a national problem that border states shouldnt have to shoulder on their own, DeSantis said, adding that the federal government should give states more authority to enforce immigration law on their own. Beyond the migrant flights, he touted Floridas other efforts to confront illegal immigration beyond its borders, including sending National Guard soldiers and state law enforcement officers to Texas and interdicting migrant boats off Floridas coast.</p><p>DeSantis alleged that Florida taxpayers are on board with his use of state funds to move migrants from Texas to California, saying it was an issue in the campaign in which he was overwhelmingly reelected last year. DeSantis in May signed a law allocating $12 million that can be used for migrant flights.</p> Sacramento embraces surprise arrival of migrants stuck in national political feud<p>Two weeks after kicking off his presidential campaign, DeSantis is in a distant second place behind Trump. He did not mention his rival by name, taking aim instead at President Bidens border policies, which he blamed for the proliferation of drugs.</p><p>The Florida governor met with sheriffs from around the country at a community college in the southeastern Arizona town of Sierra Vista, a conservative enclave thats home to many Border Patrol officers and sits next to the Ft. Huachuca Army base. Later, his aides said he planned to visit the border but did not allow journalists to come.</p><p>Trumps super PAC noted that DeSantis praised his rivals immigration policies on <a href="https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis/status/1416539835393794048">Twitter</a> two years ago and pointed to the former presidents own immigration plans.

      <title>Will conservative Catholics decry Florida's Sacramento migrant dump?</title>
      <link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-07/migrant-flights-ron-desantis-catholic-church</link>
      <description>Tellingly, the three main architects of Florida’s migrant-shipping strategy have ties to the Catholic Church, including Gov. DeSantis. Meanwhile, Catholics who actually read the Bible have stepped up to help the migrants stranded in Sacramento.</description>

Conservative Catholic activists are marking off the days like a homophobic Advent calendar.</p><p>Theyre the ones who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/story/2023-05-19/dodgers-disgrace-history-by-removing-sisters-pride-night">originally pressured the Blue Crew to rescind the honor</a> from the Sisters, </p> a charity group male drag troupe <p>whose members dress in ornate habits to ridicule religious zealotry, yet who also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2023-05-25/the-sisters-of-perpetual-indulgence-are-on-a-mission-to-spread-universal-joy-despite-the-dodgers-drama">do the good work that nuns do</a>. The Dodgers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-22/dodgers-apologize-invite-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-pride-night">re-invited the Sisters after a public outcry</a>, causing the conservatives to call for a protest of Pride Night and a boycott of the Dodgers. </p>Made change b/c I just learned that not all the Sisters identify as male and they are a charity group that dresses in drag as nuns and not a troupe./ AJ<p>The boycott will be about as successful as the San Diego Padres this season. But that hasnt stopped bishops from California to Texas, Wisconsin to Nebraska from lining up to take their swings at the team and the Sisters. Typical of this Boo Crew is Robert Barron, bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester in Minnesota, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bishops-ordained-20150908-story.html">a former auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles</a> and founder of Word on Fire, a multi</p>-<p>million</p> -<p>dollar ministry that has made him <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-barron-christmas-power-20171225-story.html">one of the most prominent Catholic voices in the country</a>.</p><p>On a Twitter video posted May 25, he slammed the Sisters as an anti-Catholic hate group, ridiculed the Dodgers pathetic apology to them and said anti-Catholicism was the last acceptable prejudice in America. He then made a direct appeal to my Hispanic friends, arguing that they should be especially offended.</p><p>This is the religion of your family, Barron said. Of your </p>abuela<p> and </p>abuelo<p>, of your </p>familia<p>, of your </p>tradicin<p>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Latinos and the </p>Church  church <p>were used and abused by anti-immigrant forces in California last week  and Barron, along with his babbling brother bishops and the boycotters, has yet to say a word.</p><p>I'm talking about the</p> June 2 Friday <p>drop</p> -<p>off of 16 Venezuelan and Colombian migrants at the headquarters of the Diocese of Sacramento. </p><p>California </p>Attorney General Atty. Gen.<p> Rob Bonta said the documents the migrants carried showed that their journey on a charter flight from El Paso to New Mexico, then to Sacramento was arranged by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That Sunshine State government agency had previously arranged similar trips to Democrat-run cities and states at the behest of </p> Republican <p>Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose budget last year set aside $12 million for the task.</p><p>After days of silence, a spokesperson for the agency characterized the flight, along with a subsequent one </p> on this past<p> Monday, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-06/florida-migrants-sacramento">as a voluntary relocation.</a></p><p>The spokesperson, Alecia Collins, also said that a contractor "ensured they made it safely to" Catholic Charities, a nationwide nonprofit that helps the poor but which Collins characterized as "used and funded by the federal government."</p><p>DeSantis, who's running for president, hasnt publicly commented on the matter. But when the Division of Emergency Management transported over 50 migrants to Marthas Vineyard </p>last  in <p>September, the governor snidely declared, We are not a sanctuary state, and its better [for migrants] to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction.</p><p>Thats what makes the wholesale dumping of migrants on the Diocese of Sacramento so vile. Florida is making a mockery of Catholicism as much it's taking a jab at Newsom, who is a frequent DeSantis critic (and vice versa). </p> <p>Since the founding of this country, no Christian denomination has centered poor immigrants and refugees the way Catholicism has. The </p>C<p>church knew that its faithful  Germans, Irish, Italians, Czechs, Poles, Italians, Latinos</p>,<p> and so many more  needed a safe space to maintain their devotions and customs while navigating a new land.</p><p>Sanctuary is at the core of Catholic beliefs</p>,<p> because it's all over the Bible, from the Pentateuch to Psalms, the Gospel to the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where </p>Paul <p>the Apostle </p> Paul <p>wrote that Christians "are the temple of the living God" and thus should act as such toward others. This embrace of the poor and meek, however, has long angered non-Catholics, who stereotyped each wave of Catholic migrants as unwashed and ignorant and the </p>C<p>church as an exploitative entity concerned only with itself.</p><p>The DeSantis administration's Sacramento stunt is nothing more than a cruel joke on the </p>C<p>church that takes advantage of Catholic goodwill while cleaning </p>their its <p>own hands of any responsibility. And this isn't the first time a Republican governor has pulled something like this: </p> L<p>ast year, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-19/migrants-transported-california-texas-abbott-desantis">Texas flew eight Venezuelan men to Sacramento</a> with no money and the address of Catholic Charities.</p><p>The Book of Proverbs tells believers to not mess with the poor, or "the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them." Tell that to the conservative Catholic activists who are decrying the Dodgers.</p><p>These people call Catholics like me apostates for opposing the </p>C<p>church's doubling down on culture war issues at the expense of social justice. Since the rise of Donald Trump, they have conveniently overlooked the part of the United States Conference </p>on  of <p>Catholic Bishops website stating that church teachings have consistently reinforced our moral obligation to treat the stranger as we would treat Christ himself. </p><p>They roll their eyes at statements like the one Pope Francis issued last month </p>Maylast month <p>that Catholics should ensure there will "always be a community ready to welcome, protect, promote and integrate everyone, without distinctions and without excluding anyone.</p><p>Conservative Catholic activists instead have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-06-02/column-desantis-and-trump-compete-to-take-the-most-extreme-stance-on-immigration">doubled down on the      right's   Right's anti-immigrant war,</a> arguing that the people lining up on the southern border to enter the United States arent like Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and thus deserve no refuge. They filled Trump's </p> C<p>abinet and defended his policies while still attending Mass with a straight face. </p><p>Tellingly, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article267349297.html" target="_blank">the three main architects</a> of Floridas migrant-shipping strategy have ties to the </p>C<p>church: DeSantis is a cradle Catholic;</p>,<p> his chief of staff James Uthmeier teaches religious education at St. Thomas More Co-Cathedral in Tallahassee, and public safety czar Larry Keefe used to be president of a Florida chapter of Catholic Charities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Catholics who actually read the Bible have stepped up to help the migrants stranded in Sacramento. Area nonprofits are offering shelter and food, while Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto told the </p>press  media<p>, We recognize the humble presence of Jesus, and we hear his call to stand by the migrants.</p><p>Humble advocacy in times of crisis is what good Catholics do</p>,<p> because Jesus said good works are best done outside the limelight. He didn't like the Bishop Barrons of the world, describing them in the Gospel of Matthew as standing "on the street corners to be seen by men." </p><p>In fact, Christ had a name for them: </p>H<p>hypocrites.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The Biden administration has been targeting that timeline for months, but the deal ends any hope of a further extension of the pause, which has been prolonged while the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-02/editorial-court-should-not-yank-away-lifeline-for-people-drowning-in-student-debt">Supreme Court decides the presidents debt cancellation</a>.</p><p>A Republican measure overturning Bidens student loan cancellation plan passed the Senate last week, but the president vetoed the bill Wednesday.</p> Anxious about your student loan debt? Beware of offers that are too good to be true<p>Without cancellation, the Education Department predicts borrowers will fall behind on their loans at historic rates. Among the most vulnerable are those who finished college during the pandemic. Millions have never had to make a loan payment, and their bills will soon come amid soaring inflation and forecasts of economic recession.</p><p>Advocates fear it will add a financial burden that younger borrowers cant afford.</p><p>I worry that were going to see levels of default of new graduates that weve never seen before, said Natalia Abrams, president of the nonprofit Student Debt Crisis Center. </p><p>Chanthanouvong earned a bachelors in sociology from the University of California, Merced, in 2019. She couldnt find a job for a year, leaving her to rely on odd jobs for income. She found a full-time job last year, but at $70,000, her salary barely covers the cost of living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Im not going out. I dont buy Starbucks every day. Im cooking at home, she said. And sometimes, I dont even have $100 after everything.</p><p>Under President </p>Joe <p>Bidens cancellation plan, Chanthanouvong would be eligible to get $20,000 of her debt erased, leaving her owing $5,000. But she isnt banking on the relief. Instead, she invited her partner to move in and split rent. The financial pinch has them postponing or rethinking major life milestones. </p> Editorial: Supreme Court should not yank away the lifeline for people drowning in student debt<p>My partner and I agreed, maybe we dont want kids, she said. Not because we dont want them, but because it would be financially irresponsible for us to bring a human being into this world.</p><p>Out of the more than 44 million federal student loan borrowers, about 7 million are below the age of 25, according to data from the Education Department. Their average loan balance is less than $14,000, lower than any other age group.</p><p>Yet borrowers with lower balances are the most likely to default. It's fueled by millions who drop out before graduating, along with others who graduate but struggle to find good jobs. Among those who defaulted in 2021, the median loan balance was $15,300, and the vast majority had balances under $40,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p>Resuming student loan payments will cost U.S. consumers $18 billion a month, the investment firm Jefferies has estimated. The hit to household budgets is ill-timed for the overall economy, Jefferies says, because the United States is widely believed to be on the brink of a recession.</p><p>Despite the student loan moratorium, Americans mostly didn't bank their savings, according to Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. So theyll likely have to cut back on other things  travel, restaurants  to fit resumed loan payments into their budgets. Belt-tightening could hurt an economy that relies heavily on consumer spending.</p> Letters to the Editor: Is canceling student debt fair? <p>Noshin Hoque graduated from Stony Brook University early in the pandemic with about $20,000 in federal student loans.

She cut costs by living with her parents in New York City and her job at a nonprofit paid enough to save money and help her parents.</p><p>She recalls splurging on a $110 polo shirt as a Fathers Day gift for her dad.</p><p>Being able to do stuff for my parents and having them experience that luxury with me has just been such a plus, said Hoque, who works for Young Invincibles, a nonprofit that supports student debt cancellation.</p><p>It gave her the comfort to enter a new stage of life. She got married to a recent medical school graduate, and they're expecting their first child in November. At the same time, theyre bracing for the crush of loan payments, which will cost at least $400 a month combined. They hope to pay more to avoid interest, which is prohibited for them as practicing Muslims.</p><p>To prepare, they stopped eating at restaurants. They canceled a vacation to Italy. Money they wanted to put toward their childs education fund will go to their loans instead.</p><p>Were back to square one of planning our finances, she said. I feel that so deeply.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>Even the logistics of making payments will be a hurdle for newer borrowers, said Rachel Rotunda, director of government relations at National </p>Association  Assn.<p> of Student Financial Aid Administrators. They'll need to find out who their loan servicers are, choose a repayment plan and learn to navigate the payment system.</p><p>The volume of borrowers going back on the system at the same time  this has never happened before, Rotunda said. It's fair to say it's going to be bumpy.</p><p>The Education Department has promised to make the restart of payments as smooth as possible. In a statement, the agency said it will continue to push for Biden's debt cancellation as a way to reduce borrowers' debt load and ease the transition.</p><p>For Beka Favela, 30, the payment pause provided independence. She earned a master's in counseling last year, and her job as a therapist allowed her to move out of her parents' house.</p><p>Without making payments on her $80,000 in student loans, she started saving. She bought furniture. She chipped away at credit card debt. But once the pause ends, she expects to pay about $500 a month. It will consume most of her disposable income, leaving little for surprise costs. If finances get tighter, she wonders </p>if  whether<p> she'll have to move back home.</p><p>I dont want to feel like I'm regressing in order to make ends meet, said Favela, of Westmont, Ill. I just want to keep moving forward. I'm worried, is that going to be possible?</p>AP Economics Wwriter Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

After his rent surged past $1,000 a month in early 2021 he feared he would have to move out  until he got a $7,300 lifeline from the federal <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-06-09/state-reaches-settlement-over-pandemic-rent-relief-what-tenants-and-landords-need-to-know">Emergency Rental Assistance Program</a>.</p><p>That kept him in his apartment and even helped him build a small nest egg. Now graduated and working full time, hes a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-03-29/buying-a-socal-house-the-great-home-hunt-guide">first-time home buyer</a>.</p><p>Bautista is one of millions of renters who benefited from temporary programs put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on evictions, income support  and the rental assistance program. One of the most ambitious investments in emergency housing in the nations history, it has disbursed $46 billion in aid to state and local governments since early 2021 and kept millions of people in their homes, according to an analysis of government data by Bloomberg News.</p><p>With rents still climbing and the economy at risk of a recession, housing advocates are urging the Biden administration to keep helping tenants. That will be hard under legislation signed into law last weekend that suspended the nations borrowing limit as it clawed back unused pandemic aid and imposed caps on future increases in the federal budget.</p><p>We are facing an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet Republican lawmakers are insisting on slashing funding for and jeopardizing the future of critical housing affordability programs that support working families, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said in a statement.</p> State reaches settlement over pandemic rent relief: What tenants and landlords need to know <p>Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau show that, on average, 48.46 million people reported being caught up on their rent during the first quarter of this year, 4.7 million more than before the Emergency Rental Assistance Program was put in place as the economy was reeling from shutdowns. Even though the estimated number of renters in the country increased during the period, the number of people behind on their rent fell.</p><p>These policies drove eviction filing rates to historic lows," </p>according to <p>a <a href="https://evictionlab.org/covid-era-policies-cut-eviction-filings-by-more-than-half/">report</a> from the Eviction Lab </p> stated<p>. Eviction filings were cut by more than half </p> inof<p> 31 cities they sampled, largely due to COVID-era policies, according to the lab, a housing research group at Princeton University.</p><p>Nevertheless, Republicans have shown little appetite for continuing pandemic-era programs, including for rent assistance, as they seek to reduce the federal budget deficit.</p><p>Progressives attempts to make crisis programs permanent, even after an emergency ends, is just another example of Democrats spending taxpayer money we dont have, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a key negotiator on the debt limit bill, said in a statement. Now its time to end this program.</p><p>The Treasury Department let states, counties and cities use the emergency rent aid in one of three ways: on direct assistance to households, housing stability measures and administrative expenses. About $33 billion of the $46 billion was used for direct assistance to more than 7 million households, according to a Bloomberg evaluation of Treasury data.</p> L.A. County supervisors propose adopting permanent rental protections<p>States, on average, sent 70% of their used funds directly to tenants and landlords, and those that spent most of the money for direct assistance tended to help more tenants get up to date on their rent  suggesting the program was having the desired effect. California, for example, used more than 75% of the $5.6 billion allocated to it from the rental assistance program for direct aid to tenants and landlords. The result: an average of 986,000 more renters were caught up on rent than before the program was established. New York saw about 440,000 residents catch up, or almost 10% of the tenants in the state.</p><p>North Dakota spent less on rental payments and it is one of four states  Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia are the others  that saw the number of tenants behind on rent grow.</p><p>Direct assistance was limited to renters with an income below 80% of the areas median income and who were able to demonstrate that they were at risk of homelessness and </p>and<p> were suffering a financial hardship because of the pandemic.</p><p>Bautista, the former University of Texas student, met the eligibility </p> requirements<p>. He now works as a management assistant for a low-income housing coalition. On the side, he doles out affordable housing advice to college students and recent grads.</p><p>Im not supposed to be where I am today, he said. This program changed my life.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>The Treasury Department and state governments were criticized&nbsp;for dispersing money too slowly at the programs onset. Some states even had their funding reallocated.</p><p>The Treasury said it tracked some information</p> ,<p> like the number of dollars distributed, the number of households served</p>,<p> and the demographics of its applicants. However, program administrators said they didn't have the bandwidth to measure or poll whether recipients were able to catch up on rent while it was dispersing funds.</p><p>We faced a race with time. Experts were projecting a tsunami of evictions if we did not get the emergency rental payments flowing before the eviction moratorium ended, Gene Sperling, a senior White House advisor and coordinator of the Biden administrations American Rescue Plan, said in a statement. The fact that we actually saw eviction rates go below historic averages was proof we did get payments out in time.</p><p>Data on evictions is hard to come by, said Peter Hepburn, associate director of the Eviction Lab. There are more than 3,000 independently operated county courts that handle evictions, many of which often keep documents sealed, undigitized or both.</p><p>The lab credits the pandemic measures for preventing at least 800,000 evictions in 31 U.S. metropolitan areas it studied.</p><p>The rental assistance program itself has been a godsend and a blessing for everyone who has been able to use those funds to remain housed, said Mark Fessler, deputy director of litigation and training at the nonprofit South Carolina Legal Services.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Gen. Ken Paxton was charged Friday with making false statements to mortgage lenders to obtain $172 million in loans. The federal indictment of real estate developer Nate Paul is the result of a years-long FBI investigation  a probe Paxton involved his office in, setting off a chain of events that led to a separate federal probe of the attorney general and <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-26/texas-house-panel-impeachment-attorney-general-ken-paxton">his impeachment</a> </p> and suspension from office last month. Paul was charged with eight counts of making false statements while seeking loans from mortgage lenders in the U.S. and Ireland. There was no mention of Paxton or the attorney generals office during the hearing. Paul, 36, who entered the federal courtroom shackled and wearing jeans, a blue shirt and    sneakers,   Nikes, did not enter a plea during his initial appearance in an Austin court and did not visibly react as the charges were read. He was released ahead of trial but ordered to surrender his passport and inform the court of any travel outside Texas. Following the hearing, Paul left through a back door and climbed into a car in a gated area outside the courthouse. Paul is adamant that he is not guilty," defense attorney Gerry Morris said after    the  hearing, adding that he did not know when his client last spoke with Paxton. An attorney for Paxton, Dan Cogdell, had speculated Thursday evening that prosecutors might use the charges against Paul to try to get him to flip and cooperate in the investigation of the attorney general. Paul is accused of overstating his assets and understating his liabilities while seeking loans in 2017 and 2018, including by giving    a  financial institution false and counterfeit records. In one case, prosecutors said, Paul told banks he had $18 million in an account when he had less than $13,000. In another case laid out in the 23-page indictment, Paul is accused of having $28 million in liabilities but giving a credit union in 2018 a far lower number. The FBI on Thursday arrested a businessman at the center of the scandal that led to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-05-27/texas-house-launches-historic-impeachment-proceedings-against-attorney-general-ken-paxton">Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton's historic impeachment</a></p> amid new questions about their dealings raised by financial records that Paxton's lawyers divulged to try to clear him of bribery allegations. Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, 36, was taken into custody by federal agents and booked into an Austin jail in the afternoon, according to Travis County Sheriffs Office records. It was not immediately clear what charges led to his arrest, but the records showed that he was being held on a federal detainer for a felony.Paul's arrest followed a years-long federal investigation into his dealings  a probe that Paxton, a Republican, got his office involved in, setting off a chain of events that <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-26/texas-house-panel-impeachment-attorney-general-ken-paxton">ultimately led to his impeachment</a></p> last month.Lawyers for Paul did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One of Paxton's defense attorneys, Dan Cogdell, said he had no additional information on the arrest. The FBI declined to comment, and a spokesman for federal prosecutors in West Texas did not respond to inquiries. <p>FBI agents examining Paul's troubled real estate empire searched his Austin offices and palatial home in 2019. The following year, eight of Paxton s top deputies reported the attorney general to the FBI on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-24/texas-ag-ken-paxton-likely-broke-laws-republican-investigation">allegations of bribery and abusing his office</a>, </p> including for hiring an outside lawyer to examine the developers claims of wrongdoing by federal agents. to help Paul.

The bribery counts say that in return the developer employed a woman with whom Paxton had an extramarital affair and paid for expensive renovations to the attorney generals million-dollar Austin home.

Last year, one of those receivers wrote in a report that Cupertino Builders was used for fraudulent transfers from Paul's business.Last year a court-appointed overseer for some of Pauls companies wrote in a report that Cupertino Builders was used for fraudulent transfers from his business to Narsimha Raju Sagiraju, who was convicted of fraud in California in 2016.

They were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Tony Buzbee, a prominent Houston attorney who was hired by Paxton over the weekend and led the news conference, said by email Thursday that receipts clearly demonstrate Paxton paid for the repairs himself. He did not address questions about the timing of the payments or about Cupertino Builders.Without any evidence the politicians leading this sham impeachment falsely accused [Attorney] General Paxton of not paying for the repairs to his home. That is a lie, Buzbee said.Since becoming just the third sitting official in Texas history to be impeached, Paxton has attacked the proceedings as politically motivated and rushed, saying he was never given the chance to rebut the accusations in the House.We have the receipts, Buzbee told reporters Wednesday as the documents flashed onscreen. This is the type of evidence we tried to offer them once we found out this foolishness was going on.Paxton is temporarily suspended from office pending the outcome of a trial in the Texas Senate that is set to begin no later than Aug. 28. The jury will be the members of the 31-seat Senate; one of them, Paxtons wife, Sen. Angela Paxton, has not said <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-30/texas-state-sen-angela-paxton-could-vote-in-trial-on-husband-ken-paxton-impeachment">whether she will recuse herself</a></p>.The Paxtons purchased their Austin home in 2018. When it was remodeled two years later, Paxtons former staff alleged in court documents, Paul was involved in the work.The city has no record of building permits from the time of the renovations. A different Austin contractor  not Cupertino Builders  received a federal grand jury subpoena in 2021 for records related to work on Paxtons home that started in January 2020.Cupertino Builders was formed in October 2020 and dissolved less than two years later, according to Texas corporation records. Its manager was Sagiraju, who said in a deposition in an unrelated case that he did consulting work for Pauls business and had an email address with Pauls company.Sagiraju acknowledged that he served prison time for securities fraud and grand theft in California before moving to Austin, according to a transcript of the deposition. He said that he was first introduced to Paul by a mutual friend before his prison term and that they later did a few projects together.Paxton was separately <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-paxton-indicted-20150803-story.html">indicted on securities fraud charges</a></p> in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Good luck with that.</p><p>This week the Republican field for the presidency took near-final form, and it became clear that among Donald Trumps suddenly expanded number of rivals, some are modeling themselves to varying degrees on that other former president, Ronald Reagan. That strategy is a way of breaking, if only implicitly, with Trump and Trumpism: going back to the future by invoking the most </p>impactful and<p> beloved of modern </p>Republican<p> presidents </p> among Republicans.<p>Of all the announced candidates, none is more overt about embracing Reagan over Trump than Trumps once-obsequious vice president, Mike Pence. At 64, Pence is among the older Trump challengers in the bunch, old enough for Reagan to have been a formative influence for him in real time  as Pence recounted in his presidential announcement in Iowa on Wednesday.</p><p>He started in politics as a Democrat, Pence <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oc6tdrPas">told his assembled supporters.</a> But Ive got to tell ya  as soon as I heard the voice of the 40th president of the United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back.</p><p>He punched those final words for emphasis. Yet even in his friendly audience, the applause was merely polite.</p><p>Thats a telling response. It suggests the very real limits of donning the Reagan mantle, whether for Pence, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, or this weeks other two new entrants in</p>to<p> the contest, former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and second-term North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.</p><p>Reagan, the self-styled optimist who expanded the Republican Partys appeal even as he turned it rightward in the 1980s, is an increasingly faded memory for voters; he left office nearly 35 years ago and soon disappeared from public view, diagnosed with Alzheimers disease. He died two decades ago.</p><p>Invocations of his name and legacy may have animated Republicans once, but now <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=win+one+for+the+gipper&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS725US725&amp;oq=Win+one+for+the+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j46i512j0i512l2j46i512j0i512l4.2538j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:c1c1e07b,vid:_e7rmpjBSR8">the Gipper</a> cant win it for anybody.</p><p>Todays Republican Party is the Trump Party. Even many of its voters who arent solidly MAGAfied nonetheless want Trump in 2024 or  if theyve tired of his maniacal dramas and legal morass  someone like him, just without so much baggage.</p><p>So far, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has dominated that lane. Yes, as governor he did once <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovRonDeSantis/photos/a.643049992419731/3859796984078333/?type=3">declare</a> Feb. 6, the 40</p>th<p> presidents birthday, as Ronald Reagan Day in Florida. But as a presidential candidate, DeSantis is trying to out-Trump Trump  in the right-wing culture wars, with anti-immigration stunts and by populist attacks on iconic corporations  seemingly without regard to how that performance would damage him for the general election, should he win the Republican nomination.</p><p>Hutchinson once joked to Washington journalists at an annual dinner of their Gridiron Club that for DeSantis to challenge Trump would mark the first time a father and son have ever opposed each other for the presidency. Mini-Me DeSantis does share Trump's superpower  shamelessness  and a zeal for punching back and punching down, though hes only lately starting to do so against the former president.</p><p>The potency of Trumpism is evident in the party: Together, Trump and DeSantis have backing from <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/us/2024_republican_presidential_nomination-7548.html">three-quarters of Republican voters</a>, though DeSantis has slid behind the former president in the polling by roughly 30 percentage points on average. Still, he remains Trumps only rival whose party support is in double digits.</p><p>Republican voters, those who participate in primaries and caucuses, arent looking for a return to Reagans trademark sunny optimism and talk of America as the shining city on the hill. Even before Trump (think Newt Gingrich, and the tea party movement), these voters were looking for scrappers whose rhetoric leaned more toward <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/full-text-donald-trump-inauguration-speech-transcript-233907">American carnage</a> and who validated the voters grievances against the elites. Trump just took the pugilism up a notch</p>,<p>  OK, many notches</p>,<p>  and they were hooked. </p><p>Differences between Reaganism and Trumpism arent just ones of style and rhetoric. Theyre substantive, which also works against those who would be Reagan </p> r<p>edux.</p><p>Theres overlap between the -isms, mainly in favoring tax cuts and deregulation. But Reagans defining policies also included some that are now all but anathema in the Trump Party: He was pro-immigration; the landmark 1986 law he signed included amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants. He was for free trade, not protectionism. He was anti-communist and condemned the then-Soviet Union as an evil empire  as <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1635446738906411012">Pence</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilipWegmann/status/1635681800746856449">Haley</a> have suggested, Reagan would surely have opposed Russias invasion of Ukraine and supported U.S. assistance to the defenders.</p><p>On Wednesday, Pence, reflecting his Reaganist bent, slammed Trump and DeSantis, too, for being willing to forfeit American leadership on the world stage and to coddle dictators such as Vladimir Putin. Yet he has to know that muscular internationalism is increasingly unpopular among his would-be voters. They flock behind Trumps isolationist America First banner. The intraparty tension is evident in Congress, where Republicans are split over further aid to Ukraine.</p><p>When candidates for president are mired in single digits in the polls, it cant hurt for them to wrap themselves in the mantle of a party icon. But it wont help them either. Reaganism is the past. The Republican Party shows no signs of going back  and certainly not in time for the 2024 primaries.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackiekcalmes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@jackiekcalmes</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Once Donald Trump had received a formal target letter from the department, his fate was effectively sealed.</p><p>But that was only the latest in a series of recent signs that charges were inevitable. The months and years of questions about whether the Biden administration should or would indict the 45th and would-be next president  and whether the department would stay its hand for politics, the good of the republic or some other reason  were settled when Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel.</p><p>From that point on, the investigation of the former president's retention of classified documents has followed the well-worn path that the federal government would tread for any defendant accused of behavior anywhere close to as brazen as Trump's over the last two years. Smith pursued the case as he would have any other, and that led ineluctably to the indictment unsealed Friday.</p><p>Almost as unavoidably, it will also lead to the department urging a court to impose significant prison time on the former president if he is convicted. Trump's last chance to bargain for less grave charges came and went in his lawyers last meeting with Justice officials on Monday. Now he is in the unenviable position of any other defendant charged with such serious crimes.</p> Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">     37-count indictment  </a></p>  includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal. The government alleges that Trump willfully kept sensitive information about U.S. and foreign defense capabilities and shared classified information with people who did not have security clearances. It also charges a conspiracy to obstruct justice involving Trump and his valet Walt Nauta, who reportedly <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/18/walt-nauta-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-witness/" target="_blank">     lied to FBI agents about the presence of sensitive documents,  </a></p>  only to fess up during subsequent questioning. Nauta, who was also charged, is likely to be an important government witness  and, given his long-standing loyalty to Trump, a very credible one. The indictment also confirms that former Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran will be another important government witness, perhaps the most important. He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The relocation of the unprecedented case from Washington, D.C., to Florida is likely to make the case that much stronger. Although it may sound like a procedural detail, a defendant has a constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried where a crime was allegedly committed. A venue mistake could result in consequences as serious as a case being thrown out with no opportunity for retrial. So the department made the strategic call that the case should proceed in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and the scene of his allegedly illegal record retention.</p> And  though we learned  only this week of much of the activity there, it appears as if a grand jury has been sitting in Florida for several weeks. That's more than long enough for it to absorb previous testimony in the case, which the department could provide by briefing jurors on what happened in the capital.<p>The location also has the effect of underscoring the most damning aspect of the case for Trump. His </p> knowingly<p> taking documents from the White House was almost certainly criminal; his brazen and quintessentially Trumpian refusal to return them, even to the point of lying to the government and involving others in the concealment, was worse.</p>Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">37-count indictment</a></p> includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal.

He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The venue does heighten the risk that an ardently pro-Trump juror will simply refuse to convict him on any grounds, which given the mind-boggling strength of the evidence might be the defendant's only hope. But the justice system has already proved resilient, having produced another indictment of the ex-president, in New York, and an unfavorable civil verdict in the E. Jean Carroll case. </p><p>With the venue issue put to rest, and with courts in the Florida district known for moving fairly quickly, a trial is likely to unfold sooner if the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/aileen-cannon-trump-judge.html" target="_blank">Trump-appointed judge</a> initially assigned to the case doesn't cause unforeseen delays. Its even possible that Trump will be convicted by a federal jury before the 2024 election, for which he remains the overwhelmingly </p> favored<p> front-runner for the Republican nomination, though his appeals would probably continue.</p><p>The Department of Justice has shown the </p> necessary<p> steeliness and dedication to make history in undertaking this prosecution of a former president. And with Smith still investigating Trump's even more outrageous misconduct on and before Jan. 6, 2021, </p> this <p>first such prosecution may well not be the last. </p><p>Next week, meanwhile, Smith's deputies are expected to take their places at the table near the jury box in a federal courtroom and announce their appearance on behalf of the people in United States vs. Trump. Whatever else happens in the coming months, it's a proud moment and a banner achievement for the rule of law in this country.</p>Harry Litman is the host of the&nbsp;<p><a href="https://www.talkingfeds.com/">Talking Feds podcast</a></p>.&nbsp;<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrylitman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@harrylitman</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He was 85.</p><p>Watt died in Arizona on May 27, his son Eric Watt said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>In an administration divided between so-called pragmatists and hard-liners, few stood as far to the right at the time as Watt, who once labeled the environmental movement as preservation vs. people and the general public as a clash between liberals and Americans.</p><p>In that sense, Watt foreshadowed combative interior secretaries like Ryan Zinke and David Bernhardt, who, like Watt, aggressively pushed to grant oil, gas and coal leases on public land, increase offshore drilling and limit expansion of national parks and monuments. </p><p>While no ones death should be celebrated, he was the worst of MAGA before it was invented," tweeted David Donger of the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, referring to former President Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.</p><p>Watt and his supporters saw him as an upholder of President Reagans core conservative values, but opponents were alarmed by his policies and offended by his comments. In 1981, shortly after he was appointed, the Sierra Club collected more than 1 million signatures seeking Watts ouster and criticized such actions as clear-cutting federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, weakening environmental regulations for strip mining and hampering efforts to curtail air pollution in Californias Yosemite Valley.</p><p>With his bald head and thick glasses, he became the rare interior secretary recognizable to the general public, for reasons beyond the environment. He characterized members of a coal advisory panel using derogatory language and in 1983 tried to ban music from Fourth of July festivities on the National Mall, saying it attracted the wrong element.</p><p>The Beach Boys had been recent mall headliners, and their fans included President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. With Watts statement facing widespread mockery, the Reagans invited the Beach Boys for a special White House visit. Watt, meanwhile, was summoned to receive a plaster model of a foot with a hole in it.</p> Interior secretary seeks to rid U.S. of derogatory place names<p>In his 1985 book The Courage of a Conservative, Watt wrote that the controversy actually arose because I was a conservative. Members of a liberal press saw an opportunity to create a controversy by censoring the facts and avoiding the real issues. He said the initial stories about the rock music ban only mentioned that the Beach Boys had performed in the past. Yet before we knew what was happening, banner headlines proclaimed that I had banned the Beach Boys. I was astonished.</p><p>Cutting regulations was his primary mission. Between the time he was confirmed as interior secretary in 1981 until he resigned under pressure in 1983, Watt implemented an offshore leasing program that offered virtually the entire U.S. coastline for oil and gas drilling and held the largest coal lease sale in history, auctioning off 1.1 billion tons </p>(1 billion metric tons)<p> of coal in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming.</p><p>Watt tripled the amount of onshore land being leased for oil and gas exploration and doubled the acreage leased for geothermal resources.</p><p>Watt did spend $1 billion to restore and improve national parks and added 2,800 square miles </p>(7,300 square kilometers)<p> to the nations wilderness system. And his efforts to exploit natural resources made America stronger, he wrote to Reagan in October 1983.</p><p>Our excellent record for managing the natural resources of this land is unequaled  because we put people in the environmental equation, Watt wrote.</p><p>But eight days after writing to the president, he rode horseback into a cow pasture down the road from Reagans California ranch to announce his resignation. He was succeeded by a longtime Reagan aide, William Clark.</p><p>I had outworn my usefulness, Watt said of his decision, adding that others wouldn't get off my case about his insulting coal advisory panel comment.</p><p>Watt was born Jan. 31, 1938, in Lusk, Wyo., and his family later moved to Wheatland, Wyo., where his father practiced law. He attended the University of Wyoming, graduating in 1960 and obtaining a law degree two years later.</p> Interior Department adds $103 million for wildfire hazards and land rehabilitation<p>In 1962, Watt became a personal assistant to former Gov. Milward L. Simpson, and he went to Washington after Simpson was elected to the U.S. Senate later that year. In 1966-69, he helped develop policies on such issues as pollution, mining, public lands and energy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, then in early 1969 he joined the Nixon administration as an Interior Department undersecretary.</p><p>In 1975, President Ford appointed him to the Federal Power Commission.</p><p>While Jimmy Carter was president, Watt worked in the private sector as president and chief legal officer of the pro-development Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver.</p><p>He did consulting work after leaving the Reagan administration, at one point turning heads when he agreed to represent </p>Indian Native American<p> tribes in oil operations and hotel developments after previously labeling </p>Indian Indigenous<p> reservations the failure of socialism. He also accepted six-figure consulting fees to represent developers of a federally subsidized housing project.</p><p>He moved back to Wyoming in 1986 and set up a law office in Jackson, taught at his alma mater and served as a legal consultant and speaker.</p><p>But his consulting work involving federal housing money came under scrutiny in the late 1980s when an investigation was launched into corruption in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>In 1996, he pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor for withholding documents from a grand jury investigating HUD. He was fined $5,000, put on five years probation and ordered to perform community service. He said he had made a serious mistake and hoped to get on with a constructive role in society.</p><p>Over the years, Watt expressed fears that unless they were stopped, radical environmental movements like Earth First! would persuade the cowards of Congress to ban all hunting, eliminate all logging and livestock grazing on public lands and further jeopardize the minerals industries.</p><p>He lived in his later years in Wickenburg, Ariz., with his wife, Leilani.</p>Associated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p><p>The indictment is just one of several legal cases Trump is facing. Here's a rundown of what's happening now, as well as other looming problems for the former president.</p> Trump charged with 34 felony counts in alleged hush money cover-up caseWhy were New York City prosecutors investigating Trump?<p>Because Trump was accused of violating state law while in New York in 2016, when he was running for president.</p><p>One of Trumps former attorneys, Michael Cohen, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1088966/download">admitted in federal court</a> that he paid $130,000 to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-stormy-20180909-story.html">porn actor Stormy Daniels</a> shortly before the 2016 election to keep her from talking about an affair she says she had with Trump. Cohen also admitted in court papers that Trump's New York City-based real estate business reimbursed him the next year but disguised the payments as a large monthly retainer.</p><p>Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels and paying her to stay quiet. One of his current lawyers has accused her of <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-stormy-daniels-attorney-new-york-grand-jury-1788968">extorting money from him</a>. The former president declined an invitation to testify before the Manhattan grand jury.</p>What are the charges?<p>Trump is accused of 34 separate violations of a New York law against <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PEN/175.10" target="_blank">falsifying business records to conceal another crime</a>, a felony punishable by up to four years in state prison and a $5,000 fine. The charges relate to 11 checks written to Cohen in 2017, along with the invoices and account entries associated with them.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.manhattanda.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Donald-J.-Trump-SOF.pdf">statement of facts</a> about the case, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-21/what-to-know-about-alvin-bragg-manhattan-district-attorney-in-trump-case">Dist. Atty. Alvin Bragg Jr.</a> alleged that the payments were part of a scheme led by Trump "that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election." As part of that scheme, the statement alleges, Trump and "Lawyer A"  Cohen  made payments either to buy the silence of or bury accusations made by a former Trump Tower doorman in 2015 and two unnamed women. The conspiracy also involved the editor in chief of the National Enquirer, who agreed to pay $30,000 to the doorman and $150,000 to one of the women not to discuss their accusations that Trump had engaged in extramarital affairs, the statement alleges.</p><p>That woman appears to be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-playmate-mcdougal-trump-20180320-story.html">Karen McDougal</a>, a former Playboy Playmate of the Year who sued the parent company of the National Enquirer in 2018 to be released from the contract that barred her from discussing the affair she says she had with Trump. As with Daniels, Trump denies having an affair with McDougal.</p><p>The charges in the indictment relate only to the payment Cohen has admitted making to the second woman, Daniels. The statement alleges that the Trump Organization paid Cohen back through monthly checks in 2017 that it characterized as a legal retainer, even though "there was no such retainer agreement" and Cohen rendered no services that year. Trump signed nine of the checks himself, the statement alleges; the other two were signed by one of Trump's sons and the Trump Organization's chief financial officer.</p><p>New York requires defendants to appear in person to be booked, which is why Trump flew to the city Monday for the arraignment Tuesday. Accompanied by Secret Service agents, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-03/photos-as-country-steels-for-tuesday-new-york-prepares-for-trump-and-trouble">he turned himself in at a Manhattan courthouse</a> early Tuesday afternoon and reportedly was booked, but no mugshot was taken. </p>   What happens next?  Under New York law, prosecutors have a little more than a month to share with Trump's defense team the relevant evidence they've gathered. The judge, Justice Juan Manuel Merchan, also laid out a schedule for motions to be considered, which will be the next major action in the case. The defense is expected to file a number of motions, including requests to dismiss the charges or, failing that, to move the case to a different venue. The charges weren't serious enough to require Trump to post bail, and he'll be free to resume his campaign. His next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 4, two months before the Iowa caucuses formally begin the race for the Republican presidential nomination<p>. </p>The next date for Trump to appear in court is Dec. 4.Is there a statute of limitations on Trump's alleged crimes?<p>There is, but the time limit was extended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the clock stops when the defendant spends an extended amount of time away from New York; some legal analysts say that this would apply to Trump because of the four years he spent in the White House.</p>Does this have anything to do with the 2020 election?<p>No. These accusations relate to the 2016 election, which Trump won.</p> Column: Scandal after scandal, Trump has defied political physics. Will this time be different?Isnt Cohen a convicted liar?<p>Yes. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to lying to a bank about his debts in order to obtain a $500,000 home equity line of credit. He also pleaded guilty to five counts of tax evasion and, in connection to the hush money payments, two campaign finance law violations. </p>Who is Alvin Bragg?<p>Harvard-educated Bragg is the first Black district attorney for the borough of Manhattan, elected in 2021. Before that, he spent years as an attorney and prosecutor for the New York City Council and the state and federal governments.</p><p>Among other cases he has worked over the years, he oversaw the lawsuit by the New York attorney general that accused Trump's charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, of illegally acting as an arm of Trump's 2016 campaign. (The foundation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/nyregion/ny-ag-underwood-trump-foundation.html" target="_blank">dissolved in the wake of the suit.</a>) Bragg also helped obtain the indictment of former Trump advisor Stephen K. Bannon on <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-and-district-attorney-bragg-announce-indictment-steve">fraud charges</a> for allegedly diverting donations that were supposed to be used to build a wall on the Mexican border. (Bannon also faced federal charges connected with the fundraising, but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-19/trump-pardons-more-on-final-full-day-as-president">Trump, on his last full day in office, </a>pardoned him.)</p>Didnt Bragg already prosecute Trump?<p>No. New York prosecutors charged Trumps business and payroll company with criminal tax fraud, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-12-06/trump-organization-guilty-verdict-tax-fruad">winning convictions</a> in December. Previously, they obtained guilty pleas from the Trump Organizations longtime financial chief, Allen Weisselberg, on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-08-18/trump-cfo-weisselberg-plea-deal-prosecution-witness">felonies</a> related to the scheme.</p><p>Shortly after Bragg took office in 2022, he appeared to put the brakes on a criminal investigation into Trumps business practices that had begun under his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr. Two prosecutors working on the probe  which explored whether Trump assigned fraudulent values to his properties when seeking loans, among other allegations  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-02-23/prosecutors-in-charge-of-manhattan-district-attorneys-criminal-probe-of-trump-resign">resigned</a> in apparent protest.</p>What about New York state prosecutors?<p>The state attorney general, Letitia James, in September <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2022/attorney-general-james-sues-donald-trump-years-financial-fraud">filed suit</a> against Trump and several of his family members and businesses, as well as Weisselberg, accusing them of <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/tto_complaint.pdf">fraudulently inflating Trumps net worth</a> on official financial filings. The point of the scheme, the lawsuit alleges, was to help Trump obtain loans and insurance policies on better terms.</p><p>This a civil case seeking financial penalties, not a criminal case seeking jail terms. But James referred the matter to the IRS and the Justice Department for possible criminal charges, alleging that Trump <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/21/trump-criminal-referral-sent-to-prosecutors-and-irs-by-letitia-james.html">violated federal laws</a> against fraud and making false statements to financial institutions.</p> 'I'm emancipated now': Nancy Pelosi enjoying life after leadershipIsn't Merrick Garland prosecuting Trump?<p>Not at this point. </p><p>U.S. Atty. Gen. Garland appointed a special counsel to lead the Justice Department's investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-02-10/ap-source-trump-team-turns-over-items-marked-as-classified">keeping some classified documents</a> after leaving the presidency. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-02-07/what-we-know-about-the-trump-special-counsel-investigation">special counsel, Jack Smith,</a> is also examining Trumps role in the Jan. 6, 2021, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-01-04/the-jan-6-attack-on-the-u-s-capitol-one-year-later">attack on the U.S. Capitol.</a></p><p>The much-publicized <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-08-09/fbi-search-of-trumps-home-shows-seriousness-of-information-being-sought">FBI search</a> last year at the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida related to the classified documents case. </p><p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing there or in connection with the events of Jan. 6.</p>Who else is pursuing charges against Trump?<p>One case that has made headlines is the investigation by a Fulton County, Ga., grand jury into an alleged attempt to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-02-16/georgia-special-grand-jury-report-on-2020-election-fraud-released">interfere with the 2020 presidential election</a>. This case revolves around post-election efforts by Trump and his supporters to reverse the outcome in Georgia, where Joe Biden narrowly won. Fulton County Dist. Atty. Fani Willis has not yet acted on the recommendations from the grand jury, which <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-02-21/inside-georgia-grand-jury-trump-election-meddling">called for multiple indictments</a>.</p><p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing in this case as well.</p> Trump's running mate? Republicans are already jockeying for considerationWould being arrested affect Trumps ability to serve as president?<p>No. Even if he were convicted and sent to prison, Trump could serve as president  the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/#:~:text=No%20Person%20except%20a%20natural,been%20fourteen%20Years%20a%20Resident">U.S. Constitution requires</a> only that a president be at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen and a resident of the U.S. for at least 14 years.</p><p>Any criminal charges against Trump would certainly affect his campaign. And if he were imprisoned, winning the 2024 election wouldnt automatically cut short his sentence. </p><p>It's unclear how he would be able to discharge the duties of his office from a prison cell, which means the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27#toc-amendment-xxv">25th Amendment</a> could come into play. Under that, a president can hand off his duties temporarily to the vice president if he cannot perform them himself, or the duties can be taken from him if the vice president and a majority of top executive branch officials vote to do so.</p><p>Once in office, Trump could not be removed unless the House impeached him (for a third time) and the Senate convicted him (for the first time).</p><p>By the way, the Constitution doesnt say whether the high crimes and misdemeanors required for impeachment can occur before a president takes office. In fact, it leaves it to Congress to decide what acts constitute impeachable offenses and when they must have occurred.</p>What has been the reaction from Trump and his supporters? possibly just cut this section or update later with reax from the indictment? -mbTrump issued a plea earlier this month Saturday on Truth Social for his supporters to protest Tuesday, prompting Bragg to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-03-19/d-a-leading-trump-case-says-rhetoric-wont-intimidate-office">issue an internal memo</a></p> saying, "We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York." Even staunch Trump allies such as <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-01-07/la-na-pol-mccarthy-house-speaker-fight">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a></p> (R-Bakersfield) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) urged supporters not to protest.Three other Trump allies in the House, however, have <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3908625-house-republicans-seek-testimony-from-manhattan-da-on-trump-hush-money-probe/?email=9a382056d4cc2f0b28ff2ce5caae9e29c0217982&amp;emaila=f9581a54ed295155b7c9e622bae8a60c&amp;emailb=496cab7c892d716bea0fc157d896b5e696d046b91384b56859186c6f2e9391a3&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=03.20.23%20KB%20The%20Hill%20-%20News%20Alert%20-%20House%20gop">demanded that Bragg testify before their committees</a></p>, as soon as possible. The trio  Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), James Comer&nbsp;(R-Ky.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), who head the House Judiciary, Oversight and Administration committees, respectively  suggested that the investigation was politically motivated and would interfere with next year's presidential election, while also eroding the public's confidence in "the evenhanded application of justice."Other Republicans echoed the accusation that Bragg's investigation was political. Among them was a likely Trump rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Arnold Schwarzenegger commanded popularity enough to persuade California's voters to swallow the harshest fiscal medicine.</p><p>The tragedy of his governorship is that he never used it.</p><p>The roots of the state's dysfunction were well known in Sacramento in 2003, when Schwarzenegger took office, and still are today: It's too easy to enact spending programs by ballot initiative, too hard to get the required two-thirds vote of the Legislature to pass a budget and impossible to keep talented legislators around when they're rapidly turfed out by term limits.</p><p>The tax structure bequeathed us by 1978's Proposition 13 is lunacy; it places too much emphasis on the personal income tax, which frustrates the wealthy and the entrepreneurial class, and on the sales tax, which hammers the working class.</p><p>The school financing system (also an offspring of Proposition 13) is even more nuts. It hamstrings local administrators by making them beholden to nostrums issued from Sacramento.</p><p>Everybody feels shortchanged in this state  rich and poor, employer and employee, student and teacher  and not without reason. This is the crisis Schwarzenegger was elected to solve, and he never laid a finger on it.</p><p>Why? Because these fundamental issues were not on Schwarzenegger's radar screen.</p><p>Schwarzenegger had some good qualities as governor and some sound instincts. Very early on he heeded the call to reform the worker's compensation system, though he probably didn't go far enough. His environmental initiatives met the most progressive standards, and we owe him gratitude for helping to fight off the mendacious Proposition 24 campaign to roll those initiatives back in November.</p><p>He understood the need for healthcare reform, even if he couldn't get it done. For the most part he didn't let braying right-wing Republicans (about all that's left of the GOP in California) move him off socially moderate positions on gay rights and similar issues.</p><p>Yet on the central issue of his tenure, fiscal reform, Schwarzenegger proved to be an action star with feet of clay.</p><p>Why is that? Perhaps the reason is that the state's persistent budget crisis is deeply interwoven with the flaws in its government structure, and untangling that mess requires both hard labor and imagination.</p><p>One might argue that Schwarzenegger's fundamental flaw as governor was his consistent lack of imagination. He didn't seem to see the irony in his coasting into office by attacking Gray Davis for borrowing to close a budget gap, then submitting an alternative budget that closed the deficit with a bond issue.</p><p>He could proclaim himself the sworn enemy of "special interests," yet deliver to the California Chamber of Commerce 100% of its legislative wish list in 2004.</p><p>It's not unusual for high-profile politicians to bask in their own self-esteem. But Schwarzenegger took this habit to extremes. That's unsurprising, since TV hosts and the out-of-state press treated him as a movie star even while he was failing at the mundane job of running a statehouse.</p><p>Once the TV cameras were packed up, the lights went dim in <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7153305/ns/msnbc_tv-hardball_with_chris_matthews/">Chris Matthews' set</a> and the out-of-state reporters filed their <a href="https://www.hypercycles.org/forums/archive/index.php/t-750.html">stories about motorcycle trips</a> with the Governator, the hard work remained. To be an effective governor you have to suffer fools gladly, and absorb the sufferance of adversaries who think the fool is you. You have to spend half your life in the weeds of policy wonkdom and like it.</p><p>Signs emerged even during his first campaign that Schwarzenegger wouldn't be the kind of governor who took bold policy steps.</p><p>Shortly before the recall election, his handpicked economic guru, Warren Buffett, publicly made the point that Proposition 13 created tax inequities that cost the state money and sapped public confidence.</p><p>The Schwarzenegger juggernaut had already built up such a head of steam that it's doubtful it could have been derailed had he agreed that some aspects of Proposition 13 needed to be on the table. Instead, he publicly slapped Buffett down.</p><p>Plainly he never imagined how briefly the window of public adoration would stay open for him. His tendency to personalize policy disputes and his preference for conventional solutions helped slam it shut.</p><p>In his second year in office Schwarzenegger concocted for the November 2005 ballot a slate of four ballot initiatives ostensibly aimed at promoting fiscal responsibility. But only one dealt with the state budget process  a perfectly conventional mandated spending ceiling  while two were aimed vindictively at schoolteachers and public employee unions. All were defeated.</p><p>It was his worst rebuff until May 2009, when he put five fiscal initiatives on the ballot, including a couple of impenetrable tax measures. They all lost by huge margins. (A sixth punitive measure aimed at the state Legislature passed.)</p><p>Schwarzenegger's very first gubernatorial act, rescinding a rise in the car tax, was his greatest failure of imagination, instantly blowing a nearly $4-billion annual hole in his budget.</p><p>Schwarzenegger had telegraphed this step during his campaign by dropping a wrecking ball on an Oldsmobile spray-painted with the words "Davis Car Tax." Yet in following through, he made himself Exhibit A for the adage, which I've just coined, that politicians always become prisoners of their own panders. (cf. immigration and Whitman, Meg.)</p><p>The consequent revenue gap poisoned Schwarzenegger's entire administration. He could never fill it, because his imagination hadn't registered the basic truism that in California it's very easy to take a wrecking ball to an old tax but almost impossible to enact a new one. Of the state's currently estimated budget gap of more than $25 billion, 100% would have been covered by an unwrecked car tax.</p><p>That's assuming that spending didn't rise and suck up the revenue. The mantra of "we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem" was an essential part of the Schwarzenegger shtick. If only he'd listened to himself talk.</p><p>Schwarzenegger was never exactly Mr. Austerity. On the November 2004 ballot he endorsed two bond issues that added nearly $4 billon to the state's capital debt, not including interest. One was the <a href="https://cirm.ca.gov/AboutCIRM_Prop71">stem cell bond,</a> which can be spent with virtually no oversight from Sacramento; why would a governor be in favor of that?</p><p>His first foray into the political arena was a campaign to enact a 2002 ballot initiative creating an after-school program that can't be touched by the Legislature and that now costs $550 million a year. Did he imagine this might place extra strain on a state budget struggling to balance priorities in K-12 education? Not then, and not now.</p><p>So now the Schwarzenegger administration, which began in a burst of naked opportunism seven years ago, ends with a sour joke.</p><p>The opportunism was reflected in Schwarzenegger's perception that in the gubernatorial recall free-for-all of 2003, he might win by positioning himself as a giant candidate towering over 134 pygmies.</p><p>The sour joke is the governor's final <a href="https://www.dof.ca.gov/budget/historical/2010-11/documents/2010-11_SS_Budget_WEB.pdf">proposal to balance the state budget</a> through program cuts, submitted last week to a special "who cares" session of a state Legislature already looking ahead to the Brown era.</p><p>If there is a significant "savings" proposed in this plan that doesn't involve cutting benefits to families already living close to the poverty line, I can't find it. One struggles to understand why Schwarzenegger even bothered to go through the exercise  does he really want one of the final published documents of his regime to be a blueprint for cuts in grants to the disabled and elderly and the elimination of child-care programs?</p><p>Yet that's what makes appraising the departing administration such a challenge. It's hard to think of Schwarzenegger as a man who thinks that increasing the economic insecurity of the poorest Californians is a good thing. He just can't think of a way around it, given that as much as 80% of the state budget isn't amenable to gubernatorial or legislative adjustment. The only give left is in the money spent on the poor and the politically disenfranchised, so when a governor decides to go with the flow, guess who gets whacked.</p><p>Nobody gets the last laugh in this comedy. Schwarzenegger leaves office with a popularity rating down in the Gray Davis subbasement. The state's middle class and working class feel squeezed as never before. Nor does the business community have much to crow about. California is still ranked near the bottom of all states on the business-friendly list; I certainly haven't detected a decline in complaints about intrusive state regulations. (Maybe business owners are relieved it isn't worse.)</p><p>Schwarzenegger no doubt will seek praise for keeping tax increases to a minimum during his tenure. But the last seven years have seen many stealth tax hikes, such as steep increases in tuition and fees at UC and Cal State, and squeezes on local and school budgets. Make no mistake, it's the middle class who pays most of these.</p><p>Ask the guy who paid for a front-end repair because his car hit a pothole if skimping on street paving saved him any money. Ask the parents reaching into their own pockets to keep their kids' art and music teachers employed if the sensation was any different from paying a tax. Ask the students forced to spend an extra year at UC Berkeley or UCLA to get the classes they need to graduate if the state university was as much of a bargain as they expected. Ask the business owner sending his workers to remedial training if he thinks the state is adequately funding K-12 education.</p><p>These aren't entirely the doing of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But all these conditions got worse because of the failure to come to grips with the real issues of state government that was Schwarzenegger's hallmark.

He was a community organizer, a law professor and an Illinois state senator who served as a United States senator for about 10 minutes before deciding he was ready to move into the Oval Office.</p><p>Harris was the district attorney in San Francisco, the attorney general of California, a United States senator and a brief front-runner in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination before Biden tapped her as his No. 2.</p><p>So what, exactly, do people mean when they say </p>that <p>Harris is ill-</p> e<p>quipped to step up in the event that something terrible were to befall Biden?</p><p>She is already first in line to the presidency; she </p>already has<p> that job.</p><p>In objections to Harris as a potential president, I hear echoes of the vague complaints that plagued Hillary Clinton, a former first lady, policy wonk and United States senator when she ran against Obama in 2008, and also a former secretary of </p> S<p>tate by the time she ran for president against Donald Trump in 2016: </p>I just dont like her.<p>Why is that?</p><p>Well, some people perceive Harris as inauthentic or haughty. Some are annoyed by her tendency to laugh. The Wall Street Journals Peggy Noonan infamously found it embarrassing that <a href="https://therecount.com/watch/kamala-harris-is-dancing-in/2645863049" target="_blank">Harris danced in the rain</a> in Jackson, Miss., during a campaign appearance in 2020. </p><p>They knock her for a lack of concrete accomplishments, describing her vice presidential record as underwhelming. (But come on</p> now<p>; Biden first put her in charge of fixing the intractable humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and also with leading the administrations push for federal voting rights legislation, which ran head first into the refusal of two Senate Democrats  Joe Manchin III and </p> Kyrsten Sinema<p>  to support changing Senate rules.)</p><p>Anyway, pundits have been declaring Harris in trouble almost since the beginning of the Biden </p> a<p>dministration. They have lazily settled on a narrative that is only loosely tethered to reality.</p><p>The narrative goes something like this, said veteran </p> California<p> political journalist Dan Morain, author of the biography Kamalas Way. She was picked because shes a woman and a person of color, not for any of her accomplishments, skills, intelligence or abilities. The narrative doesnt concede she has any of those attributes. Fox hosts play a role. Much as good liberals hate to admit it, the vile stuff gets into the air and bloodstream and infects their thinking. She is very intelligent. I have seen her campaign, in debates, in press conferences and in smaller gatherings, and she is a talented politician.</p><p>The narrative gained new force last week, when Biden announced <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-04-25/joe-biden-age-reelection-polls-donald-trump-tucker-carlson">he would seek reelection</a>, with Harris as his running mate again. Already the oldest president in American history, Biden would be 82 at his second inauguration.</p><p>Whoever the Republican nominee is will run against Kamala Harris, said Morain.</p><p>Which is why the drumbeat of negativity against her </p> just keeps getting louder.has begun.<p>Its true that her low approval ratings have tracked those of the president. She has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html" target="_blank">few concrete policy achievements</a> to show as vice president. And of course, there is still a bad taste left over from her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020.html" target="_blank">stunning fall from grace </a>as a 2020 presidential front-runner, when she oversaw  or didnt  a chaotic, underfunded campaign that floundered when it could not settle on a strategy, or even a tag line.</p><p>But we cannot ignore <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/27/ron-klain-kamala-harris-sexism-criticism-00094166" target="_blank">the hurdles inherent in her very identity</a>. Regardless of how far this country has come in its attitudes about race, regardless of the fact that we elected a Black man as president in 2008 and 2012, only a fool would pretend the presidential playing field is even for a biracial woman like Harris, and I do emphasize </p>the word <p> woman.</p><p>Studies, after all, show that voters associate leadership with masculinity. No elective office is more masculine than the presidency, said the authors of a study excerpted in <a href="https://www.politicalparity.org/research/research-inventory/" target="_blank">Political Parity,</a> a website associated with the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics. The president, as commander in chief, is expected to embody masculinity and exhibit toughness.</p><p>Toughness?</p><p>Who can forget <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/09/06/kamala-harris-kavanaugh-hearing-abortion-rights-sot-vpx.cnn" target="_blank">Harris performance </a>during Brett M. Kavanaughs Supreme Court </p> confirmation <p>hearings when, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she looked at the flummoxed nominee and repeated her question slowly and deliberately, Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?</p><p>Or, in 2018, when she grilled a recalcitrant then-Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions so hard that <a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/11508303/jeff-sessions-to-kamala-harris-being-rushed-makes-me-nervous" target="_blank">he finally blurted out,</a> "I am not able to be rushed this fast, it makes me nervous.</p><p>Anyone who questions Harris toughness hasnt been paying attention.</p><p>Back in 2020, it may have been true that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-administration.html" target="_blank">Biden needed Harris in order to win</a> but not</p> <p>to govern. In 2024, however, the pair will be yoked as never before. Its up to Biden to make sure Harris has a portfolio  <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2023/02/03/vice-president-kamala-harris-historic-term-abortion-immigration-police-reform" target="_blank">especially on issues like abortion</a> and Black maternal health  that resonates with his voters and hers, that raises her profile.</p><p>Think of it as the Biden/Harris paradox: While no president really wants to spend time pumping up his veep, Biden can help neutralize concerns about his age by showcasing Harris leadership chops.</p><p>And everyone else can bear in mind that in many countries around the world, a female head of state is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2016/06/politics/women-world-leaders/" target="_blank">no big whoop</a>. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/robinkabcarian" target="_blank">@robinkabcarian</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

She also cited execution-style killings, beatings and electrocution.</p><p>The Biden administration determined in March that Russian troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine and said it would work with other countries to prosecute offenders. A determination of crimes against humanity goes further, indicating that attacks against civilians are being carried out in a widespread and systematic manner.</p><p>Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people from Ukraine to Russia, including children, Harris said. They have cruelly separated children from their families.</p><p>She also pointed to the March attack on a theater in Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering, which killed hundreds, and to images of civilians bodies left on the streets of Bucha after the Russian pullback from the Kyiv area last spring.</p><p>Harris said that as a former prosecutor and former head of Californias Department of Justice, she knows the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.</p> 'Always be ready': Along the Ukraine-Belarus border, a war of nerves  and drones<p>In the case of Russias actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt, she said. These are crimes against humanity.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, also attending the Munich conference, said in a statement that we reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes.</p><p>The new determination underlines the staggering extent of suffering inflicted on Ukrainian civilians and the deep commitment of the United States to holding members of Russias forces and other Russian officials accountable for their atrocities, he said.</p><p>In an address to his country Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his government last week had gotten strong signals from our partners, specific agreements on the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people.</p><p>Every Russian attack  on every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state, Zelensky said, citing not just the past year of war but events dating back to 2014, when fighting with Russia-backed separatists first broke out in eastern Ukraine.</p><p>He did not refer specifically to Harris remarks or name countries that had provided agreements on Russian accountability.</p><p>Russias <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-one-year-anniversary-timeline-a1304c6fb319bf1c0e93635f6f6a2633">invasion of Ukraine</a> has dominated discussions at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of security and defense officials from around the world.</p><p>Harris told the partici-pants: Let us all agree  on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served.</p><p>Such is our moral interest, she added. We also have a significant strategic interest.</p><p>No nation is safe in a world where one country can violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another, where crimes against humanity are committed with impunity, where a country with imperialist ambitions can go unchecked, Harris said.</p> Russia steps up attacks in Ukraine with broad bombardments<p>If Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in attacking international rules and norms, other nations could feel emboldened to follow his violent example, she said. Other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the world to their will, through coercion, disinformation and even brute force.</p><p>There were no Russian officials in attendance; conference organizers did not invite them.</p><p>Asked on the sidelines of the event about the U.S. declaration, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said, Russia waged a genocidal war against Ukrainians because they do not recognize our identity, and they do not think we deserve to exist as a sovereign nation.</p><p>Everything that stems from that is crimes against humanity, war crimes and various other atrocities committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine, he added. Let lawyers sort out specifically which act belongs where in terms of legal qualification.</p><p>Kuleba voiced confidence that Ukraine would receive fighter jets from partners, despite their current reluctance.</p><p>He noted that partners initially resisted providing six other types of heavy weapons that were later delivered or promised to Ukraine: antitank weapons, artillery, multiple-launch rocket systems, air defense systems, tanks and long-range missiles.</p><p>So the only outstanding type of weapon is planes, Kuleba said.</p>Geir Moulson contributed to this report from Berlin.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Elizabeth Warren, who challenged Biden and Harris for the 2020 Democratic nomination, caused one of those bouts of Beltway hyperventilation by endorsing the president for a second term but equivocating when it <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2023/01/27/warren-stops-short-of-backing-harris-for-vp-in-2024" target="_blank">came to keeping Harris</a> as his running mate.</p><p>I really want to defer to what makes Biden comfortable on his team, said Warren, who soon followed her conspicuously tepid remarks with a mop-and-bucket statement "fully" supporting the reelection of Biden and Harris "together."</p><p>No matter that Biden has given every sign  in both public and private  that he plans to seek reelection with Harris by his side. The conversations that have taken place regarding 2024 have all been grounded in the presumption she will be on the Democratic ticket, according to several people familiar those discussions. There has been no talk, they said, of a replacement.</p><p>Still, it is "virtually inevitable that whenever a president gets ready to run for reelection there's talk about dumping the vice president," said Joel Goldstein, an emeritus law professor at St. Louis University and expert on the office.</p><p>The chatter may be off base, but it's happening for a reason.</p><p>President George H.W. Bush faced <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-11-ls-33887-story.html">pressure to replace </a>Vice President Dan Quayle, who suffered the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-12-07/kamala-harris-has-it-rough-but-so-did-vice-president-dan-quayle">same kind of lousy approval</a> ratings as Harris. </p><p>Former President George W. Bush considered <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-nov-06-oe-schaller6-story.html">swapping out Dick Cheney</a> as his 2004 running mate as a way, he wrote in his memoirs, to "demonstrate that I was in charge" and that he, not Cheney, was running the White House.</p><p>In 2011, when President Obama was at a low ebb in popularity, the White House chief of staff ordered up research on whether it would be a good idea to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton ahead of Obama's reelection bid. Some of those involved in the campaign <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-xpm-2013-nov-01-la-pn-obama-joe-biden-hillary-clinton-vice-president-20131101-story.html">later insisted </a>it was never a serious option.</p><p>For much of the country's history, Goldstein said, changing vice presidents was not all that unusual.</p><p>The union of president and understudy was often a kind of shotgun marriage, arranged by party bosses to give a ticket regional and/or ideological balance. The working relationship between supposed partners was virtually nonexistent. Vice presidents spent most of their time presiding over the Senate, one of their constitutional duties, rather than offering counsel to the chief executive or helping shape policy.</p><p>That evolved, Goldstein said, over the course of the 20th century. </p><p>In 1921, Calvin Coolidge became the first vice president to regularly sit in on meetings of the president's Cabinet. Over the decades, other vice presidents were increasingly integrated into the workings of the White House. In 1977, Walter Mondale <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-05-01/minnesota-biden-mondale-political-history">became the first</a> to have an office in the West Wing, just a short walk from the Oval Office, where vice presidents have lodged ever since.</p><p>More significantly, by the middle of the 20th century presidents had begun deciding on their own whom they wished to run with  which means replacing their vice president would suggest, at least implicitly, they had made a mistake.</p><p>Harris has her critics within the White House and those around Biden. The relationship between the president and vice president has been described as friendly but not intimate. Even so, the political cost of replacing Harris, if the thought ever crossed Biden's mind, would far outweigh any gain.</p><p>Effectively firing the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-11-07/harris-vice-president">first female, first Black</a> and first Asian American vice president would risk <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-19/harris-struggles-create-bind-democrats">a serious backlash</a> from the Democratic base  especially Black women, who were crucial to Biden's election.</p><p>Harris "was on the ticket for a reason. They won in 2020 for a reason," said Aimee Allison, the founder and head of She the People, an organization that works to empower women of color. Come 2024, she noted, "it's still the same dynamic."</p><p>Pushing Harris aside "would definitely ricochet through Black America"  and not in a good way, agreed </p> Aprill Turner<p>, a spokeswoman for Higher Heights for America, a group that advocates for Black women in politics.</p><p>In 1976, facing a stiff election fight, President </p>Gerald <p>Ford chose to replace Vice President Nelson Rockefeller as a way to bolster his standing with restive conservatives. Even with a </p>new  different <p>running mate, Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, Ford lost, and he came to regret the move.</p><p>Voters have consistently shown their focus is on the top of the ticket, not the No. 2 position.</p><p>Good or bad, the vice president can generally be summed up in a single word: afterthought.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
