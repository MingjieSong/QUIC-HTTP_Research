One of the photos shows a stack of boxes that had fallen over in a storage room. Visible in the photo are documents marked with a designation that the information can only be released to the closest allies of the U.S.: Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Trump is charged with willful retention of national defense information; conspiracy to obstruct justice; withholding a document or record; corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation; scheming to conceal; and false statements and representations.</p><p>In a brief televised statement, Smith urged the public to read the indictment in order to understand "the gravity of the crimes charged." He also said he was aiming for a speedy trial.</p><p>The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our armed forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people. Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States and they must be enforced, Smith said. "We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone."</p><p>The indictment details accusations that in two instances in 2021, Trump shared classified information with people who lacked security clearances. The indictment also confirms a CNN report on the existence of a recording in which Trump indicates understanding that he cannot declassify records after leaving office and acknowledges that he possesses a classified record.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ff/67/601cc6bf424a8d142cb521c10425/trump-classified-documents-39430.jpg"></figure><p>The investigation began after the National Archives found classified records in a batch of documents Trump returned </p> in 2022,<p> a year after leaving office. Justice Department officials then sought a subpoena demanding that he return any other classified material in his possession. </p><p>The indictment cites notes from a May 23</p> , 2022, <p>conversation between Trump and his lawyer Evan Corcoran in which the former president questioned whether he had to fully comply with the subpoena, including making the statements, "I don't want anybody looking through my boxes. I don't want you looking through my boxes," "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?" and, "Well look, isn't it better if there are no documents?"</p><p>Trumps legal team ultimately produced about three dozen additional documents and a letter stating that a diligent search had turned up nothing more. But the indictment says Trump's lawyers didn't have access to all of the records for their search. </p><p>The indictment states that between May 23 and June 2 of last year  during the window after the subpoena was issued but before Corcoran could review the documents  Trump had his personal aide Waltine "Walt" Nauta move 64 boxes out of the Mar-a-Lago storage room to Trump's residence so the former president could go through the contents, and that Nauta later returned only 30 boxes to the storage room. This was hidden from Corcoran, according to the indictment.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e0/49/16c4128d448090e5829c95f52047/aptopix-trump-classified-documents-23595.jpg"></figure><p>The Justice Department learned of the move and the possibility that classified documents remained at the estate, and gained judicial approval for a search warrant. More than <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-02/judge-unseals-detailed-inventory-of-mar-a-lago-search">100 documents with classified markings were found</a> during an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago that August. The indictment states that the recovered classified records came from the CIA, the Defense Department, the National Security Agency and the State Department, among other sources.</p><p>Nauta was indicted alongside Trump on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation, scheming to conceal and making false statements and representations.</p><p>Trump defended Nauta, a Navy veteran who was frequently by his side in the White House, in a Truth Social post before the indictment was made public.</p><p>"He has done a fantastic job! They are trying to destroy his life, like the lives of so many others, hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump,' the former president said of Nauta.</p><p>The special counsel's investigation has focused in part on Nauta, who is reportedly seen on surveillance video helping a maintenance worker move boxes from the storage room before the FBI executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>According to the indictment, Nauta made multiple false statements, including saying he was not aware the boxes had been taken to Trumps residence for review before 15 of them were sent to the National Archives, and didn't know how boxes taken to a National Archives truck had come to be in the residence; and that he falsely denied knowing where the boxes had been stored before they were found in Trumps residence, saying, I wish I could tell you. I dont know. I dont  I honestly just dont know.</p><p>Trump announced<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-08/trump-special-counsel-indictment-classified-documents"> in a social media post Thursday</a> that he had been indicted in connection with his handling of the records and had been ordered to appear in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. The indictment comes nearly a year after more than 100 documents with classified markings were found during the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The case appears to have been initially directed toward U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who handled his lawsuit last year over the FBI search. Cannons <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-12-01/appeals-court-special-master-trump-documents">decision to appoint a special master</a> to review materials seized in the search delayed the investigation for several weeks.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and claimed again late Thursday that he was innocent. On Friday he announced that he was shaking up his legal team, replacing attorneys Jim Trusty and John Rowley with New York-based Todd Blanche and a firm to be named later. Blanche is assisting with Trump's other indictment on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-03-30/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels">34 felony charges related to an alleged hush money payment</a> to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Trusty and Rowley said in a joint statement that they had resigned, calling it a logical moment to leave because the case had moved to Miami.</p><p>Trump and his allies quickly framed the new indictment as an attempt to diminish him as a political opponent, with some such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) misrepresenting the legal process.</p><p>"If the people in power can jail their political opponents at will, we dont have a republic," Hawley, a lawyer and former state attorney general, tweeted.</p><p>Such claims disregard that it was a grand jury that recommended the charges based on evidence presented to it, and that it will be a jury that decides Trump's guilt or innocence on the charges based on the evidence provided in court.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Once Donald Trump had received a formal target letter from the department, his fate was effectively sealed.</p><p>But that was only the latest in a series of recent signs that charges were inevitable. The months and years of questions about whether the Biden administration should or would indict the 45th and would-be next president  and whether the department would stay its hand for politics, the good of the republic or some other reason  were settled when Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel.</p><p>From that point on, the investigation of the former president's retention of classified documents has followed the well-worn path that the federal government would tread for any defendant accused of behavior anywhere close to as brazen as Trump's over the last two years. Smith pursued the case as he would have any other, and that led ineluctably to the indictment unsealed Friday.</p><p>Almost as unavoidably, it will also lead to the department urging a court to impose significant prison time on the former president if he is convicted. Trump's last chance to bargain for less grave charges came and went in his lawyers last meeting with Justice officials on Monday. Now he is in the unenviable position of any other defendant charged with such serious crimes.</p> Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">     37-count indictment  </a></p>  includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal. The government alleges that Trump willfully kept sensitive information about U.S. and foreign defense capabilities and shared classified information with people who did not have security clearances. It also charges a conspiracy to obstruct justice involving Trump and his valet Walt Nauta, who reportedly <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/18/walt-nauta-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-witness/" target="_blank">     lied to FBI agents about the presence of sensitive documents,  </a></p>  only to fess up during subsequent questioning. Nauta, who was also charged, is likely to be an important government witness  and, given his long-standing loyalty to Trump, a very credible one. The indictment also confirms that former Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran will be another important government witness, perhaps the most important. He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The relocation of the unprecedented case from Washington, D.C., to Florida is likely to make the case that much stronger. Although it may sound like a procedural detail, a defendant has a constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried where a crime was allegedly committed. A venue mistake could result in consequences as serious as a case being thrown out with no opportunity for retrial. So the department made the strategic call that the case should proceed in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and the scene of his allegedly illegal record retention.</p> And  though we learned  only this week of much of the activity there, it appears as if a grand jury has been sitting in Florida for several weeks. That's more than long enough for it to absorb previous testimony in the case, which the department could provide by briefing jurors on what happened in the capital.<p>The location also has the effect of underscoring the most damning aspect of the case for Trump. His </p> knowingly<p> taking documents from the White House was almost certainly criminal; his brazen and quintessentially Trumpian refusal to return them, even to the point of lying to the government and involving others in the concealment, was worse.</p>Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">37-count indictment</a></p> includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal.

He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The venue does heighten the risk that an ardently pro-Trump juror will simply refuse to convict him on any grounds, which given the mind-boggling strength of the evidence might be the defendant's only hope. But the justice system has already proved resilient, having produced another indictment of the ex-president, in New York, and an unfavorable civil verdict in the E. Jean Carroll case. </p><p>With the venue issue put to rest, and with courts in the Florida district known for moving fairly quickly, a trial is likely to unfold sooner if the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/aileen-cannon-trump-judge.html" target="_blank">Trump-appointed judge</a> initially assigned to the case doesn't cause unforeseen delays. Its even possible that Trump will be convicted by a federal jury before the 2024 election, for which he remains the overwhelmingly </p> favored<p> front-runner for the Republican nomination, though his appeals would probably continue.</p><p>The Department of Justice has shown the </p> necessary<p> steeliness and dedication to make history in undertaking this prosecution of a former president. And with Smith still investigating Trump's even more outrageous misconduct on and before Jan. 6, 2021, </p> this <p>first such prosecution may well not be the last. </p><p>Next week, meanwhile, Smith's deputies are expected to take their places at the table near the jury box in a federal courtroom and announce their appearance on behalf of the people in United States vs. Trump. Whatever else happens in the coming months, it's a proud moment and a banner achievement for the rule of law in this country.</p>Harry Litman is the host of the&nbsp;<p><a href="https://www.talkingfeds.com/">Talking Feds podcast</a></p>.&nbsp;<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrylitman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@harrylitman</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

And what does that mean when it does come?</p><p>A new study provides a possible answer  the drying <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-11-29/u-s-government-pledges-250-million-to-help-ailing-salton-sea">Salton Sea</a>, about 150 miles southeast of L.A., and the lack of sudden, major floodwaters funneling into it since it formed more than a century ago.</p><p>But one thing is certain. The drought of earthquakes on the San Andreas fault will not last. A drying Salton Sea may be helping delay the next Big One, but that could result in a more powerful quake when it does strike.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06058-9" target="_blank">study</a> published </p> Wednesday<p> in the journal Nature by scientists at San Diego State University and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego aimed to help explain why the southernmost tip of the San Andreas fault, close to the Mexican border, hasn't had an earthquake of a magnitude 7 or greater in about 300 years.</p><p>That's an unusually long gap. Other sections of the San Andreas have ruptured more recently. A section between Monterey County and San Bernardino County ruptured 166 years ago</p>1857<p>, and another portion ruptured in the great San Francisco earthquake 117 years ago</p>1906<p>.</p><p>In this southernmost section of the San Andreas, there have been seven major earthquakes between the 10th and 18th centuries. Some were probably separated by only a 40- or 50-year gap. For others, the gaps were probably as long as 280 years.</p><p>But it's been about three centuries  sometime between 1721 and 1731  since a temblor that was at least a magnitude 7 struck the southernmost section of the San Andreas.</p><p>"Yet we know that this portion of the fault has accumulated enough tectonic strain to produce such an event," said Ryley G. Hill, a doctoral candidate in geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and San Diego State who was lead author of the study. "And so this area actually poses the largest seismic hazard in all of California because it <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-07/devastating-turkey-earthquake-has-urgent-lessons-for-california">could severely damage the Los Angeles metropolitan area</a>." </p><p>A plausible earthquake that begins at the Salton Sea and ruptures through Palm Springs, continuing to Los Angeles County, is known as the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-06/earthquake-like-turkeys-would-devastate-southern-california">ShakeOut scenario</a>. That envisions a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that could result in 1,800 deaths and nearly 50,000 injuries  the deadliest quake in modern Southern California history. More than 1,000 of those deaths could occur in L.A. County alone. </p><p>So what could explain this unusually long quiet period?</p><p>Before the Salton Sea began to form in 1905  the result of both <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340038533_Formation_of_California's_Salton_Sea_in_1905-07_was_not_accidental" target="_blank">human and natural causes</a>  the low-lying Salton Trough, which sits below sea level, cycled over thousands of years between filling with water from the Colorado River and drying out.</p><p>The ancient predecessor to the Salton Sea is now referred to as Lake Cahuilla, which, when full, was 40 times larger in volume than its modern-day remnant. Lake Cahuilla was so vast that it stretched from the Coachella Valley south into Mexico and from as far west as Plaster City, Calif., to as far east as the Chocolate Mountains, according to study co-author Thomas Rockwell, a professor of geology at San Diego State.</p><p>A full Lake Cahuilla reached an elevation of about 40 feet above sea level, with a maximum depth of more than 300 feet before it started to spill again. By contrast, the Salton Sea currently<b> </b>reaches a <a href="https://www.iid.com/water/salton-sea#:~:text=With%20the%20high%20evaporation%20rates,feet%20below%20mean%20sea%20level." target="_blank">height</a> of about 240 feet below sea level, and with a maximum <a href="https://saltonsea.jpl.nasa.gov/site-description#:~:text=Salton%20Sea%20is%20approximately%2060,many%20species%20of%20migratory%20birds." target="_blank">depth</a> of about 50 feet.</p><p>Researchers found a pattern of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/colorado-river-in-crisis">Colorado River waters</a> pouring into Lake Cahuilla and accompanying large earthquakes before the lake periodically dried up. Lake Cahuilla is believed to have been full six times in the last millennium</p> : roughly  between the periods of 930 to 966, 1007 to 1070, 1192 to 1241, 1486 to 1503, 1618 to 1636, and 1731 to 1733<p>. </p><p>"By looking at the earthquake history, and its relationship to the lakes, we realize that most of the earthquakes have occurred when a lake was present," Rockwell said. </p><p>Of the seven major quakes researchers found, six occurred when Lake Cahuilla either was filling up or was at a peak level. </p>And  of the six times the lake filled during this period, all were accompanied by major quakes. <p>"Although previous studies were inconclusive about the temporal correlation of the earthquakes and lake episodes over the past millennium, the new earthquake history strongly suggests that all lake-filling events were accompanied by large earthquakes," the study said. "Such a correlation between the earthquake and lake timings is probably not coincidental."</p><p>The central reason <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-12/earthquake-science-definitions-causes-effects">why earthquakes occur</a> remains the same: </p>strain that <p>Strain has accumulated for decades or centuries because of tectonic plate movement, and the fault suddenly ruptures. Such a quake would've inevitably happened whether Lake Cahuilla was there or not. But its periodic refilling may have been the tipping point that triggered earthquakes when they did occur.</p><p>The decline of the Salton Sea, however, does not mean Southern California will forever be protected against a San Andreas earthquake as long as that area is </p>dessicating desiccating<p>. </p><p>"The idea that letting the Salton Sea dry up will keep us safe from earthquakes is definitely the wrong takeaway," said </p> Belle Philibosian<p>, a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who wasn't affiliated with the study. </p><p>"Even if this ancient Lake Cahuilla or the Salton Sea never existed, these earthquakes would still eventually have happened anyway. They just happened a little bit sooner than they otherwise would have, due to the influence of the filling and emptying of the lakes over time," Philibosian said. "Even if the Salton Sea dries up completely, that next southern San Andreas earthquake is still going to happen. And we still need to be prepared for it."</p><p>Scientists have also noticed other examples in which the filling of reservoirs brought earthquake faults closer to failure, possibly advancing temblors, the study said. </p> A report published in 1997 <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s000240050089" target="_blank">     noted  </a></p>  that seismicity "is likely to be more widespread and deeper for a larger reservoir than for a smaller one."  One documented example, cited in a study <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/C-Scholz-2/publication/279695807_Two_types_of_reservoir-induced_seismicity/links/59f46772a6fdcc075ec373ca/Two-types-of-reservoir-induced-seismicity.pdf" target="_blank">     published  </a></p>  in 1988, involved the Koyna dam in western India. The reservoir behind the dam began to fill in 1962; five years later, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck, resulting in damage to the dam and a nearby town, and 200 people were killed. More recently, some scientists have <p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812436/" target="_blank">     suggested  </a></p>  the filling of the Zipingpu reservoir in China could plausibly have helped advance the timing of the devastating magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Sichuan in 2008, which <p><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usp000g650/impact" target="_blank">     killed  </a></p>  more than 69,000 people. It's unclear whether the new reservoir directly triggered the initial rupture of that quake. But scientists suggested it could have helped a small rupture along the fault to trigger larger ruptures elsewhere. In addition, earthquakes have been <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-man-made-quakes-20150424-story.html">     associated  </a></p>  with the injection, deep underground, of wastewater  left over from fracking operations to extract oil and natural gas.<p>Such activities increase something called pore pressure  essentially, increasing the fluids between the grains of a rock. "So if you have a rock and you fully saturate it with water, the pore pressure in it will increase due to the fluid inside it," Hill said. And that weakens the earthquake fault, making it more likely to rupture.</p><p>Increasing pore pressure is similar to turning on an air hockey table, Hill said. Low pore pressure would be like trying to nudge the puck when the table is off  it's harder, but you can still move it. Higher pore pressure would be like when the table is on, meaning it's much easier for the puck to move when given the same amount of push.</p><p>"That's exactly what the lake is doing. ... It's basically unclamping" the two sides of the fault, making them easier to move, resulting in an earthquake, Hill said. </p><p>That there isn't </p> a massive Lake Cahuillamuch of a lake<p> in this part of California anymore could mean more seismic strain is accumulating before it could rupture in a quake. That could make it possible for a larger magnitude event when an earthquake actually occurs. </p><p>"We could potentially have a much larger event, because more stress could be released," Hill said. </p> The last big earthquake in this area on the San Andreas caused one part of the fault to move past the other by 12 to 14 feet, making it a likely magnitude 7.3 or 7.4 earthquake. Rockwell said he expected the next one to be larger because it will have been at least 300 years since the last quake, with one side of the fault potentially moving past the other by 16 feet or so, or making it a magnitude 7.5. An open question is how much farther the San Andreas would rupture. Rarely, earthquakes from this area will rupture the fault not only through the Salton Trough and Coachella Valley regions, but propagate farther north, toward Riverside and San Bernardino.  "So one of the big questions is, if we have a large earthquake, will it potentially cascade to the north and produce an even larger earthquake," going through Los Angeles County and potentially all the way to the southern edge of Monterey County, Rockwell said.  The forming of the Salton Sea at the turn of the last century was small in comparison to the flows that previously filled ancient Lake Cahuilla. Nonetheless, the rapid increase of water flow into the newly forming body of water may have helped trigger a magnitude 6.1 earthquake in Brawley on April 18, 1906, Hill said. Scientists have previously suggested that quake was distantly triggered by the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which occurred 11 hours after the event in Northern California.  The Salton Sea has long been fed by Colorado River water draining from the farmlands in the Imperial Valley. The lake has been shrinking since the early 2000s, when the local irrigation district began transferring a portion of its water to urban areas. Its water is now about twice as salty as the ocean and continues to get saltier with evaporation, a shift that has caused <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/88077367-132.html">major declines in fish</a> and bird populations</p> . Based on current trends, the lake is projected to continue shrinking in the coming years. Along the retreating shorelines, state officials have been working on projects to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-11-29/u-s-government-pledges-250-million-to-help-ailing-salton-sea">control dust</a></p>  and build wetlands to provide wildlife habitat. A state-appointed panel last year <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-05/panel-rejects-idea-of-filling-salton-sea-with-ocean-water">     recommended against   </a></p> the idea of importing seawater to stop the Salton Sea from shrinking. The panel concluded that California shouldnt pursue such a plan, citing costs estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, harm to the coastal environment and a construction timeline that would take many years before any water would reach the lake. Advocates of importing water to the Salton Sea have strongly criticized the panel's conclusions, arguing the analysis was faulty.Times staff writer Ian James contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Although I had been aroused by men since I was 13, I told myself that I would only come out when I had</p>  deep<p> feelings for another man. </p> Back then,<p> I had never experienced the feeling of having a crush before  the sense of being unable to get someone out of your head and constantly fantasizing about a</p>  future<p> life together. Without that feeling, </p> I realized that I <p>couldn't admit that I was&nbsp;gay</p>  to myself    or to  and everyone else.<p>That night </p> I met Griffin   , <p> I experienced those feelings for the first time. I couldn't stop looking at him from across the dance floor. Not only was he physically perfect, with a sharp jawline and gorgeous eyelashes, he also embodied the person I wanted to be  openly&nbsp;gay&nbsp;and accepted into a large group of male friends. </p> That was <p>something I had never had before. I wanted him and immediately wanted to be him.</p><p>At the time, I was living in my sister's apartment, sleeping in her guest bedroom. She was traveling with her boyfriend. </p> Thankfully her apartment<p> was a short distance from the nightclub. I found Griffin later, and we ended up spending the night together.</p><p>After that, I knew I was&nbsp;gay,&nbsp;and it was time to come out of the closet. I fantasized about dating him, but there was just one problem: He was leaving for the summer and going home to Texas. </p> However, that didn't stop me from being<p> completely into him.</p><p>I was already planning to transfer from Santa Monica </p>Community <p>College to USC in the fall. I had always set my sights on USC, but now there was an even bigger reason to enroll. I wanted Griffin's life  to be popular and openly&nbsp;gay&nbsp;in a top-tier college fraternity. And, of course, I wanted him. He was all I could think about that summer.</p><p>In August, I walked up the steps of his fraternity house for the first day of rush. My </p> hands palms <p>were shaking as I thought about how our second interaction would go. I found him standing in </p> Lambda Chi Alpha's<p> stained</p> ,<p> beer-smelling party atrium and </p> chatting<p> with some of the other rushees.</p><p>"Hi, Griffin," I said, hands in my pockets to hide my nervousness.</p><p>"Tanner!" he replied as if he hadnt seen me in ages. "How are you?"</p><p>We engaged in small talk until the small talk became too trivial.&nbsp;Well, it was good&nbsp;seeing you, I said.</p><p>At the end of rush, I joined another fraternity, one that fit my personality better. </p> Considered the <p>first openly&nbsp;gay&nbsp;brother in </p> Tau Kappa Epsilon at USC<p>, I finally felt accepted by a large group of men  something I had always wanted but never experienced during adolescence.</p><p>I obsessed over Griffin throughout sophomore year. We would run into each other at parties and off-campus bars. A few times we ended up going home together, but I was always too nervous to ask for anything more.</p><p>Looking back, he probably could tell that I was infatuated with him. I could hardly get words out when speaking to him unless I was incredibly drunk, at which point I would not so subtly follow him around whatever venue I found him </p> in<p>.</p><p>During junior year, I hardly saw him. Our paths rarely crossed. He had a boyfriend and went abroad, and I took a step back from Greek life to recover from the bad habits I had picked up during my </p> previous<p> year as a fraternity degenerate. (Let's just say that I needed therapy more than I needed a man.)</p><p>Fast</p> -<p>forward to senior year. One night during first semester, I slept over at my Delta Gamma friend's house where she lived with six other </p> women<p>. I woke up beside her in the middle of the night and then went downstairs to get a glass of water only to find Griffin there in the kitchen. He was fresh out of his relationship</p> ,<p> and he was with a female friend of his </p> who that <p>lived in the house. </p><p>It was </p> 1one<p> in the morning, and they had just returned from a night out. As much as I told myself it wasn't worth getting involved with him again, I couldn't resist when he asked me to come home with him.</p><p>"Where are you going?" my friend asked when I went back upstairs to grab my belongings from her bedside.</p><p>"Can't sleep," I said. "Gonna walk home." I lived up the street</p> ,<p> and I didn't want to admit to a hookup that even she knew would stir up feelings. And it did.</p><p>Griffin and I shared a few more nights together that semester. At the start of the second semester, I finally told him how I felt. If he wasn't ready to at least take me on a date, I needed to move on.</p><p>We went on that date and had&nbsp;wine on my roof while we asked each other questions about life. Both of us smiled between each answer. That was three years ago, and we've been happily together ever since.</p>The author is writing his debut novel, "Tales of a Gay Frat Star."

Find ideas and inspiration on where to go, what to eat and how to enjoy life on the weekends.<p>Many know Jaren Lewison as nerdy high-schooler Ben, whose relationship with classmate Devi went from frenemies to lovers on Netflixs <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-05-06/netflix-never-have-i-ever-mindy-kaling-immigrant-los-angeles">Never Have I Ever</a>. But off-screen, Lewison is a recent graduate of USC who loves to bake, play video games, hit the gym, eat like a king and wander around nostalgic places. </p><p>"Sometimes you become slightly desensitized to how magical [L.A.] can feel, said Lewison, who still lives in South Central near the USC campus after finishing school a year early. </p><p>With "Never Have I Ever" returning for its fourth and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-03-08/never-have-i-ever-netflix-season-4-mindy-kaling">final</a> season this week,</p>JUNE 8<p> Lewison takes us through some of the spots he's enjoyed with his friends and the show's cast and crew. Heres how hed spend a perfect Sunday in L.A.</p><p><b>9:30 a.m.: Pop out of bed</b></p><p>My alarm is at 9:30 a.m. every day. My family says we have the Lewison curse, which means you just never sleep. I'm also the type of person where my alarm goes off and I'm out of bed 30 seconds later, brushing my teeth.</p><p><b>9:45 a.m.: Head to the gym</b></p><p>I grab a protein bar and walk to the <b>USC Lyon Recreation Center</b>, which is where I work out. Im about to move, but for the last four years  my entire time being out in L.A.  I've lived and gone to school at USC. I graduated a year ago, but I'm still sort of living the college life. All my friends are still here and a lot of them are from out of state, so I was like, you know what? Ill spend one more year with my friends. </p><p><b>12 p.m.: Snack time</b></p><p>Then I'll come home, shower and I'll make the best protein shake of all time. I use this protein powder that's chocolate-flavored, the brand is Dymatize. I get two scoops of peanut butter in there and then some oat milk. I'm telling you, it tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Then, in a perfect world, I'm gonna make some Oreo cookie brownie bars to enjoy after dinner. I'm a big baker. I have a massive sweet tooth.</p><p><b>1 p.m.: Get lunch at the </b><a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/" target="_blank"><b>Original Farmers Market</b></a></p><p>I'm going to the <b>Ffarmers mMarket </b>at <b>Tthe</b> <b>Grove</b>. When I was a kid, I would come to L.A. for pilot season and I would eat at the farmers market with my mom and then drive to an audition.</p><p>Lunch is gonna be with my roommates, who are my best friends. I might have a corned beef sandwich at one of the deli spots. I might do the kebab stand. I might do the fried chicken place. I like to eat, so it could be that I go get a pickle from the <a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/merchants/kaylin-and-kaylin-pickles" target="_blank">little pickle guy stand</a>, or at least a sample. I'd probably get a fresh squeezed lemonade. I would like to say I can control myself, but I probably can't.</p><p><b>2 p.m.: Pick out a new book</b></p><p>Then I'm probably walking around <b>Barnes &amp; Noble</b>. I was never a reader growing up but after college, I was like, I want to read. I really like realistic fiction or sci-fi. Growing up, "Ender's Game" was like the only thing I ever read besides Percy Jackson and like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent"  whatever was popular. But recently, I read all of Sally Rooney's books. And I really liked those  I'm a huge fan of Normal People. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal, their performances [in "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six"] are mind-boggling to me and that's one of my favorite limited series. So right now, I'm reading "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six." I guess if it gets adapted into a TV show, I'm like, oh, I should do it.</p><p><b>2:30 p.m.: Wander around a museum&nbsp;</b></p><p>It might be the<b> Broad</b>. It might be the<b> Academy Museum of Motion Pictures</b>. I've been wanting to go to the <b>Petersen Automotive Museum</b>, so I'm probably gonna go there with my friends. I have a dream of owning a raven black Thunderbird, like a 1957 with chrome, red interior, and it's a convertible.</p><p>It's a very silly vision, but in my mind, when I've made it, I've got that car, I'm in a black suit with a black dress shirt with Ray-Ban sunglasses. The top is down and I'm driving down PCH to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqR1cjuPXUg&amp;ab_channel=ColterWall-Topic">The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie</a>. So I think that the Petersen Automotive Museum might be the closest I ever get to sitting in that car and driving on PCH while that song plays, but we'll see, you never know.</p><p><b>4:30 p.m.: Get an afternoon cone</b></p><p>My family has a tradition: we used to do 3 o'clock ice cream on vacations. I'm going to <b>McConnell's Fine Ice Creams</b> and as dark chocolate as it can get, that's what I want. My family is in Dallas, but I'll send them a picture in our family group chat.</p><p><b>5 p.m.: Head home to play Rocket League</b></p><p>My little group of seven will probably have a couple of drinks and we like to play <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>. That's a big one in my house, we do some tournaments. My Rocket League partner, Dan, is one of my best friends. We've definitely figured out how to get some chemistry going on the Rocket League field.</p><p><b>7:15 p.m.: Eat as much meat as humanly possible </b></p><p>We're going to K-Town. I love Korean barbecue, I'm probably eating my face off. We're gonna have some beer, we're gonna have all the meat, maybe some of the fixings, but definitely a lot of meat. I'll probably be the grill master.</p><p>The first [Korean barbecue joint] that I was ever exposed to was <b>Gyu-Kaku</b>, which is really solid. But there are a couple of gems in K-town. Every time I go, I try a new place. <b>Quarters Korean BBQ</b> is really, really good. I actually went there with the "Never Have I Ever" crew and cast.</p><p><b>9:30 p.m.: Choose an adventure </b></p><p>There are a few options now. We could do karaoke in K-town. Im a Texas boy. I am not a singer, but I think I can sing a country song and be all right. I think it's gonna be "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker. One time, my roommate and I went up for karaoke and sang "My Way" by Frank Sinatra, and I do think that brought the house down.</p><p>Or perhaps an escape room. Or we're going back to my house, and it's a game night. My house is a Settlers of Catan house. We actually have a chalkboard wall and we have a winner's standings column that gets updated after every game.</p><p><b>12 a.m.: Grab a midnight snack at Canters</b></p><p>At this point, it might be time to go to <b>Canter's Deli</b>. I'm a huge Jewish deli person and Canter's is open 24 hours, so I'm gonna milk the hell out of that. </p>So I'm probably getting the corned beef sandwich. And then I think bedtime is around 1:30 a.m.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The other, Jeff Ranen, recalled giving a rousing Jerry Maguire speech to convince colleagues to follow him out the door.</p><p>But over the weekend, Lewis Brisbois struck back. </p><p>In an extraordinary move, its management team directed the release of scores of emails in which Barber and Ranen used vile terms for women, Black people, Armenians, Persians, and gay men and traded in offensive stereotypes of Jews and Asians. In one fell swoop, the venerable firm managed to torpedo its new rival, destroy the defecting partners careers and send the legal establishment reeling.</p><p>The emails, stretching back 15 years, were head-spinning in their coarseness and vitriol. A Superior Court judge was called Sugar </p>Tits <p>Ts. Multiple female lawyers were referred to as "c</p>t<p>." The epithets fag and faggot were deployed as all-purpose insults. An Asian job applicant was denigrated for the supposed size of his genitalia. Ranen dismissed another job candidate with, How about someone whos not a Jew.</p><p>By Monday, the emails had been excerpted by the New York Post and the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, and the nascent firm Barber Ranen had collapsed.</p><p>"The last 72 hours have been the most difficult of our lives, as we have had to acknowledge and reckon with those emails," Barber and Ranen said in a joint statement announcing their resignations. "We are ashamed of the words we wrote, and we are deeply sorry."</p><p>Barber Ranens chief executive Tim Graves, a former Lewis Brisbois attorney, said in a statement that the remaining partners will form a new firm and asked for support while we heal and plan our path forward.</p><p>The roster of lawyers was stripped from the Barber Ranen website, and some had already asked for their old jobs back at Lewis Brisbois, a spokesperson said.</p><p>It was not all good news for the firm. Some saw the email release as a self-own for Lewis Brisbois, revealing a culture of bigotry thriving in some corners of the behemoth firm. Many objectionable messages were copied to co-workers, from junior associates to fellow partners.</p><p>I just dont understand that, said Ann Park, a corporate litigator and president of the L.A. County Bar Assn. It just reflects poorly on  obviously these lawyers  but also on their colleagues for not calling it out.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois recently retained a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to review internal practices, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>The men writing the emails were not junior employees, but influential veterans and supervisors. Barber was a member of the firms management committee, which governs its nearly 1,700 attorneys in 55 offices around the country, and Ranen had been the youngest person to make partner, according to his former firm biography. Both helped run its labor and employment practice, defending corporations against harassment and discrimination lawsuits.</p><p>Though the departure they instigated in early May represented about 8% of the firms lawyers, it came on top of an exodus earlier in the year of 30 others. Within days, the firms 87-year-old chair, Bob Lewis, who had founded it in 1979, stepped aside for a rejiggered management team.</p><p>Meanwhile, Barber and Ranens new practice was attracting positive coverage in legal news outlets. According to Lewis Brisbois, it was during this time that the firm received an anonymous complaint about the former partners. It specifically recommended the firm scrutinize the emails of both men, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Firm managers launched an investigation and were shocked to find dozens of emails  with unacceptable, prejudiced language aimed at our colleagues, clients, attorneys from other firms, and even judges, the firm said in a statement.</p><p>The firms leaders consulted ethics experts who laid out a variety of options: publish the emails on the Lewis Brisbois website; share the emails with partners at Barber and Ranens new firm; and file a complaint with the State Bar of California, which licenses attorneys, according to the person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Ultimately, firm leaders chose to provide the media with a curated, partly redacted set of correspondence  a decision that was presented as transparency and which many in the legal field saw as revenge delivered ice cold.</p><p>Scott Cummings, a UCLA law professor who teaches ethics, said that there was no legal requirement that the firm make the emails public, but that it was the ethically correct thing to do because it informed prospective employees and clients of the repugnant views the men held.</p><p>Bringing these things to light does go toward protecting the public and alerting the profession to conduct that should be stopped, Cummings said. Even if Lewis Brisbois was motivated by vengeance, he said, the benefits to the field and the public still stood. These things can happen simultaneously.</p><p>Barber and Ranen practiced in an area where company email accounts are routinely mined for evidence, and racist, sexist or other bigoted messages can translate to costly settlements or verdicts.</p><p>Yet both men appeared to revel in their flagrant disregard for professionalism and decency. In 2013, Ranen told Barber that if you want to have fun for a second, he should keyword search the words c and Jew on your email inbox and sent box.</p><p>It's like you know me, Barber replied.</p><p>The pair injected mundane work correspondence with antisemitism. Ranen repeatedly used Jew as a synonym for haggling over prices: I might be able to Jew them down to $390, he wrote in 2016. When Ranen alerted colleagues to bagels he had brought to the office in 2014, Barber replied, Jew c.</p><p>In a boasting 2012 email, Ranen told Barber, Gypsy is my new word to describe about half of the minorities in California. Generally with an Armo, Persian or middle eastern flair.</p><p>Over the next decade, Ranen invoked the gypsy moniker repeatedly to mock several attorneys, prompting one</p>  fellow colleague<p> at Lewis Brisbois to </p> confide in him <p>last year, Dirty Gypsy is my new favorite epithet.</p><p>Sex was another frequent topic. After a friend promised a 2015 trip to Las Vegas where debauchery level is unprecedented, Ranen said he would get a continuance in a federal trial to attend and informed others accompanying him, Were going to a strip club or bringing in hookers.</p><p>When a female lawyer asked for upgrades to the firm lactation room, Ranen forwarded it to a male colleague with speculation about her appearance after bearing two children. He then added, She could be 200 pounds and acne scarred and after all this time Id still f her.</p><p>The emails also include a seemingly gratuitous use by Barber of the n-word. After a colleague informed him that another participant in a 2013 mediation objected to the word being spoken, Barber replied, Got it. He then spelled out the word.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois redacted the names of many individuals who participated in the odious conversations, but the names of some maligned are visible. One is Linda Miller Savitt, an employment lawyer at a rival law firm who Ranen described as a real c in a 2018 email to two other lawyers.</p><p>Its very disappointing to learn this about colleagues, even if they are competitors, she told The Times. Savitt represents the newspaper in employment litigation.</p><p>Jonathan Delshad, an attorney who opposed Lewis Brisbois in a 2016 case, found out from The Times on Tuesday that Ranen had written of him to a co-worker, Tell him that hes the reason why most people hate Jews.</p><p>I make it a point not to get caught up in personal disputes, Delshad said, adding, I do my best to treat every human being with dignity and respect regardless of our position on a legal dispute.</p><p>Merle Vaughn, an attorney and legal recruiter specializing in finding diverse candidates, said that the emails raised the question of what office life had been like for women and minorities.</p><p>If they were putting that in writing, what were the quote-unquote microaggressions they had to endure to keep their job, said Vaughn, the managing partner in the L.A. office of Major, Lindsey &amp; Africa.</p><p>Their apparent comfort in putting offensive ideas in writing was evidence, she said, that they believe they are above it and they wont get caught.</p><p>Barber seemed to recognize as much. In 2015, he told an acquaintance, There is no NSFW for me, abbreviating "not safe for work."</p><p>"My average email would get someone fired," he added.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

On a breezy day in mid-May, just as tourist season was about to begin, the predominant theory among locals was that he was in a jail cell far from Eforie. Romanian TV stations said as much, but offered few details.</p><p>Another local news outlet reported the council member was "nowhere to be found."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/91/fb/0f833a8c4b1097c0575052f27795/virgil-negru.jpg"></figure><p>While his townspeople speculate</p> ,<p> Negru, 40, has spent the last </p> 69 days[as of 6/8]<p> in custody some 6,600 miles from home, in Ventura Countys Main Jail, accused of attempting to steal cash meant for low-income Californians.</p><p>Around 8 a.m. on April 1, Simi Valley police staking out an ATM arrested Negru, who allegedly possessed forged cards loaded with taxpayer funds. He is </p>one of <p>among dozens of Romanian citizens who have come to the region recently to steal cash and food stamp benefits, authorities say, lured by the large number of people on public assistance and weak security on the cards </p> that<p> the state uses to dole out the money.</p><p>Such crimes have surged in the last two years.

"It's just insane.</p> Since last spring<p>, at least 60 people  nearly all with connections to Romania  have been arrested or charged on suspicion of theft involving forged EBT cards in Southern California, according to court records and law enforcement officials. A Romanian court translator in the region says they've never had so much work.</p><p>The Romanian Consulate in Los Angeles declined to comment on the arrests, but said in an email that Romanian and American authorities had developed "a very efficient partnership and cooperate closely at many levels in order to fight any form of criminality."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/41/50/553ec0ee404499f0334ca9a47de7/photo-2023-05-15-13-16-502.jpg"></figure><p>Negru followed a familiar script, according to the Ventura County </p> d<p>istrict </p> a<p>ttorney's </p> o<p>ffice: He arrived at a Bank of America ATM within hours of the state transferring monthly cash benefits, armed with cloned EBT cards belonging to at least eight people. He was arrested before he could withdraw the money.</p><p>He has been charged with felony forgery and identity </p> theft fraud<p> and is being held in lieu of $150,000 bond</p> . He has pleaded guilty to the charge of felony identity theft<p>. He declined to comment through his lawyer.</p><p>His mother, Georgiana Negru, who until recently worked as a caregiver for seniors in Italy, </p> had<p> insisted he is simply out of town visiting family and friends.</p><p>If he had this money, earned so easily, would I still be going to Italy? she said, standing near the flower garden of her Eforie home. He wouldn't have done something to embarrass his family."</p><p>She said Negru's long stint abroad didnt seem unusual to her because he used to regularly go away for months at a time to visit people in foreign countries.</p><p>"Virgil has an army of friends, his mother said.</p> <b>::</b><p>The Mid-City Los Angeles rental already stood out from the rest of the homes on the street: boxy and modern with a bright orange trim.</p><p>When 13 FBI agents forced open the door at 6 a.m. May 4, 2022, the roomy four-bedroom resembled a skimming laboratory, an agent wrote in an affidavit.</p><p>The home</p> <p>was filled with computers, pinhole cameras and <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/safety-resources/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/skimming#:~:text=Skimming%20occurs%20when%20devices%20illegally,then%20steal%20from%20victims'%20accounts." target="_blank">skimmers</a>  thin, hard-to-spot machines that snap onto card readers and </p>are used to <p>steal personal information.

A search turned up roughly 1,400 forged cards of various types</p> , <p>according to the federal court indictment.</p> This was around the time cloned EBT cards came onto the radar of a high-tech crimes task force that draws from multiple local law enforcement agencies. Bank debit cards had become harder to copy as chips became standard. Cloned <p><a href="https://edd.ca.gov/en/about_edd/the_edd_debit_card/" target="_blank">     Employment Development Department cards  </a></p> , used to pilfer people's COVID-era unemployment benefits, were falling out of fashion to clone as the pandemic ebbed and the money dried up. By summer 2022, EBT cards had become the card fraud flavor of the month, said Geoffrey Elliott, an L.A. County Sheriff's Department detective and member of the task force. Unlike in past schemes, however, the victims were exclusively low-income people.<p>In the last six months of 2021, EBT fraud cost the state $3.2 million in stolen funds, with losses surging to $51.9 million for all of 2022. Those losses includes cash aid meant for low-income families with children, called <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks" target="_blank">CalWORKs,</a> and food stamps, known as <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh" target="_blank">CalFresh.</a> </p><p>In the first three months of this year, the total loss was $31.6 million.</p><p>In California, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-08/ebt-fraud-la-county">EBT theft victims</a> are supposed to be reimbursed for stolen money within two weeks of filling out the proper paperwork. But the wait times can </p>now <p>stretch for weeks as overwhelmed social service agencies try to wade through the </p>exploding <p>rising number of fraud claims.</p><p>Most of the theft takes place at ATMs by lower-level crime-ring members. But authorities say these operations have also found ways to turn stolen food stamp benefits into cash  by racking up exorbitant bills at grocery stores and </p>then <p>reselling what they buy.</p><p>This past fall, a Romanian couple spent roughly $110,000 in purloined food stamps across five trips to a downtown San Diego grocery store, according to a federal complaint. The couple allegedly spent as much as $26,312 in a single grocery store run  nearly all of it on pallets of Red Bull. </p><p>Paul Radu, a </p> Romanian<p> journalist who co-founded the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, dates the rise of Romanian skimming groups back to the early days of the internet.</p><p>The country has long had among the world's <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country">fastest internet speeds,</a> which in the 1990s gave criminals an advantage in the burgeoning world of online fraud.</p><p>Romanian organized crime groups have since come to dominate in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/card-skimming-fraud-snap-ebt/" target="_blank">billion-dollar skimming industry,</a> Radu said. </p><p>Right now, if you go to the dark web, what you can see is that there are batches of cloned cards that you can buy, he said in an interview.</p> <p>Three years ago, Radu's news outlet <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/how-a-crew-of-romanian-criminals-conquered-the-world-of-atm-skimming/the-riviera-maya-gang-global-atm-bandits/" target="_blank">exposed</a> a massive ATM skimming gang operating along the coast of Mexico. In that case, the groups came from the Romanian city of Craiova. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles recently charged two men from Craiova, </p>referred to described<p> in court documents as a known haven for ATM skimming crews."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3f/10/65bf2ec74ae89dda215a21ebd217/la-me-ebt-skimming01.jpg"></figure><p>All the men arrested in May 2022 at the Mid-City rental said they were from Transylvania, authorities said. A 24-year-old arrested at the house told a judge that he dreamed of coming to California for its cultural diversity, but once he got here found himself surrounded by the wrong people. Another man wrote that he was struggling to find work in Romania due to the influx of Ukrainians displaced by war</p>,<p> and desperately needed money for his newborn daughter.</p><p>Irvine-based attorney Brian Doyle said his client</p>,<p> Maria Vaduva, arrested near a Placentia ATM in March, was similarly desolate and trying to provide for her children. He said she was a<b> </b></p>clear <p>pawn in a </p>much more <p>complex operation. </p><p>Some higher-up clearly must have put themselves into her life</p>,<p> and induced her allegedly to assist a larger organization, Doyle said. Vaduva has pleaded not guilty to federal charges and is in custody.</p><p>Attorney Donald J. Matson in Pasadena said his client</p>,<p> Constantin Rotaru</p>,<p> was </p>himself <p>a victim of the scammers, having become accidentally entangled with the group on a visit to the United States. Rotaru also pleaded not guilty. </p><p>"My understanding is that at the coffee shops and other places that non-English speakers congregate, people approach speaking their language, and recruit them for the footwork part of the scheme," Matson said in an email. </p> Some of those arrested said they entered illegally through Mexico, according to court affidavits, while others claim to have chosen more unorthodox points of entry. Two men arrested near an ATM on March 1 said they made it from the Bahamas to Miami by boat. Another allegedly rode from Ontario, Canada, to Marine City, Mich., on a    J et    S ki. Once here, the crews operate in an "informal hierarchical structure"  various groups each with its their own leader  FBI Agent Rene Persaud wrote in an affidavit.  Decentralization is part of what has made Romanian skimming crews so difficult to tackle, said Louise Shelley, director of George Mason Universitys Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption <p><a href="https://traccc.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">     Center  </a></p> . If you have a network organization, where the people dont know each other, then they cant rat on each other, Shelley said. A sluggish bureaucracy  easily exploited by sophisticated criminals  hasn't helped   .  <p>Local public assistance advocates say they're frustrated with the state Department of Social Services, which has not publicly given a timeline of when chipped EBT card may be rolled out.</p><p>We all agree that there's no financial institution that would ever treat their money this way. They would never let it be lost this way. They'd be bankrupt, said Heather Tallent, an investigator with the Ventura County </p> d<p>istrict </p> a<p>ttorneys </p> o<p>ffice. So why is it not safeguarded?</p><p>Jason Montiel, a spokesperson for the agency, said a specific timeline is not available for implementing cards with chip technology. He said the department is actively working to develop and deploy the use of chip and tap technologies on EBT cards and </p>noted<p>that there are complex technological changes required to get it done.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/5d/19/fd2f89ff40f2ac1a6c5d4a32909c/evidence-skimming-arrest-2.jpg"></figure><p>In the meantime, local and federal authorities continue to make arrests, though some law enforcement officials say these arrests have </p> beenproven<p> a weak deterrent. Those facing state charges have usually been released on bail or on their own recognizance. Often, they<b> </b>disappear. </p><p>In September, </p>local <p>law enforcement staked out ATMs in the San Fernando Valley and central L.A. and made <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-07/ebt-fraud-scheme-los-angeles-california">16 arrests</a> in roughly 15 minutes, according to authorities.</p> <p>Half pleaded no contest and were sentenced to a month of community service and two years probation. </p><p>The rest of the group arrested in September ditched their ankle monitors and never showed up to court. </p> The Sheriff's Department says<p> a warrant is out for their arrest.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Two suspects arrested in Ventura County this March for EBT card theft similarly fled before their trials.</p><p>Their ankle monitors were </p>later <p>found in a field in Oxnard.</p> <b>::</b><p>For Virgil Negru, the costs mount as he enters month three in a California jail cell.</p><p>He lost his seat on the City Council for missing too many meetings. The local chapter of his political party recently suspended him. And hes vexed the towns politicians, who still dont understand exactly where their colleague has disappeared to.</p><p>I was surprised to hear the rumors that he was arrested  that's a rumor, now," said Antonela Tode, another member of the Eforie City Council. All I know is from TV.</p><p>When a reporter visited Eforie with Ventura County court documents showing his charges, a few constituents said they were puzzled how Negru had ended up jailed in a coastal city far from their own. They described the councilman as a decent politician.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/bd/dc/1e96756f4d1abc61998b9a11d483/photo-2023-05-15-13-16-506.jpg"></figure><p>Lcrmioara Vieru, who owns a cramped grocery store near the city hall, said he was on the people's side." One of her customers shopping for dish sponges and vegetables remembered Negru helping get central heating delivered to her social housing block.</p><p>Others described Negru as a middling politician, memorable  in the eyes of one resident  for driving around town with the mayor in a new Audi.</p><p>Lucia Srcil, 63, said she's known Negru for decades, most recently as a colleague on the City Council  sometimes quarrelsome, but usually well-intentioned.</p><p>Like the rest of Eforie, she has no idea how one of the towns top politicians ended up jailed in California, allegedly ensnared at the lowest rung of a criminal scheme.</p><p>"I didnt think he was capable of this," Srcil said. "We didn't expect this."</p>Radu is a special correspondent who reported from Eforie, Romania.

"El Nio winters also bring better chances for warmer-than-average temperatures across the northern tier of the country."</p><p>But human-caused climate change can exacerbate or mitigate some of its </p> effects,impacts, <p>L'Heureux said, including setting <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html">new records for temperatures</a>.</p><p>Eric Boldt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, said it</p> '<p>s not a coincidence that the </p>e<p>Earth's warmest year on record, 2016, was an El Nio year. </p><p>"There's a lot of talk that this coming year could be one of the warmest on record," Boldt said. </p><p>The <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-temperatures-set-reach-new-records-next-five-years" target="_blank">World Meteorological Organization recently predicted</a> there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years  and the five-year period as a whole  will be the warmest on record.</p><p>In Southern California, just about any category of El Nio  weak, moderate</p>,<p> or strong  can bring above-normal precipitation in Southern California, Boldt said, meaning there is potential for two back-to-back wet years following this year's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-03/california-snowpack-is-the-deepest-its-ever-been">unexpectedly soggy winter</a>.</p><p>However, he added that it is not a guarantee.</p><p>"Any time we talk about El Nio, historically, rainfall totals in Southern California have been above normal in most cases  but not all," Boldt said. </p><p>He noted that the 2015-</p>20<p>16 El Nio was one of the strongest on record, but failed to deliver significant rain, flooding and other anticipated effects in Southern California, ultimately dropping only about 6 inches of rain.</p><p>But El Nio can also have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-19/return-of-el-nino-would-have-far-reaching-impacts">knock-on effects</a> in California and across the world, including economic and agricultural </p> effects. impacts.<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2983" target="_blank">study published last month</a> found that the 1982-83 El Nio contributed to an estimated $4.1 trillion in global income losses in the five years that followed, and the 1997-98 El Nio contributed to an estimated $5.7 trillion in losses.</p><p>Median losses from the incoming event could be at least $3 trillion by 2029, the study found.</p><p>Warmer winter temperatures can also affect crops in California and other agricultural regions, particularly crops that require a higher chill during winter dormancy, such as pistachios, cherries and pears. </p><p>Earlier bud-breaks and flowering, longer growing seasons and more pressure from agricultural pests are also possible, researcher</p> s<p> said. </p><p>UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain noted that El Nio may already be exerting some influence on global circulation patterns, but it is also arriving amid some anomalous conditions such as an enhanced subtropical jet stream and <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/" target="_blank">record-breaking oceanic warmth</a>.</p><p>"So in some ways this year is a year with no reasonable historical analogues," Swain wrote in his blog, <a href="https://weatherwest.com/" target="_blank">Weather West</a>. </p><p>"Were hurtling toward a potentially strong El Nio event following a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-13/la-nina-california-rare-third-year">rare triple-dip La Nia</a> event amid a period of record oceanic warmth driven by climate change," Swain said. "It's a combination we havent really seen before in the modern era, and its a bit difficult to say what it might mean in the months to come."</p><p>He added that it is "fair to say there is even more uncertainty than usual regarding how the next 6 months or so will unfold" from a regional and even global climate perspective.</p><p>The outlook arrives as Southern California continues to experience a stretch of cool and cloudy weather in contrast to nearly everywhere else in the world, where recent months have leaned unusually warm. </p><p>The latest <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/lead14/" target="_blank">monthly outlook from the NOAA</a> indicates that below-normal temperatures will persist in Southern California and much of the Southwest through the end of the month. </p><p>But while Los Angeles <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-07/how-long-is-june-gloom-supposed-to-last-southern-california-can-expect-cooler-temperatures-cloudy-skies">remains shrouded in June gloom</a>, wildfires in </p>Western <p>Canada have blanketed that region  and much of the</p> east cost East Coast<p>  in thick smoke, producing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-08/unhealthy-air-smoke-continues-to-cover-large-swaths-of-u-s-for-third-straight-day">some of the worst air quality on Earth</a>.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Metro had no clear policy on whether its workers can administer the drug, he said. But he couldn't bear to watch people die needlessly.</p><p>In 15 months, he has revived 21 people. The Times verified most of the claims through time-stamped photographs and witnesses. </p><p>"I'm tired of seeing people dying right in front of me," said the worker, who has been with Metro for more than a decade and asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak with media.</p><p>Five months into the year, at least 35 people have died so far in the Metro system.<b> </b>The causes of deaths are </p>still <p>under investigation, </p>but<p>and most are suspected overdoses.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b6/5c/32dab7504a47b184e535f91f3fe5/1306769-me-metro-ambassador-narcan-02-mjc.jpg"></figure><p>Metro policy prohibits workers from freely speaking with media or photographing conditions inside the trains. But half a dozen current and former workers, </p> who include cleaning staff and security guardsfrom clean staff to those security guards<p>, spoke to </p> T<p>he Times about the deaths and near deaths caused by drug use on the trains.</p><p>Some are angry about conditions</p> ;<p> others feel resigned and numb. Their emotions are complicated </p>not just <p>by </p> not only<p> the brazen drug use, but </p> alsoby<p> a rise in attacks on Metro personnel. Last year, 158 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-25/police-arrest-teenager-suspected-of-stabbing-l-a-metro-bus-driver">operators were assaulted.</a> </p><p>"Unfortunately, when people with drug abuse issues come into our system from the communities we serve across L.A. County, our frontline employees bear the burden of discovering people whove overdosed, cleaning up after drug users or encountering their behavior while the drugs are in effect," </p>said  Metro spokesperson<p> Pamela Krebs</p>, a Metro spokesperson said<p> in an email. "The societal issues of drug abuse, crime, and homelessness across our county have made it much harder for them to do their jobs  and for Metro to provide the service it is intended to provide: safe, clean, efficient and reliable transportation."</p>One <p>A worker who was </p>brutally <p>attacked a few years ago during her night shift</p>,<p> said she was told not to record scenes she sees daily on her phone. H</p>, but h<p>er photo feed is filled with pictures of men taking drugs, people half clothed, dead bodies, fights and blood-stained walls. </p><p>"I pray. I pray a lot because, Lord, only Jesus can change it," she said.</p><p>Complaints about drug use and sales reported on the Metro Transit Watch app <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-24/overdose-deaths-on-metro-trains">soared nearly 100% last year,</a> compared with the previous year. But the employee with Narcan in his pocket didn't need data to prove how bad things had gotten. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/96/12bdfa384654a22b1ba45c97bc78/1306769-me-metro-ambassador-narcan-01-mjc.jpg"></figure><p>That night in February last year, he arrived to see a </p>young man whose <p>limp body </p>was <p>sprawled out inside a rail car, </p>hair tussled wearing skin tight white pants, <p>according to his photos of the event. Metro transit officers were standing over </p> a young man with tussled hair and skin-tight white pantshim<p>. </p><p>"This guy was turning purple. Not breathing, vomiting on himself," the worker said. "From what I can tell, he was very, very close to death." </p><p>The worker pulled the packet from his Metro vest and offered up the </p>medicine, commonly referred to as <p>Narcan</p>,<p> to the officers. None </p>of them <p>wanted to administer a drug they had yet been trained to use,<b> </b>he said. </p><p>In the past, the worker would have felt the same. He had had little sympathy for the riders </p>that <p>he saw daily, strung out in bench seats. </p>I was <p>"</p>like, oh, well, t<p>They did this to themselves," he recalled thinking</p>said<p>. "</p>I really didn't, t<p>To be honest, I didn't really give a s." </p><p>But the year before, he had befriended a 21-year-old </p>man <p>struggling with fentanyl addiction. The young man was earnest, asking </p>him <p>about how credit works and buying a home. He had a baby on the way, had gone through rehab and was seemingly starting a new chapter. </p><p>On Christmas Eve,<b> </b>just two months before, the friend died of an overdose. </p><p>"His baby was due like April," he said. "It was heart-wrenching."</p><p>The friendship gave him a new understanding. </p><p>"I had a different perspective on the overdoses that I would see" he said. "It was personal."</p><p>He clutched the tiny spray bottle and pumped a dose up the man's nose. Paramedics arrived. The man came to</p>, stood up<p> and walked off without acknowledgment. </p>But t<p>The worker was astonished at his recovery. That night, he searched online for training videos online.</p><p>"It was the push that I needed to look into it," he said. "To do something about it." </p><p>At that point, </p>nobody inside<p> Metro employees had not been trained on how to use Narcan, although law enforcement officers who</p><b> </b>that<p> patrol the system carry the drug. Recently,<b> </b>transit safety officers and ambassadors have been trained.</p><p>CEO Stephanie Wiggins<b> </b>has said she hopes that training of its officers and 327 ambassadors  who are contracted to greet and help passengers  will have a "huge impact" on the system.</p><p>Fabian Bolanos, 52, says he has administered the drug four times since he started as an ambassador in fall. </p><p>"It's pretty intense," he said. </p><p>The first time, he spotted a man passed out on a bench at the Civic Center/Grand Park station with a needle in his arm, lips turning purple. </p><p><b>"</b>I just immediately grabbed Narcan that I had, and I administered it," he said. "He wasn't coming back, and I started compressions. Then I gave him the second dose of Narcan, kept going on compressions, and finally he came back."<b> </b></p><p>At the time, he had been on the job about two months, working for a Metro contractor, Strive Well-Being, Inc. </p>He said t<p>The company "expressly prohibited" using the medicine, he said, but </p>he decided <p>he wouldn't just watch people die</p>, no matter what the policy was<p>.</p><p>Metro eventually changed the policy.<b> </b></p><p>Bolanos, a former methamphetamine </p>drug <p>user and alcoholic who once overdosed, said the man fortified his own sobriety. </p><p>"It's a daily affirmation that I'm doing the right thing and that I need to maintain my sobriety," he said. "If I can hand it over and maybe give it to somebody else in need, maybe they go to a rehab, I'm doing my part."</p><p>When the revived man came to, Bolanos said</p> ,<p> he got up and left on his scooter. He </p>later <p>saw him later and asked</p> ,<p> "You remember me?" </p><p>The man did. He appeared embarrassed</p>, he said<p>. </p><p>"I told him try to get him to a rehab," Bolanos said. "I told him this is not going to end well. I have seen him around the train stations. He is still using." </p>Both <p>Bolanos and the unidentified Metro worker have had days where they have to administer Narcan twice. Bolanos, who is </p>also <p>leading a campaign to organize</p>among<p> Strive Well-Being workers</p> to organize a union<p>, said conditions have improved over recent months. </p>Last month<p>In May, Metro reported a 17.8% reduction in complaints about drug use between Feb. 13 and May 8 as it cracked down on drug use on the system. </p>But i<p>It is still rampant.</p><p>Less than three months ago, he was exiting the platform at Westlake/MacArthur Park station when he saw a man in his 20s slumped over, lips turning blue. He had no pulse. Bolanos revived the man with Narcan and headed up the station's mezzanine to the break room when he saw a man in his 50s passed out </p>on the floor in front of <p>near the ticket vending machine. </p><p>"This is unbelievable," he recalled thinking. "Another person right here right now."</p><p>"I was still trembling from giving compressions," he said. "I was still in this intense emotional feeling, and for me to look and see this other guy, I said, 'Nah, this can't be going back to back.'"</p><p>To stem the deaths, Los Angeles County helped distribute <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-30/desperate-to-stop-fentanyl-deaths-officials-are-distributing-drug-pipes">112,000 boxes of Narcan</a> last year as people left jail or through </p>community <p>groups such as</p> like<p> Community Health Project L.A.</p><p>The program is part of the county's expansion of what is known in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-19/overdose-california-grant-syringe-programs">treatment circles as harm-reduction services,</a> strategies aimed at reducing the deadly effects of drug use. Since beginning in 2019, the program has reported 19,661 </p> n<p>aloxone reversals, which is likely an undercount. Roughly half of those, or 9,790 reversals, were reported last year. </p><p>"It's everywhere in a way that it wasn't before," said Shoshanna Scholar, director of the county's Department of Health Services Harm Reduction Division. The agency helps train community workers, including staff at homeless shelters and other interim housing on how to use the medicine. "What we do know is without the </p> n<p>aloxone on that and that trajectory of the overdose deaths would be much, much worse."</p><p>Ricky Blumenthal, the associate dean for social justice at the Keck School of Medicine at USC, sees the drug use on Metro against a wider backdrop of inequity in a region where homelessness has been growing as rents rise and there's few discrete spaces to use drugs on the streets. Many of those using drugs on the system don't have permanent homes, he said, but not all. Drug use can be a cause of homelessness or a symptom. </p><p>Whatever it is, overdoses <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/chie/reports/Homeless_Mortality_Report_2022.pdf" target="_blank">take more homeless people than violence or car accidents.</a> </p><p>In early 1990s, Blumenthal co-founded the Oakland California Syringe Exchange Program and was a founding board member of the national Harm Reduction Coalition, an advocacy and training organization devoted to improving the health of people who use drugs. </p><p>He started the program because he felt state, federal and local authorities weren't doing enough to stop the spread of HIV among drug users. People were left to die, much as they are now. </p><p>"Ultimately, we have to start caring for people who have become disadvantaged in our society," he said. "We're creating homelessness as a structural reality," he said. "We can make different choices. "</p><p>There's no one fix, he said, but providing better housing or providing overdose prevention sites, where people can safely use drugs. </p><p>Recently the Federal Drug Administration approved the use of Narcan for over-the-counter sales, a move that could allow for wider distribution of the drug and remove training barriers. </p><p>An overdose can happen in a few minutes of ingesting drugs, sometimes longer, depending the dose and whether it was smoked or injected, said Brian Hurley, the medical director for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's Substance Abuse Prevention and Control. </p>But o<p>Once breathing stops, death arrives </p>with<p>in minutes. </p><p>It's not unusual for the nearly 2,600 maintenance workers at Metro to find people who are using drugs, passed out or unresponsive. </p><p>"It's taken a great mental toll on our membership," said Art Aguilar, former president of the Amalgamated Transit </p> UnionUnit<p> Local 1277, which represents those workers. </p><p>Maintenance staff</p>workers<p> regularly clean up needles, pipes and foil used to carry and cook drugs. </p><p>"We have seen an increase in usage of our therapy in our medical plan for our members," he said. </p><p>"I was hired in 33 years ago as a service attendant at RTD and you had issues with drugs then, but not to the level it is today," he said. "When I was hired in, I was brought to clean buses, not to find a body in it." </p><p>In one of the transit worker's videos, he is calling out to a thin man who is bent over, limbs tangled under a rail seat. He slowly pulls the unresponsive man out to the car floor. Three cigarettes and a </p>small <p>piece of foil </p>lay next to <p>lie beside the seat where he passed out. The worker sprays the </p>nasal <p>medicine in the man's nose and slaps his chest until he heaves a breath. Minutes later the man vomits and comes to. Dazed, he walks away.</p><p>"Do I think I'm saving their lives? Yes, absolutely," the worker said. "Do I think that's gonna help them in the long run? Probably not."</p><p>"I go home and I pray. I hope that this is like some sort of wake-up call for them or something," he said. "But I don't have my head in the sand thinking that it's going to be."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

61st&nbsp;race, was pulled up in the upper stretch,  and  was vanned off the course and euthanized. &nbsp; Churchill Downs confirmed the death in a statement after racing and stressed a commitment to safety but listed no concrete examples of changes  they hope it hopes to make or causes for the spike in fatalities. It is with absolute dismay and sorrow that we report this highly unusual statistic, the statement read in part. Our team members mourn the loss of these animals as we continue to work together to discover cause and determine appropriate investments to minimize, to the degree possible, any avoidable risk in this sport and on our property. ... We have been rigorously working since the opening of the meet to understand what has led to this spike and have yet to find a conclusive  discernable [discernible] pattern as we await the findings of ongoing investigations into these injuries and fatalities. Kimberley Dream was running in a $40,000 claiming race with only five starters. In her last five races, she lost by 19, 32, 14, 31 and 33 lengths. There is no state pre-review panel in Kentucky, like there is in California, to determine  if whether a horse should be running based on recent  past performances and other factors. Generally speaking [and not specifically about this mare], if a similar horse entered to race in California, those losing distances in the previous races would certainly be a significant concern, raise a red flag and be scrutinized by the entry exam panel that reviews each race card in California, <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-09-21/jeff-blea-returns-to-job-as-chrb-equine-medical-director">     Dr. Jeff Blea  </a></p> , equine medical director of the California Horse Racing Board, told The Times. Many factors are considered and reviewed by the entry panel for each horse entered, including poor performance and running lines in those races. With a horses [past performances] showing those poor efforts, if the horse were allowed to run, it would be subject to extra veterinary scrutiny and monitoring from entry day until race time.&nbsp;The horse death toll at Churchill Downs continued to grow on Friday when <p>On Friday, Lost in Limbo, a 7-year-old gelding, was euthanized after breaking down in the seventh race. The horse was running in a claiming race, his 35th lifetime start. </p>Adding that to a previously unreported death two weeks ago, 11 horses have died at in a month at the Louisville home of <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-06/kentucky-derby-coverage">the Kentucky Derby</a></p>.<p><a href="https://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=10068349&amp;registry=T&amp;rbt=TB" target="_blank">Lost in Limbo</a> threw his rider, Ricardo Santana Jr., during the post parade </p>buy <p>but was </p>OKs <p>OK'd to run. </p>The death was confirmed by Dr. Will Farmer, equine medical director for Churchill Downs, Inc., through a spokesman.On May 13, <p><a href="https://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&amp;refno=10603924&amp;registry=T&amp;rbt=TB" target="_blank">Bosque Redondo</a></p> finished 10th in a race but was then taken off the course by equine ambulance, according to the stewards report. The horse was transported to a Lexington clinic for further diagnostics, the report said. It was later reported that the horse was humanely euthanized due to his injuries and poor prognosis for recovery.<p>The number of equine fatalities </p>rivals <p>surpasses that of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-12-19/horse-racing-investigation">Santa Anita in 2019</a>.

The road had been closed for weeks </p> due to <p>roadway damage</p>s<p> left by the multiple storms of last winter. </p><p>Two other crucial park roads (both of which close every winter) have yet to open.</p><p>The snows have forced many changes and delays as the park</p>s<p> gears up for summer. The cables that climbers use to summit Half Dome, for instance, usually are put in place in May, but that hasn't happened yet. (While Highway 120 has been closed, Bay Area visitors have been reaching the park via Highway 140, a detour of roughly 30 miles.)</p><p>Though the reopening of Big Oak Flat Road doesnt change northbound driving directions for most visitors from Southern California  who enter the park by way of Oakhurst and Highway 41  it is likely to ease traffic circulation in the park. And it means visitors can follow loop itineraries, entering from the south entrance and returning by way of the west entrance.</p><p>Today, </p>June 9,<p> the park is </p>also <p>starting summer shuttle service on Mariposa Grove Road. That service takes visitors from Mariposa Grove Welcome Plaza  near the park's south entrance  to Mariposa Grove, home to more than 500 giant sequoia trees. (The road from the plaza to the trees is open only to shuttle buses and private vehicles with disability placards.)</p><p>Meanwhile, road crews are working toward summer openings for Glacier Point Road and Tioga Road, but because of lingering snow and construction</p>s<p>, dates remain uncertain.</p><p>Glacier Point Road is expected to open "no earlier than July, probably later," Yosemite's website reports. This is the seasonal route that gives visitors access to </p> the <p>classic view of Half Dome from Glacier Point, about 7,200 feet above sea level and 3,200 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley. Glacier Point Road was closed all last summer for construction. Even after reopening, rangers say, 30-minute delays are likely at first.</p><p>The opening date also remains unknown for the parks most popular seasonal route, Tioga Road, which connects Yosemite to the Owens Valley near Lee Vining and Mono Lake. Tioga Road, snowbound in winter, often opens in May or June after mild winters, June or July after snowy ones. But this years heavy Sierra snowpack  244% of normal on April 1  has rangers reluctant to make any prediction for this summer.</p><p>Another factor for summer travelers to weigh</p>t<p>: Yosemite Valley may be unusually crowded this summer, especially on weekends. This is the first time in four years that the park hasnt required advance booking for summertime day-tripper visits to the valley. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday was by far the nations worst day in recent history for wildfire smoke pollution, with more people exposed to higher levels of soot than any day since 2006, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallBBurke/status/1666843238270128129">rapid analysis by Stanford University scientists</a>.</p><p>Thats hardly a surprise to people from New York to Minnesota who have been suffering under this acrid, life-threatening pall. And its the type of in-your-face environmental health crisis that Californians know too well, with authorities urging people to stay inside and filter the air they breathe and canceling outdoor activities, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill">large numbers of people</a> almost certainly getting sick or dying. The second-worst smoke day, after all, was in September 2020, when the haze from an explosion of climate-fueled wildfires up and down the West Coast blotted out the sun, shrouding San Francisco in an apocalyptic orange and contributing to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/23/smoke-from-california-fires-may-have-killed-more-than-1000-people/?clearUserState=true">potentially thousands of early deaths</a>.</p><p>The otherworldly veil that has hung over some of the nations most densely populated areas is the latest illustration of the fact that an overheating planet knows no human-made boundaries, and that as much as we try, no one will be spared the impacts. Everyone, after all, has to breathe.</p><p>These wildfire smoke episodes are disasters as serious as hurricanes, floods or heat waves, and come with a steep human toll. Whether in the East or in the West, they are just one tragic example of how climate change is coming for us all in both a slow accretion and sudden, dramatic bursts.</p><p>We often talk about global warming in terms of incremental change, like fractions of degrees over decades. But it also moves quickly, through the amplification of extreme events such as California's recent spate of record-breaking wildfires, the deadly 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome that pushed temperatures in Portland, Ore., to an unthinkable 116 degrees </p>Fahrenheit <p>and the torrential rain of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 that <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/digest/hurricane-harvey-climate-change-double-flooding-homes">flooded tens of thousands of homes</a> </p> in Texas and Louisiana. <p>Now we add to this horrible list the Manhattan skyline enveloped in a</p> <p> sickly sepia smog that looks </p>like  as if<p> it floated out of the dystopian world of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4">Blade Runner 2049</a>."</p><p>These smoke-filled vistas should be front of mind when we talk about the climate crisis, because they send a clear signal that it's a health crisis too.</p><p>And unfortunately, many Americans can expect more smoky days like these in their future. Much like heat waves, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/smoke-waves-will-affect-millions/">smoke waves,</a> a term researchers coined several years ago to describe consecutive days of unhealthy air quality from wildfires, are expected to grow more frequent, long-lasting and intense over the next few decades. Growing numbers of people will have to contend with unhealthy levels of smoke, a particularly nasty type of pollution that lodges deep in the lungs and can enter the bloodstream to worsen asthma, lung and heart disease and cut lives short.</p><p>The increase in smoke pollution, driven by bigger, more intense fires fueled by human-caused global warming, has already been <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30882">eroding hard-won improvements</a> in the nations air quality from decades of emissions-cutting regulations. And even people living hundreds of miles from a wildfire can pay a grave health toll. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/20/wildfire-smoke-deaths-eastern-us/">One 2021 study found</a> that about three-quarters of the wildfire smoke-related asthma emergency room visits and deaths in recent years occurred east of the Rocky Mountains, due to the regions higher population density.</p><p>We have a chance to reduce this suffering, and prevent an even worse lung-choking reality for future generations. But only if we use this as an inflection point to get serious about slashing climate pollution and putting an end to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Lets not wait until the smoke clears to start. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Local boards and councils vote on ceremonial items like this all the time to recognize various communities in their districts.</p><p>But then the agents of hate <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">showed up</a>. Even before the meeting, dozens of people gathered outside to lodge their objection to a vote that they believe supported the rights of LGBTQ+ people. Among the protesters were members of the Proud Boys, a group advocating for white supremacist and anti-government ideologies </p>and  that <p>participated in the Jan. 6</p> , 2021,<p> insurrection. Soon, LGBTQ+ advocates showed up to protest the protesters, and before long the crowd became unruly and violent. Three people were arrested.</p><p>In the end, the Glendale school board voted to support the designation and, in so doing, took a courageous stand against an insidious strain of intolerance that has been creeping into public school districts across the nation.</p><p>Just the week before, a very similar scenario played out in North Hollywood over a school assembly featuring, The Great Big Book of Families at the Saticoy Elementary School. Protesters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/00000188-7edd-d4b7-a99a-7ffd36e50000-123">carried signs</a> with statements such as, Parental Choice Matters. Ironically, Saticoy parents did have a choice about whether they wanted their kids to attend the assembly. </p><p>That protest didn't scare the Los Angeles Unified school board either. On Tuesday the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-08/l-a-school-officials-double-down-on-lgbtq-support-in-wake-of-protests">board passed</a> a resolution listing upcoming events it will recognize in addition to Pride Month, such as LGBTQ+ History Month in October and Transgender Day of Remembrance on Nov. 20. In addition, the resolution encourages all district schools to incorporate LGBTQ+ curriculum adopted by the state.</p><p>Troublingly, the protests in Glendale and North Hollywood are part of a <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/for-the-first-time-ever-human-rights-campaign-officially-declares-state-of-emergency-for-lgbtq-americans-issues-national-warning-and-guidebook-to-ensure-safety-for-lgbtq-residents-and-travelers" target="_blank">growing political movement </a>nationwide targeting LGBTQ+ communities, trying to silence and erase them, and even often falsely accusing them of crimes. Books that have been banned in districts nationwide, including in California, are often targeted solely because <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2023/03/record-book-bans-2022" target="_blank">they include LGBTQ+ characters or topics</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/for-the-first-time-ever-human-rights-campaign-officially-declares-state-of-emergency-for-lgbtq-americans-issues-national-warning-and-guidebook-to-ensure-safety-for-lgbtq-residents-and-travelers" target="_blank">declared a state of emergency </a>for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. in light of more than 525 state bills in 2023 targeting them. It was the first time in its 43-year history that the civil rights organization made such a declaration. More than 70 of these bills have been signed into law so far this year. </p><p>These targeted campaigns arent just happening in states governed by primarily Republican legislators. At the Temecula Valley Unified School District in Riverside County, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-03/temecula-valley-school-board-rejects-social-studies-curriculum-that-would-have-included-harvey-milk">teachers protested</a> on Tuesday after the school board rejected social studies textbooks and curriculum for elementary students that contained what school board members called morally objectionable material. School board </p> P<p>resident Joseph Komrosky called slain gay rights activist and former San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk a pedophile. Shame on that board for tolerating such hateful statements at a public meeting. </p><p>Too many school districts are giving into the intolerant bullies. Los Angeles and Glendale should be proud that their school boards did not. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

We first met in her Wallingford, Conn., kitchen the day after Christmas in 1987. This was a few years after her son Al, my partner (now husband) of 36 years, first disclosed to her that she had a gay son. She was accepting but drew the line at never wanting to meet a man Al was with. A daughter of Irish-Catholic immigrant parents, she found it too much in the mid-80s to convey approval by welcoming someone like me into her home.</p><p>And yet, six months after Al and I met that summer in San Diego, here I was at her Wallingford kitchen table, sharing a meal of Als favorite scallops. She was aloof, yet not rejecting or mean. Over the next few years, I would discover that meanness was not in her character. She was conflicted, but she was not the kind of person to deflect her moral conflict via hostility toward me or her son. She loved Al too much for such things.</p><p>I never imagined I would have a mother-in-law. Such a thing was inconceivable for a gay male couple in those days. We were busy just trying not to be rejected.</p><p>Yet over time, she and I developed a mutual respect that eventually became a relationship with a son-in-law whom she never expected she could love.</p><p>Six months after our 1987 Christmas meeting, Al was diagnosed with a medical condition that required brain surgery. He came through the surgery beautifully. When Mr. and Mrs. Killen (this was what they asked me to call them) walked into the post-op hospital room after their emergency flight from Connecticut, Al said, without hesitation and in a strong post-anesthesia voice, Dougs in charge.</p><p>Als parents could have protested. They had the legal rights, not me. But they didnt. They loved Al too much for such things.</p><p>On our next trip to Wallingford, they had moved into the family home passed down across generations. Als sister told us they had prepared for our stay by moving the guest rooms double bed into the basement and setting up twin beds instead. Al said simply that this is not how we sleep. We would be fine with going to a hotel or returning the double bed to its previous location. The bed moved; we stayed. The room never changed again.</p><p>I noticed during later visits that Mrs. Killen made sure to stock her refrigerator with my favorite New England soda, birch beer (feel free to look it up). She knew how much I loved her baked macaroni and cheese and made it a tradition to serve it for us in Connecticut. I also became her VCR technician. She relied on me to program her video recorder to tape her beloved UConn womens basketball games. One time she called our home  it was still the landline era  and Al answered. He heard the caller ask, Is Doug home? Al said, Is this you, Mom? To which she replied, Yes, but I need Doug to help me with the VCR.</p><p>She spoke with her actions. Rather than flexing her parental authority by rejecting her sons relationship, she prioritized her love for him. Simple gestures, such as offering food, conveyed her deep well of affection that now included me.</p><p>Before Als father died, the four of us took vacations together. On these trips, Mr. and Mrs. Killen could be free from their grandparent duties and fully enjoy our doting on them. Gathering as two couples, we created our own special memories in San Francisco, Puerto Vallarta, the Grand Canyon, Los Angeles and Als and my home during many dinners with our chosen San Diego family.</p><p>My mother-in-law died on the third day of Pride month this year. I thought it would be a fitting tribute to honor Mrs. Killen and her journey from just accepting me to eventually loving and including me as part of her family. I am proud of her, and proud of Al and myself. Over the past 36 years we each leaned into the love between mother, son and son-in-law.</p><p>Happy Pride to every mother-in-law who has chosen to enrich their life by expanding themselves and spreading their love to someone like me who never expected, and had to learn how, to embrace it.</p>Douglas Braun-Harvey is cofounder of the Harvey Institute, a sexual health author and trainer and a sex therapy supervisor.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Times, it had all finally come to a head: a final showdown in court over whether Paulina or Bobby would get to keep the girls. It was culture versus culture. Which, if you ask Bobbys lawyer, was sort of bulls.</p><p><b>Richard Sullivan: </b></p>Again, I think she's using it as a shield, saying that she's, Woe is me because I'm Romani and I escaped the boogeyman and they're still after me, perhaps. I don't see that to be the case.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>As long as Ive known Paulina and the longer Ive reported on her story, the clearer it's become that everything she did led up to this. To the decision of whether or not she could retain custody of her kids. And to Paulina, this decision wasnt just about who would put the girls to bed at night or get them ready for school in the morning. It was about what kind of world theyd grow up in.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens:</b></p> I don't want them to have an arranged marriage, and I don't want them to be taken out of school or to go to school and not be taken seriously.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And in the summer of 2021, the court handed down its decision.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>So the judge agreed that the girls will be with me.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>It was decided Paulina would keep the girls a majority of the time, about 75%, and that included every school day. Paulina was more than content with that ruling.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I want them to still spend time with their dad and their family. I didn't mind them being fully immersed in the culture as long as the other things like education was prioritized.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And so her daughters could have what Paulina had wanted for herself: a life full of possibilities, of choice. They could grow up to be a ballerina or a mathematician. Or a veterinarian, like Paulina had wanted to be when she was little. In fact, Paulina was going to school at the same time as her daughters. They were all getting their education, all working toward a future where they could be anything they wanted to be. </p><p>So Paulina won. This was the moment shed been waiting for. </p><p>So, of course, I kept following up with her. Just because  what happens now? What happens when you get everything you want? But not too long after Paulina had gotten everything, things took a turn.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I had some mixed feelings going back to school, I guess. I felt like this is definitely what I wanted to do, was go back to school. But I also felt like I'm too old or have too much going on. Like I won't be able to succeed.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Paulina had stopped taking classes. She was no longer in school, which, honestly, kind of surprised me. She had gone through all of this work, all this struggle, but once she had gotten what shed been fighting for, she gave this part of it up. Even if she explained it away as just a break or a pause, I got the feeling she might not go back.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I did take a break. I'm on a break right now because my life has gotten extremely busy in my business.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And as I would find out, the business Paulina got into seemed to undermine absolutely everything Paulina had fought for  in a lot of ways, to a lot of people. And not just Bobbys lawyer.</p><p><b>Richard Sullivan: </b></p>And that's kind of disingenuous because she's still living that culture.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>In some ways, to some people, Paulina got her victory and then reversed course. </p>So what was this all even for?<p>This is Foretold.</p><p>In the months after she left her community, as she was finding her footing, Paulina needed money.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Because I have to live and survive, and I have a lot of attorney bills to pay off.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>So she tried various ways to scrape together cash. She spent some time working at her husband Matts recruiting company. Sometimes she did wellness work for them, doing life coaching and saging the office. Other times she did operations there: desk job stuff, a typical 9-to-5 with co-workers who probably said stuff like case of the Mondays.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I was doing my regular computer office day job, and I was just thinking, This is so boring.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>So she tried finding new work, something more aligned with the biotech or neuroscience job she had started taking classes for. But finding a job like that was hard.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Every time I'm in an interview, I have to explain to people why I don't have an education and why I don't even have a high school diploma.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And explaining herself meant explaining her whole life.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I try to make a small thing like, Oh, well, I don't usually say this, but I was in an arranged marriage. When I was younger, I was taken out of elementary school. I am currently going to school now. But this is why I don't have an education.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Paulina said shed been in countless job interviews that went this way.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I notice some of the interviewers are probably like, OK, that sounds like a little, like, you know, but it's a great excuse not to have an education. And so it's a hard thing.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>It seemed so fruitless that Paulina eventually stopped trying. She stopped going to school. She stopped looking for jobs. And she found herself missing the one job she knew for a fact she was really good at.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Yeah, I felt like when I took space away from it, everything in my body was calling me back to just this practice, I guess.<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>The practice of fortunetelling.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And I still love it. Meeting people and talking to them and intimately having these conversations.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Instead of resenting her Romani roots, Paulina began to embrace them.  Paulina was sliding back into her fate.<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And I actually am more closer to my practice now than I feel like I ever was in my whole life.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Paulina was sliding back into her fate. <p>Except this time, she felt she was choosing it, deciding to do the thing she had been raised to do since she was a kid.</p><p>And I have to admit, that at first this sort of made intuitive sense to me. I was like, Huh, OK, I mean, thats sort of ironic, but whatever.</p><p>But it didnt take me long to realize that the implications of this are huge. Because this was just a few weeks after getting her kids. Right after that trial that made it so dramatically obvious that she was looking for a new life, she opened up another fortunetelling shop.</p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>I am on my way to visit Paulina at her shop.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>I parked my car near her store. Its tucked into the back of a little cluster of boutiques and businesses on a busy street.</p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Oh my God. This looks amazing.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>This tiny shop is one room  no more than 400 square feet, maybe. Paulina had just gotten the keys a couple days before. She had big plans for the space.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>It's going to be super dark but inviting. There's going to be prints and patterns everywhere and just old cultural elements to it, I guess.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Paulina was still going to be doing traditional readings with palms and tarot cards. And she was also going to be doing meditation and chakra bowls; selling crystals, soaps, candles, even teabags.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>We're going to have those Turkish teacups that people can buy, as well as hookahs. I want to sell some of those.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Like a wellness shop with hookahs. So it was a bit of a cultural hodgepodge. But it was clear to me that this was Paulina doing her own thing, combining her tradition with other tools and influences, kind of like what she used to do in her last shop. But this time its different. Because now she had spent time in Matts business.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And it's interesting how I'm learning about the sales world and marketing in a totally weird corporate way. And I'm thinking, Whoa, we've been, I've been doing this for like 20 years, you know what I mean? And now I feel like I am a salesperson.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>After spending some time in the outside world, she realized that persuasion and sales werent anything to be ashamed about.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Now that I'm more educated, I guess, I don't resent my practices and I don't feel like I was a, you know  hmm. Do I? I don't feel like I was a born and bred scam artist.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>So this time, in this shop, Paulina said she wanted to be completely honest about who she is. She wouldnt hide her identity from her clients. Or from anyone.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Yeah. I'm not hiding my culture anymore because these are our practices. These are our cultural practices.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And thats why she called her new business </p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Romani Holistic Healing. Yes.<p><b>Faith Pinho:</b></p> How did you come to that name?&nbsp;<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Nothing else sounded right. And I also want people to know that this is a real culture and these are practices and these are from us. We carried these traditions, especially the fortunetelling traditions.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>We. Listening back, I can hear Paulina really leaning into the we in that sentence. For someone who had distanced herself from her community, she sure seemed to be selling herself as a part of it. But the people shed grown up with were not buying it.</p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>OK, Paulina, are you there?&nbsp;<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Yep.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>A few days after I met Paulina in her new fortunetelling shop, she told me she was getting threatening calls. That a family member had begged her to leave her shop.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And he said that he wanted to warn me. And he said also that he's afraid, he's afraid something will happen to me. I don't know for sure what their intentions are, but I know that my whole family is freaking the f out over it.I'm not concerned that they'll hurt my babies, but they may do something to me. I'm afraid, but I can't always live in fear. The reality is I'm going to be where I want to be.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Even if that place was the very same town that shed worked in before she left.</p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b>I got word from someone that said, She's not allowed to ever step foot in these towns again.<b>Faith Pinho: </b><p>If you remember, Romani fortunetellers have to buy a territory in order to practice in certain neighborhoods because it ensures that Romani families dont compete with one another for the same client pool. Among Romani psychics, it's understood that you respect the space by staying on your own turf. But Paulina was not doing that.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>I like that clientele, and I want to be there.&nbsp; The ex-family, I'm sure if you ask them, they would say, "She's not supposed to be here." I got word from someone that said, She's not allowed to ever step foot in these towns again. <b>Faith Pinho: </b>It turns out that nothing came of those threats. And Paulina remained unfazed. <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> I like that clientele, and I want to be there.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And it wasnt because this location was convenient. It was nearly 50 miles from her new home in San Diego County. She had to drive an hour every day to get there. This was an active decision. By being in this territory, Paulina was putting herself in direct competition with Bobbys family, who had taken over her old shop.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>So I'm opening shop back up there, And they can't mess with me, too, because I'm out of the culture, you know?&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>It turns out that nothing came of those threats. And Paulina remained unfazed.  It was like she was playing the old game but not using the same rules anymore.<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Reclaiming my  I don't believe in the territorial laws. I feel like I'm reclaiming my right as an American citizen to have a business wherever I want. You know what I'm saying? That's what I'm doing.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>What she was doing was setting up a business called Romani Holistic Healing and claiming her rights as an American citizen. These two things are at odds, according to many people  and not just her old community. Paulina was also alienating someone close to her. Someone who had stood by her side as she left and had put her own reputation on the line to help Paulina.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>This is not what I wanted when I said I wanted to help people. This is bulls, is what this is.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Note: "Thats after the break" is intentionally excluded from this transcript. -LR <p>Paulina had been leaning on Gina, relying on her for support, for a few years at this point. Gina had always offered Paulina advice and a shoulder to cry on. But in the spring of 2022, Gina was pissed.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>Yes, pissed.<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina and I had been texting, and I suggested we hop on a call because she wanted to vent about Paulina, who, again, she calls Nina.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>I don't know what she believes in, and that's what bothers me the most.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Yeah.&nbsp;<p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>But now I know that Nina doesn't really know what she wants. It's not her fault. It's just part of growing up. I get it. But she won't  she's not listening to anyone. She's not listening to me.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>This is what had really set Gina off: A few days before, Paulina was having a hard time and had called Gina for support.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>She was in a really bad way one day, and I said, Just get in your car and come here.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina offered for Paulina to come stay with her up in San Jose. Gina said she could help Paulina set up her life there  hook her up with an apartment. She volunteered to babysit the girls while Paulina was at work. Gina even reached out to a friend to get Paulina a job. Gina said they had talked about it seriously, thinking through logistics and details.</p><p>And then, a few hours later, Paulina called to say she was backing out. She wasnt going to come anymore. Which would be fine if this had just happened once.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>It wasn't the first time. It was probably the third or fourth in the last year.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina was fed up.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>One minute she's calling me telling me shes having an emergency. Five seconds later, she's posting, I got this new puppy. I'm like, OK, so five days ago, you needed to come and have an emergency visit to my house. At this point, I'm not offering her to come over here again.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>And it wasnt just that Gina was fed up. Associating with Paulina had caused Gina a lot of trouble. There were tangible repercussions. Because all the work Gina had put into slowly and carefully mending her relationship with her family went straight out the window. </p>Like<p> Gina couldnt go to her nephews engagement party, which was happening that night.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>I asked my sister, Is it because I'm married outside the culture? She said, Nope, they don't care. It was because you helped Nina. And I'm pissed off because I don't get to go to an engagement party because I helped her do nothing, basically.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Oh, wow.<p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>Yeah, exactly. I helped her do nothing. <b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina had assumed they were on the same page. And she was realizing that she had assumed incorrectly. <b>Gina Merino: </b> But it's really the way she's making money that bothers me the most.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>To Gina, Paulina just seemed to be reverting back to her old life by opening a psychic shop. For her, there is no mainstream-American-style life that also involves fortunetelling. </p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>See, and that's what makes me go, Well, then maybe she doesn't want to leave the culture. It would have been easier for me right now, today, if I knew I helped her and there was a reason for me helping her. I don't feel like there was a reason.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina wondered if Paulina just wanted the superficial trappings of outsider life, the easy freedoms.</p><p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>My reason for leaving was not so I could date whoever I wanted. My reason for leaving was not so I could wear pants and go to the gym. My reason for leaving was stability.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>According to Gina, Paulina said she wanted stability. But whenever Gina offered her that stability, offered her an apartment and a job, she said Paulina wouldnt take it.</p><b>Gina Merino: </b>But it's really the way she's making money that bothers me the most.<b>Faith Pinho: </b>Gina had assumed they were on the same page. And she was realizing that she had assumed incorrectly.<p><b>Gina Merino: </b></p>She's young , you know. She's growing. I love her. I just don't think she's stable.  She doesn't want stability. You have two children, and you're not living with your people anymore. You're now on your own without your family backing you up. So I don't know what her priorities are. And I don't agree with them at this point.&nbsp;I can understand if you want to be Gypsy. I don't have a problem with that. But you're riding the fence so hard and you want every good piece from every part. Life doesn't work like that. What do you want? Do you want the American lifestyle or do you want the Gypsy lifestyle? Choose.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>But Paulina refused to choose. She still wont choose one life or the other. This has baffled almost everyone close to Paulina. No one could understand what she wanted.</p> <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> I feel like I'm kind of fulfilling a bigger purpose. I think I'm doing something a little bit more meaningful by just focusing on my culture and hopefully trying to change the narrative. <b>Faith Pinho: </b><p>And so Paulina soon found a community of people who understood exactly what she wanted. She found her way into the international community of Romani activists.</p><p><b>[Clip from Romanistan: Jessica Reidy: </b></p>Welcome to Romanistan podcast.<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Were your friendly neighborhood Gypsies.<p><b>]</b></p>&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>In early 2021, Paulina met a Romani educator, fortuneteller and activist online, Jessica Reidy, who also goes by Jezmina Von Thiele. Together they launched their own podcast, Romanistan, which Jess explained in their first episode.</p><p><b>[Clip from Romanistan: Jessica Reidy: </b></p>Romanistan was a country proposed by Romani activists in the 50s, where Roma were imagined to live in peace , away from the outside world.<p><b>]</b></p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Romanistan nods to the idea of a Romani nation. An imagined home for the Romani diaspora flung across the world. A utopia of sorts.</p><p><b>[Clip from Romanistan: Jessica Reidy: </b></p>And some topics were excited to cover in the future are fortunetelling, misrepresentation of Gypsies on TV and how were countering that, LGBTQIA community and activism inside and outside the Romani community.<p><b>]</b></p>&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Paulina and Jess podcast explores what it means to be Romani and what that imagined nation home could be like. A sort of love letter to the community that celebrates the parts of Romani culture they love, while talking candidly about the parts they want to see change.</p><p><b>[Clip from Romanistan: Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Also, celebrating Romani culture and achievements. How we can stop the practice of child marriage. Romani art, activism, science.<p><b>]</b></p><p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>With the launch of Romanistan, Paulina has become a sort of public figure in the last couple of years. She and Jess were invited to speak on a panel for Columbia Universitys Roma Peoples Project. Paulina said they also have provided cultural sensitivity editing and consulting. And, you know, Paulina has continued to talk to me on Foretold.</p> <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> I grappled with needing to tell my story by telling the audience, "I'm still learning and getting to know everything too. Sometimes I'm just as clueless as you are, even though it's my life." And I think really just telling the truth and being honest has been a difficult process. <b>Faith Pinho: </b>And so <p>this woman who says she left her community has become something of a representative for it.</p><p>But for some folks that Ive spoken to who watched her burn everything to the ground, seeing Paulina turn around and become a spokesperson must feel like a sick joke. I can only imagine what Bobby and his family might think.</p><p><b>Richard Sullivan:</b></p> I think that Paulina likes her culture.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Heres Richard Sullivan again. Bobbys lawyer.</p><p><b>Richard Sullivan: </b></p>Well, I understand that she's still reading palms. And so she's demonizing the culture, yet this is what she's doing for a living, still being part and parcel of that culture.<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>I can see what Richard is saying. But also  I mean, Paulina is no longer doing a lot of what she was expected to do. If shes not attending Romani funerals or weddings, not married to a Romani man, not upholding the traditions, then what does it mean to be Romani? Is culture something an individual can pick and choose for herself?</p><p>I think of some of the people I spoke to for this podcast: Professor Hancock, the linguist. Dr. Matache at Harvard. George Eli with his documentary and his TV appearances. I think about Gina and her continued love of hosting and hospitality. Or Brenda and how she still wears long, modest skirts even as shes questioning her own Romani tradition. And I think about many others Ive talked to, people who have different upbringings and jobs than Paulina. And yet theyre still very much Romani. They all share the history and value system and that connective tissue that gives meaning to their lives and their families and their children.</p><p>For Paulina, its teaching her daughters what she thinks it means to be Romani. And that includes fortunetelling. </p>Even taking them to read at fairs, like she used to do. <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> I'm not teaching them anything serious yet, but my 7-year-old  I don't think I practice with her as much as my mom practiced with me, but I still did practice with her. <b>Faith Pinho: </b>To Paulina, its clear that the girls possess the same gift their mom has. The same natural, intuitive clairvoyance that puts people at ease and the same powerful force of will. Its just in them. <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> My oldest one, she's like, "Mom, I went to school and one of my friends  I don't know why; she wasn't crying or anything  but at recess I gave her a hug and I said, "I think that you're really sad, and I love you." And her little friend was like, "My grandma just passed away." Maybe her friend was giving off these social cues that she's sad. But even then, I feel like this practice has still allowed her to be confident in her intuition enough so that she can then approach another person and make them feel better. <b>Faith Pinho: </b>The girls are learning to read the cards and trace each others palms, just like how Paulina learned from her mom when she was a kid. I remember when I was first learning about how Paulina was raised. Tarot cards and fortunetelling was part of her everyday life  as natural as eating cereal, she said. And here she was years later, raising her girls to do the exact same thing.<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>So I actually took the girls to a fair and together they made over $100. They made like $140 or $150. And my little one is such a hustler. It's insane. And it was the most cutest experience.&nbsp;But that's similar to how it was when I was younger. I would go and bring someone a flier, and then my mom was like, Whoever you bring in for a reading, then you can have a few dollars of that and go get yourself something. But I feel like my kids kind of embraced it on a different level.<b>Faith Pinho: </b>Paulina is teaching her daughters a more wellness brand of fortunetelling  the kind Paulina practices in her new shop, blending elements from inside and outside the culture.<b>Paulina Stevens: </b>There's other readers and up-and-coming readers that maybe are just kind of learning. And my kids also hang out with them all day long. And so now they have, even, other teachers that are not Romani, but they're just learning from all these different outlets, and it's interesting watching it.&nbsp;I'm not teaching them anything serious yet, but especially with my youngest one, she's like, You're going through a hard time right now. And I'm like, Where do you hear this stuff?<b>Faith Pinho: </b>To Paulina, its clear that the girls possess the same gift their mom has. The same natural, intuitive clairvoyance that puts people at ease and the same powerful force of will. Its just in them.<b>Paulina Stevens: </b> So if I even wanted to take them away from the culture, I don't think I could.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Now that she has the girls the majority of the time, Paulina believes she has the opportunity to show them what Romani culture can mean for them. Paulina and the girls could create their Romanistan. Their ideal world, made from the best of both worlds.</p><p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And when I say the best of both worlds, I feel like my expectations are low. I don't get to go to parties and I don't get to go to funerals and weddings. It's hard. I did have to leave the community. And I don't say that I left my culture, but I do say that I left my community.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>I didnt know you made that distinction. I feel like I've heard you say a lot of times, When I left the culture.&nbsp;<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>And I do say that because I feel like when I first left, I was like, It's the culture, you know? And now I'm a little more educated, and time has passed, and I realized you can take the girl out of the Gypsies but you can't take the Gypsy out of the girl.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b></p>Do you ever regret leaving?&nbsp;<p><b>Paulina Stevens: </b></p>Huh. Do I ever regret? I think it's not one of those questions that's yes or no. It's sometimes.&nbsp;<p><b>Faith Pinho: </b>Sometimes.</p> <b>Paulina Stevens: </b> I don't know. I think I do, sometimes, just because I miss everyone. I miss partying. I miss the atmosphere. I miss always having a community for support. And then I remember that thats not an option, and I'm happy, and I have so much opportunity now that I'm gone.  And I'm super thankful for my life because there's absolutely no way that my kids would have been able to excel in school. And I wouldn't have been able to support them the way that I want to support them and do the things I want to do for them. So in reality, no, I don't regret leaving. But sometimes I think about it.  <b>Faith Pinho: </b><p>Looking back on this story, on 3 years of reporting, the best way I know how to describe the process is that it felt like watching a pendulum swing.</p><p>Its natural, I think, to go from one extreme to the other. And over time, Ive seen that pendulum continue to swing back and forth  just a little less every time. </p><p>Sometimes Paulina was laughing and smoking hookah with her family. Right now, they dont want anything to do with her. Sometimes Paulina and Gina still chat and talk over each other like sisters. Sometimes they resent each other. Sometimes Paulina is glad her daughters get the childhood she never had. Sometimes she thinks she got a better education without being stuck at school all day.<b> </b>Sometimes she feels like fortunetelling is the only thing she knows how to do. Sometimes she feels its the only thing she wants to do.</p><p>Each swing brings her a little closer to the place that feels the most right to her. To a place where her choice and her destiny begin to overlap.</p><p>This was Foretold.</p>Note: The calls to action and the credits are intentionally excluded from this transcript. -LR                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Montaezs campaign to promote his supposed entrepreneurial accomplishment has resulted in numerous public appearances, book deals, and now a biopic that marks the feature directorial debut of multi</p> -<p>hyphenate <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-06-13/eva-longoria-stephanie-beatriz-representation-latino-gap">Eva Longoria</a>.</p><p>Last year, however, The Times published a</p> n investigation meticulously researched piece<p> probing</p> at<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-16/flamin-hot-cheetos-richard-montanez">the veracity of Montaezs hyperbolic claim</a>. </p>R Internal r<p>ecords from Frito-Lay</p>s internal investigation<p> and the account of another employee officially tasked with developing the fiery snack in the late 1980s</p>,<p> categorically disprove his involvement in its creation or even in naming</p>  the product it<p>. </p>But even if likely aware of the inaccuracies around the myth, the filmmakers, including producer DeVon Franklin, who  typically exclusively works on faith-based productions  hence the religious undercurrent throughout the film, simply titled Flamin Hot  chose to carry on.Conceived b B<p>ased on Montaezs 2013 memoir</p> , <p>A Boy, </p>A<p>a Burrito and </p>A<p>a Cookie: </p>f<p>From Janitor to Executive, the screenplay by Linda Yvette Chvez (co-creator of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-02-06/gentefied-netflix-gentrification-los-angeles-boyle-heights">Gentefied</a>) and Lewis Colick takes the subjects version of the events as fact for a larger-than-life fictionalized account, which, like Mexican director Alejandro Gonzlez Irritus </p>most <p>recent</p> project<p> Bardo, could also bear the title <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-11-23/bardo-review-alejandro-g-inarritu-netflix">False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths.</a></p><p>On screen, actor Jesse Garcia (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-aug-04-et-quinceanera4-story.html">Quinceaera</a>) plays Montaez with an unwaveringly winsome attitude. The performance traces</p> the now embattled figure from<p> his youthful days involved with gangs in the 1970s </p>and in<p>to his transition to a responsible family man eager to land a position at the Frito-Lay Rancho Cucamonga plant</p>  and beyond<p>. Flashbacks with Garcias Spanglish voice</p> -<p>over walk us into episodes of racial discrimination in Richards childhood, his fathers abuse, and his lifelong romance with wife Judy (played by Annie Gonzalez).</p><p>In a standout role for an actor regularly seen in more serious parts, Garcia is an utter joy to watch. His disarming lack of cynicism and optimistic disposition while in </p>Montaezs  Richards <p>shoes compel</p>s<p> us to wish the humble characters grand aspirations materialize. May Flamin Hot</p> at least<p> serve as testament to Garcias range and ability to lead a cast. Meanwhile, a marvelous Gonzalez rides a similar wavelength of cheerful determination. A scene where Judy steps in to defend Richard from the judg</p>e<p>ment of his </p> head<p>strong</p>headed<p> father</p> ,<p> Vacho (Emilio Rivera)</p> , and  or<p> another where he credits her for his success brim with earnestness.</p><p>Tonally, Flamin Hot<b> </b>plays like an heir to Chicano classics </p> such as  the likes of<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-04-23/blood-in-blood-out-30th-anniversary">Blood In Blood Out</a> or My Family, which </p> eschewed  never much cared for<p> emotional subtly, yet dignified the Mexican American experience with uplifting themes of pride and unity. Longoria and her actors lean into the cheesiness, pun intended, but not without winking at us in flights of imagination that communicate a layer of calculated mischief. Take as proof the amusing moments </p>where  when Richard Mont aoez<p> daydreams about corporate suits fighting each other using street slang.</p><p>Previously behind the camera on a few TV episodes, Longoria fully flexes her </p>to <p>ability to guide an ensemble into emotionally cohesive scenes. Despite a heavy reliance on snappy, musically driven montages, the end result is visually polished, with bright saturated colors and occasional narrative flourishes that add an unexpectedly idiosyncratic zest to the picture, effectively separating it from</p> other<p> stale</p> r<p> biographical affairs. Yet, while Flamin Hot entices </p> us <p>to want to see more from Longoria the director, its reverential demeanor toward</p>s<p> a corporation for merely considering </p> the input of their  its <p>workers</p> input as <p>valuable disappoints.</p><p>Richards ascent from the factory floor to the rooms of power, as told in Flamin Hot, entailed great tenacity</p> :,<p> first</p> to<p> ask</p> ing<p> his superiors to</p> properly<p> pronounce his last name properly, </p>to <p>then shadow</p> ing<p> seasoned machinist Clarence (Dennis Haysbert)</p>, to  and eventually and <p>distilling his </p> own <p>knowledge of </p>what <p>Latino consumers</p> would respond to<p> into a blend of chilies to coat an array of Frito-Lay products</p> (or so he says)<p>, </p>and  before <p>ultimately breaking the chain of command and </p> taking his concept  reaching out<p> directly to CEO Roger Enrico (Tony Shalhoub)</p>with his concept<p>.</p><p>Platitudes pave Richards personal and professional growth here, but even so, the intention to instill a sense of self-worth and the life-changing potential of perseverance feels noble. Rather than succumb to the white majoritys otherizing perception of his identity, Richard weaponizes the stereotypes, in this case Latinos</p> '<p> preference for potent flavors, in his favor. At its core, the premise sustains that triumph is only worthwhile if earned without compromising your authentic self. Given the disputed details, this now seems a tad ironic.</p><p>No one denies the magnitude of Montaezs rise. That alone merits commendation. But the contested part of his self-enshrined legend, the origination of Flamin Hot Cheetos, is probably the</p> decisive<p> factor that persuaded book publishers and film executives to invest in his story in the first place. In other words, Flamin Hot the movie might not exist if not for that </p> claim. alleged lie. <p>That the on-screen </p>Montaez  Richard<p> repeatedly claims to </p> have <p>embellish</p> ed<p> how events unfolded reads as an admission of guilt or an acknowledgment that versions may differ.</p><p>Taken solely as a product of make-believe, </p> however, and <p>detached from the controversies of the source anecdote, Flamin' Hot turns out to be a surprisingly enjoyable crowd-pleaser. It mostly works because Garcia, Gonzalez</p>,<p> and Longoria agree on a poignant, yet not sanctimonious approach that crystallizes the specific fortitude of mining hope</p> even<p> from dire struggle.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Hernndez sustained the injury midway through the first half of Wednesdays U.S. Open Cup quarterfinal in Sandy, Utah.</p><p>The injury is believed to be a Grade 3 tear, meaning the ligament is completely torn and will likely require surgery to repair. Recovery can take six to nine months but Hernndez is 35 and will be out of contract at the end of the season.</p><p>Hernndez led the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2023-05-30/galaxy-president-chris-klein-out">Galaxy</a> in scoring each of the last two seasons and his 35 goals combined </p>was  were<p> second-best in MLS over that span. He missed the first five games this season with a hamstring injury and has just a goal and an assist in nine appearances this season for the Galaxy (3-9-3), who are last in the 29-team league standings.</p> Galaxy star Chicharito works with 'emotional coach' to achieve his goals<p>Mexicos all-time leading scorer with 52 international goals, Hernndez came to the Galaxy ahead of the 2020 season, signing a three-year contract that paid him more than $19.4 million. With the $9.4-million transfer fee the team had to pay Spanish club Sevilla for the rights to sign Hernndez, the deal cost the Galaxy $28.8 million.</p><p>Performance clauses in the designated-player contract were triggered last year, extending the deal for a fourth season and a guaranteed $7.4 million, making Hernndez the third-highest-paid player in the league. If the Galaxy place Hernndez on the season-ending injury list they can sign another designated player, but because of sanctions levied against the team by MLS last December over violations of the leagues salary rules, the Galaxy are limited as to the type of player they can sign to replace him.</p><p>Hernndez, whose father and grandfather </p>both <p>played in World Cups for the Mexican national team, began his career with the youth program at Chivas of Guadalajara when he was 9, then made his first team debut in 2006. After the 2010 World Cup, </p>in  during <p>which he scored twice in four appearances, Hernndez jumped to Manchester United of the English Premier League, the first stop on a five-team, three-country European tour that would see him play for Real Madrid, Bayern Leverkusen, West Ham United and Sevilla, winning two EPL championships, Europe League and Club World Cup titles and start in a Champions League final.</p><p>He also scored in three separate World Cups, making 109 appearances for Mexico. Including the past two seasons with the Galaxy, Hernndez scored 10 or more goals eight times in 18 first-team club seasons.</p> Chicharito wants to take Galaxy back to familiar spot in final year of contract During On <p>the play in which he was injured Wednesday, Hernndez was charging up the center of the Real Salt Lake defense in the</p>  24th 24th <p>minute when he stretched for a pass from teammate Riqui Puig about 15 yards outside the penalty area. Hernndez, who was not touched on the play, then tumbled to the turf and immediately motioned to the Galaxy bench for help as Puig and three RSL players moved in to console him.</p><p>He was carried off the field and to the locker room, his face covered with a towel and shaking his head, as teammates reached out to pat him on the shoulder. He flew back to Los Angeles with the team and underwent an MRI on Thursday, although the team did not announce the results until Friday morning.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That backlash has largely come in the form of hundreds of new laws designed to erase queer identity and suppress forms of expression, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2023-06-06/la-drag-scene-is-bigger-than-ever-but-it-will-take-rebellion-to-keep-it-safe">such as drag</a>, that buck traditional gender norms.</p><p>More than 20 states have now passed laws banning gender-affirming care for kids. In many of those states, proponents of the bills harped on surgical procedures and permanent medical interventions that aren't even part of the standard care for transgender adolescents. </p><p>At the same time, the legislation they backed targeted more common treatments  including reversible puberty blockers  that medical experts say are vital parts of care for children who suffer from a disconnect between their birth sex and their true identity, and who experience higher rates of depression and suicide when denied such care.</p> Anti-LGBTQ+ laws put U.S. in a state of emergency, Human Rights Campaign says<p>States have also passed and pursued laws and legal opinions threatening the parents of trans children who receive such care, alleging despite all medical consensus that it amounts to child abuse. They have pursued and passed bathroom laws demanding trans people use facilities aligned with their birth sex regardless of their identities; rules barring transgender kids from competing against their peers in sports; and laws precluding discussion of LGBTQ+ topics in schools while forcing teachers to out queer kids who confide in them.</p><p>They have pursued measures that bar drag queens from performing in public, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-05-15/15-most-banned-books-2022-2023">ban books exploring queer themes</a> and deny the very existence of transgender people in laws related to people's sexual rights.</p><p>The laws have created a patchwork of inequity for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S.  denying them healthcare and other basic rights in some states but not others, and forcing them to make devastating, financially difficult decisions about where to live and whom to trust.</p><p>"It is tough," Kai said one day after school, as she waited for neighborhood friends to come play. "I guess I try my best not to have to see these things and learn these things, but when I have to, it really hurts, and it makes everything difficult."</p>Fighting back<p>Leaders and lawmakers in the mostly conservative states passing such laws say they are simply looking out for American kids. They argue children and teens are too young to understand gender or their own identities and are essentially being brainwashed by "woke" adults into damaging their bodies before they're old enough to make such decisions.</p><p>Pushing back is a broad coalition of queer people, medical and legal experts, LGBTQ+ rights groups and liberal leaders  including President Biden.</p><p>Leading medical experts have lamented the politicization of trans healthcare and denounced the efforts of mostly Republican lawmakers to second-guess widely accepted standards of care using quack science. Liberal leaders and lawmakers have accused their conservative counterparts of fear mongering and misusing LGBTQ+ rights as a political wedge.</p><p>Legal rights organizations have flagged 2023 as a watershed year for LGBTQ+ discrimination  with the American Civil Liberties Union tracking nearly 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills nationwide and the Human Rights Campaign last week <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-06/anti-lgbtq-laws-us-state-of-emergency-human-rights-campaign">declaring a "state of emergency" for LGBTQ+ Americans</a>.</p><p>On Thursday, Biden denounced the wave of laws targeting LGBTQ+ people as "callous," "cruel," "hysterical" and "prejudiced," and announced new federal initiatives to protect the queer community  saying that his administration "has their back."</p><p>"LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard," Biden said.</p><p>In addition to speaking out, LGBTQ+ people and their allies are also pushing back, hard, in liberal-leaning statehouses and federal courts  and having some success.</p> The 15 most banned books in America this school year<p>Late in the evening of June 2, Micah Winter  aka drag queen Goldie Dee Collins  was at a big party for the start of Memphis Pride when one of the organizers made an announcement.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/52/d8/ac4697ab44c187934b3bb1e96bf5/ap23154463865703.jpg"></figure><p>This year, Tennessee passed a law that barred "male or female impersonators" from performing anywhere children might be able to see them. The law intentionally targeted drag queens, though it also raised fears for transgender people. Friends of George's, an LGBTQ+ theater troupe in Memphis that Winter is a part of, sued to block the law.</p><p>The news that Friday night was that U.S. District Judge Thomas Parker  an appointee of President Trump  had just issued a ruling <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-03/trump-appointed-judge-rejects-tennessees-anti-drag-law-as-too-broad-too-vague">tossing the law as unconstitutional</a>. It was a major victory in one of the most closely watched battles over LGBTQ+ rights in the country, and "the crowd just went wild," Winter said.</p><p>The rest of Pride weekend, Winter</p>, 31,<p> said, he and other members of Friends of George's were toasted as "hometown heroes." Winter, 31, said he kept telling people the win was all of theirs.</p><p>"I'm a drag queen, so I love attention and spotlight, but I don't want Friends of George's to take all the attention here," Winter said. "We did it for the entire queer community."</p><p>Just days later, attorney Jennifer Levi was celebrating another LGBTQ+ victory.</p> Federal judge temporarily blocks Florida ban on transgender treatment for minors<p>This year, Florida passed a law banning gender-affirming care for transgender adolescents, including reversible treatments that temporarily delay puberty while young teens, in consultation with their parents, therapists and physicians, consider how they'd like their bodies to mature. Levi, who has defended LGBTQ+ rights in U.S. courts for three decades, helped a group of Florida parents with transgender kids sue.</p><p>On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle  an appointee of President Clinton  issued <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-06/us-judge-blocks-florida-ban-on-trans-minor-care-in-narrow-ruling-says-gender-identity-is-real">an order rejecting the state's rationale for the law</a> as unscientific and misinformed, and granting the parents' request to block its enforcement on the grounds that it is likely unconstitutional.</p><p>Levi, 58, called it a "big decision"  one that rejected political bluster in favor of testimony from doctors "who have treated patients and have expertise in this area and who all agree on the essentials of the medical issues."</p><p>Dr. Meredithe McNamara, an assistant professor at Yale School of Medicine who treats trans youths, and Anne Alstott, a law professor at Yale Law School, are part of a multidisciplinary team tracking legal efforts to restrict gender-affirming care across the country. They agreed Hinkle's decision was important.</p><p>According to their research, proponents of gender-affirming care bans across the country have used the same five-step "disinformation playbook," McNamara said: They deny transgender people even exist; falsely claim children are being subjected to irreversible treatments such as surgeries; falsely allege treatments that are being provided to kids are unsafe or unproven; deny that </p>existing<p> care standards are backed by decades of research; and attack the legitimacy of medical authorities who say otherwise.</p><p>McNamara and Alstott said it is sad <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-07/wave-of-anti-trans-laws-reminds-advocates-of-another-struggle-abortion-rights">the strategy has worked in so many state legislatures</a>, where politicians have intentionally ignored rebuttals based in science and medicine, but encouraging that courts are starting to reject such arguments as groundless.</p><p>"What we're seeing in these [gender-affirming care cases] is that when courts hear both sides, they are able to call out misinformation and render sound decisions," Alstott said. "It really has been heartwarming, as a law professor, to see the law work."</p><p>Alstott said that some cases will undoubtedly be appealed and that LGBTQ+ people are justified in worrying about conservative judges  including on the U.S. Supreme Court  upholding anti-LGBTQ+ laws.</p><p>But, she said, she's hopeful that the rule of law  the reliance on facts  will lead to more LGBTQ+ victories.</p>Bolstering community <p>Beyond the courts, LGBTQ+ people and their allies are also pushing back by further enshrining LGBTQ+ rights in bluer states and shoring up supportive communities there.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/88/ca/e088ed1f481383d32a9161b053a9/ap23003733681293.jpg"></figure><p>This year, Minnesota Rep. Leigh Finke, who is transgender, helped rally her colleagues to pass a Trans Refuge law that provides legal protections for individuals seeking or receiving gender-affirming care in the state. Finke said the bill was a necessary counterpoint to those banning such care in neighboring states. </p><p>Finke said she and her office were barraged with angry, vitriolic emails and calls from people who opposed the legislation, but also buoyed by an outpouring of love from supporters.</p><p>"The amount of uplift I have received has been amazing, and just being able to be a part of the movement that we are in right now  it makes me emotional just thinking about it," Finke said. "It's so important for our community right now to have a voice."</p><p>Dr. Angela Kade Goepferd, medical director of the gender health clinic at Children's Minnesota, helped advocate for Finke's bill, along with families and trans kids receiving care at the clinic.</p><p>Goepferd, 45, who is nonbinary, said they felt a duty to use the tremendous medical expertise at Children's to help explain to lawmakers what gender-affirming care actually looks like for kids, and why there is medical consensus around its efficacy.</p><p>Under established standards of care, kids are not getting surgeries. Adolescents reaching puberty may receive reversible puberty blockers, in consultation with their medical teams, to delay their development until they are a bit older. Older teens may elect to start hormone therapies to help align their bodies with their gender identities, but that too is only after intense consultation with medical teams.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/19/78/13da9eaf4123aa3d68b452578da2/gettyimages-1252241338.jpg"></figure><p>"This is an area of medicine that's been around for a while, and that really prior to this kind of manufactured controversy around trans kids and their healthcare, was really not controversial in the fields of pediatrics and medicine," Goepferd said. "It really can be lifesaving."</p><p>For Hao and Gretchen Nguyen, whose 6-year-old daughter, Asher, is trans, having such support at Children's has been vital  and the idea of going without it is terrifying.</p><p>"It gives us the assurance and ease and confidence of knowing that we are having medical professionals guide our path," said Gretchen Nguyen, 36, who is an attorney.</p><p>"These are just basic human rights," said Hao Nguyen, 40, a prosecutor. "For states or the far right or whatever to take those basic human rights and then galvanize them and arm them into political weapons is really kind of disgusting, and it has real impacts on real families."</p> Andy, 43, and Andrea, 44, whose 14-year-old son, B., is transgender, feel the same. They asked to use just their first names, and B.'s first initial, to protect their family from hate. How GOP efforts to restrict trans rights take a page from the antiabortion playbook Andy, a professor, said the idea that B.'s use of gender-affirming care is "somehow impulsive by [B.] or us or that we're pushing some sort of agenda" is ridiculous. In fact, he said, it has been a long, careful process in which B. has been surrounded at every step by a team of doctors. "It's about allowing my child to express their identity," said Andrea, an attorney, "and not suffer mental health consequences needlessly." B., who likes math and rock climbing and plays the cello, said on most days now, he wakes up feeling normal and happily heads off to school like any other kid. That would not be the case, he said, without the care he receives at the clinic. B. is on puberty blockers, which he started after he and his medical team began noticing signs that his body was hitting puberty and about to start changing in feminine ways  which racked him with anxiety. In the national debate around such care, critics argue that puberty blockers harm children by disrupting their natural development. B. said he sees it as quite the opposite. "No one ever points out how much it would hurt me if I  couldn't have gender-affirming care, what irreversible harm  that would cause," he said. "Before I stated puberty blockers, I was starting to get very distressed and anxious about how I looked," he said. "If I didn't have gender-affirming care, I would have to pretend to be someone else all day long. I would never feel like myself, and I wouldn't be happy about the person I would be pretending to be."<p>Goepferd said they see the benefits of gender-affirming care in the smiles of happy kids every day and were tremendously gratified to see the Trans Refuge law pass. But it was also bittersweet, they said, considering the wait to get into their clinic is now a year long and getting only longer as more kids from states banning such care come looking for help.</p><p>"It's a real hard position for all of us to be in," Goepferd said. "We can't be taking entire states' worth of young people who are transgender and shipping them to a different state to get healthcare."</p>In California <p>Among the hundreds of bills being tracked by the ACLU, only one was in California.</p><p>The bill, sponsored by Republican Assemblymen Bill Essayli of </p>Riverside<p> Corona and James Gallagher of Yuba City, would have required school employees to notify parents within three days if their child identified as transgender at school.</p><p>Critics blasted the bill as one that would out and potentially endanger trans children, while violating student privacy protections under California law. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-11/outing-transgender-students-california-bill-dead">The bill died in committee</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/74/e7/d5a91c124c7c8b8fad3e676c18f6/gettyimages-1491419220a.jpg"></figure><p>Essayli said he was disappointed the legislation was labeled "anti-LGBTQ+" and lumped together with other bills targeting queer people across the country. He said his intention was not to target LGBTQ+ kids but ensure that parents are kept in the loop if their kids are struggling with their gender identity.</p><p>"Is every parent going to be accepting immediately? I don't know. Probably not," Essayli said. "But the point is the parents need to be able to go through that journey with their kid."</p><p>Essayli said he figured the bill might not pass in Sacramento, where Republicans are vastly outnumbered by Democrats, but wanted to put it forward anyway to pressure state officials into providing more clarity around the issue.</p><p>"I know there's a lot of parents who are very interested in this," Essayli said, "and they're going to be going to their local school boards and asking for some clarity and some guidance."</p><p>Schools and school boards are already an LGBTQ+ battleground in the state.</p><p>In recent weeks, the idea of celebrating LGBTQ+ pride in schools has sparked violent protests <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/parents-protest-lgbtq-pride-day-los-angeles-saticoy-elementary-school">outside an elementary school in North Hollywood</a> and a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">school board meeting in Glendale</a>.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has intentionally positioned himself as an </p>LGBTQ+<p> ally willing to stand up to other leaders  including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican  who are threatening LGBTQ+ rights elsewhere in the country.</p><p>In a recent video celebrating Pride month, Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, lauded California's efforts to bolster LGBTQ+ rights  including around gender-affirming care  while criticizing states that are moving in the opposite direction.</p><p>"All across the United States, you're seeing other states that are targeting people simply, well, for existing, threatening their healthcare, their livelihood, and threatening their freedoms," Newsom said over an image of DeSantis.</p><p>"California, we're not going to let that happen," Newsom said. "We're doubling down on our pride in the LGBTQ+ community."</p>Looking ahead<p>How the culture war around gender-affirming care and other LGBTQ+ issues will play out in the long run is anyone's guess. But many LGBTQ+ people say they aren't taking any chances.</p><p>Eli, 29, and Lucas, 26, an engaged transgender couple who asked to be referred to only by their first names for safety reasons, were born and raised in Florida and still live there, close to many of their family and friends. But they are planning on uprooting their lives and moving to Minnesota this fall, Eli said.</p><p>The anti-LGBTQ+ laws DeSantis has signed in recent months  including one that makes it illegal for trans people to use public restrooms matching their identities  have gone too far, he said. Lucas' healthcare provider recently notified patients that it intended to stop providing gender-affirming care in the state, leaving the couple scrambling to find a new provider. They don't want to live anymore in a state where such threats loom around every corner, Eli said.</p><p>The move won't be easy. Eli will be able to keep his remote job as an internet repair and technical specialist, but Lucas will have to leave their job in financial aid. Still, the couple are hopeful.</p><p>"We're just looking to be ourselves," Eli said, "in a society that accepts us."</p><p>For Kimberly Shappley and 12-year-old Kai, the future evokes both hope and fear. </p><p>Kai  who likes drawing, knitting, acting and Dolly Parton and is the co-author of <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/joy-to-the-world-kai-shappleylisa-bunker?variant=40685973307426" target="_blank">a published book about a transgender cheerleader in Texas</a>  is in a public school in Connecticut that she likes, and said things have been going great.</p><p>Bubbling with confidence, she said she pictures a future in which she's famous  which seems possible, considering her charisma.</p><p>"What's there not to like?" she said, when asked what it's like to be her. "I mean, I'm fabulous."</p><p>Shappley is still working as a tele-medicine nurse with the same company she worked for in Texas, and is getting used to Connecticut too, she said. But she's also worried about the next presidential election and attacks on LGBTQ+ and transgender rights spreading, and is trying to save money  just in case the family has to move again.</p><p>"We can't settle," she said, clearly frustrated.

The second, authored by Solis and Supervisor Janice Hahn, creates an advisory commission focused exclusively on <a href="https://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/bos/supdocs/181224.pdf" target="_blank">advancing LGBTQ+ policies</a>.</p><p>In the last year, conservative lawmakers have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-03-29/experts-worry-dont-say-gay-bills-promote-hate">flooded</a> statehouses with bills targeting gay, lesbian, nonbinary and transgender youth. These have included proposals to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-22/book-bans-soaring-schools-new-laws-republican-states">ban books</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-19/florida-expands-dont-say-gay-through-12th-grade-while-house-oks-anti-lgbtq-bills">outlaw classroom discussions</a> on sexual orientation and gender identity, and bar<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-04-20/house-passes-trans-athlete-ban-for-girls-and-womens-teams"> trans athletes</a> from competing. Solis said she wanted the two motions to set the county apart from these legislatures targeting the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>Those bills are absolutely, in my opinion, unconscionable, Solis said. Let's stand firm and make sure that we dont go in the opposite direction and allow for hateful policies to be expanded.</p><p>County leaders have six months to form<b> </b>the 15-person commission responsible for advising the </p> board and <p>countys over 30 departments on policies, budgets and programs that will </p> support<p> the LGBTQ+ community. Each supervisor will nominate two people and the countys other three elected officials  the sheriff, the district attorney, and the county assessor  will pick one person. Two members will be picked through an application process.</p><p>Supervisor Holly Mitchell called for the commission to include transgender, gender-nonconforming, intersex, and non</p>-<p>binary appointees.</p><p>The county already has more than 30 commissions, some of which deal with LGBTQ+ issues. The county's <a href="https://hrc.lacounty.gov/about-us/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Commission on Human Relations</a>, for example, </p> develops<p> programs to address homophobia, among other initiatives. The commission's most recent <a href="https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/0234f496-d2b7-00b6-17a4-b43e949b70a2/caa802e9-00f0-455e-9c44-db7ef7a06e4c/2021%20LA%20County%20Hate%20Crime%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on hate crimes found there were 41 anti-transgender crimes in 2021  the vast majority of them violent. The majority of hate crimes toward</p>s<p> gay men were also violent. </p><p>Unlike other county commissions, this one will be composed exclusively of people who identify as LGBTQ+, according to the motion. </p><p>Having an entity made up of individuals who know and have experienced the unique struggles that are common to the LGBTQ+ community is vital, the motion said. This commission will allow the county to see this community through its own lens and understand the many overlapping challenges they often experience.</p><p>County supervisors also noted Tuesday the number of bills introduced across the nation <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-06-13/trans-youth-healthcare-state-bans">criminalizing</a> doctors and families seeking gender-affirming healthcare. Supervisors said they wanted to bolster these very services curtailed in other states </p> through a motion<p> strengthening coordination between county departments that can play a role in offering gender-affirming healthcare. </p><p>Horvath said these services would include providing HIV prevention drugs PrEP and PEP as well as puberty blockers for transgender youth.</p><p>"We must re-dedicate ourselves as an entire county and know this is a responsibility we all have," she said. "This is not a responsibility that is placed on the shoulders of the LGBTQ+ community to fight by themselves." </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Several Los Angeles police officers were justified when they <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-20/lapd-releases-body-cam-video-from-shootings-of-two-armed-men">shot at and killed a man who brandished a handgun</a>, but six of their colleagues broke department policy by joining in the barrage of gunfire last July, according to a police oversight panel. </p><p>The civilian Police Commission found late last month</p> <p>that four of the 10 officers  Luis Avalos, Garrett Vanhooser, Christopher Gonzalez and Chad Heistermann  who opened fire on Rudolfo Torres were within policy. The commission voted </p> at that time<p> to approve a report by Police Chief Michel Moore, summarizing an internal investigation of the incident.</p><p>But the chief's report found that the deadly force used by the rest of the</p> <p>officers who opened fire</p>d<p> during the confrontation </p>incident<p> a year ago </p>  Christopher Burke, J<p>ose Rodriguez, Kyle Bender, James Stea, Israel Florez and Chad Fillinger </p>  <p> "was not proportional, objectively reasonable, or necessary."</p> LAPD releases body-cam video from shootings of two armed men<p>In fact, the report on Torres' death weighed whether the incident might have been a case of "contagious fire"  a phenomenon in which an officer mistakes colleagues' shots as coming from a suspect, prompting them to open fire.</p><p>In all, 31 shots were discharged, with officers firing between one and five shots each, the report said. Some officers who were present did not fire.</p><p>While acknowledging that the shooting unfolded amid "a difficult situation," Moore wrote in a report that the designated cover officers at the scene were "better positioned to address the lethal threat" than some of the officers who ultimately fired. During such encounters, only certain officers are assigned the role of cover officers. </p><p>Moore also agreed with the majority of an internal review board that concluded a supervisor at the scene, Sgt. </p>Christopher <p>Burke, didn't need to fire his service weapon and would have been better served by staying back and assigning clear roles to the other officers.</p>While <p>Though it concluded that the four officers' shots were in policy, the board took into account the "number of officers that discharged their service pistols, as well as the number of rounds fired," according to Moore's report.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-08-20/lapd-releases-body-cam-video-from-shootings-of-two-armed-men">shooting occurred on the night of July 2, 2022</a>, when Newton Division gang officers encountered Torres in the area of 37th </p> Street <p>and Maple Avenue.</p><p>While speaking to Torres, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs, officers became convinced he was armed and ordered him to </p>get<p> take his hands out of his pockets, police said. Further raising their suspicions, officers said, Torres was acting fidgety and was wearing an oversized, baggy sweatshirt on a warm night. </p><p>According to the chief's report, one of the officers recognized Torres from a previous run-in as a member of the 36th Street gang who went by the nickname Marbles. The decades-old gang operates in the surrounding area, which is sometimes called the "Low Bottoms," police said.</p><p>When they ordered him to stop, Torres ignored the command and started walking away, prompting a surreal, slow-motion pursuit through nearby streets, with officers trailing several feet behind and using a patrol vehicle as cover.</p><p>After following Torres on foot for several blocks, officers tried to apprehend him. Edited police <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MRAIeicWMg&amp;t=661s" target="_blank">body camera video </a>shows that officers shot him once with a hard foam projectile, sending him tumbling. As he fell, a gun he had apparently been holding under his coat clattered to the ground, according to the report. When he picked it back up, the officers opened fired, the report says.</p><p>Officers involved gave differing accounts of whether they saw Torres point the gun in their direction or simply raise it.</p><p>The 30-year-old was pronounced dead at a</p>n area<p> hospital.</p><p>"Regardless of whether Torres was raising the handgun or pointing it, the board opined that it was reasonable for the officers to believe that he had the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to them and that his action had to be instantly confronted and addressed," Moore wrote in his report.</p><p>According to the report, police recovered a loaded .40-caliber pistol with no serial number and an extended magazine with 31 bullets. They also recovered another extended magazine, a .9mm, AR-style pistol and a 50-round drum magazine inside a backpack Torres was carrying.</p>While <p>Though the chief's report concluded that some officers were justified in using deadly force against an armed suspect, it disapproved of some of the tactics employed leading up to the shooting. </p><p>Some of the officers who fired should have sought cover behind the patrol vehicle's bulletproof doors, the report said. Other officers were cited for occasionally placing their fingers on the trigger of their guns  in violation of department policy that dictates officers should </p>only <p>do so only when prepared to fire.</p><p>Echoing the review board, the report also faulted Burke for failing to take an "active leadership role." Instead, the report said, the sergeant seemed "overly involved in Torres actions, which seemed to limit his ability to effectively manage his personnel."</p><p>Toxicology results from an autopsy </p>conducted after his death <p>found the presence of alcohol, amphetamine and methamphetamine in Torres blood, according to the report.</p><p>Since the shooting, relatives of Torres have continued to question the officers' motive for the stop.</p> Since the shooting, Torres' brother, Javier, said he has heard from neighborhood residents who said his brother's death was part of a larger pattern of profiling and harassment by Newton Division officers. "There's been a continuous targeting of Latino and African Americans in this community," said Javier Torres, a high school teacher in Oakland. "It has been nonstop and I think since my brother's killing, his murder by LAPD, we have seen many, many murders" by police. Even though his brother was armed, Javier Torres said police could have done more to defuse  diffuse the situation. His brother should have been arrested and "put through the process" rather than killed, he said. He also questioned why officers fired so many shots in the encounter.<p>LAPD officials said during a presentation in April before the Police Commission that they have tried to address high-volume gunfire incidents by restricting the number of officers who can have their guns drawn during an encounter with a suspect. </p><p>Deputy Chief Marc Reina told commissioners at the time that the department is developing a new virtual reality training course for officers intended to re-create the stress levels of firing their weapons in a fast-changing environment where they have to account for countless factors.</p><p>In a separate investigation, the department late last month also cleared two officers who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-06-20/police-fatally-shoot-armed-man-after-alleged-carjacking-in-pacoima">shot and killed an armed man in Pacoima last June</a> after he allegedly tried to force someone out of a car at gunpoint.</p> Police fatally shoot armed man after carjacking in Pacoima<p>Officers Christopher Kliebert and Andrew Mejia were justified in using deadly force against 24-year-old Oscar Santiago, who brandished a gun at police a short time after the attempted carjacking. Police also released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Tdo48GMe2k" target="_blank">video from the encounter.</a></p><p>However, a review board concluded that another officer in Kliebert's and Mejia's shoes would have also considered Santiago a threat, after he raised a gun in their direction. Police initially said that Santiago fired first, but a subsequent investigation revealed that officers were the first to shoot, according to a report.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"Making the Hollywood Support Staff Relief Fund a permanent emergency fund gives these workers a much-needed resource that wasnt available before."</p><p>The WGA has its own fund to assist writers during the strike.

Buy some air purifiers. Put on that KN95 mask. Just because you cant see the threat doesnt mean its not there.</p>This is just some of the wisdom <p>West Coasters who have long lived with the danger of wildfires offered </p> some words of wisdom to <p>their East Coast counterparts Wednesday, as residents along the Eastern seaboard faced another dizzying day of hazy skies </p> amid <p>smoke and air pollution from wildfires burning in Canada.</p><p>Tens of millions of Americans were <a href="https://www.weather.gov/">under air quality alerts</a>, stretching from parts of western Missouri to New York, from Maine to South Carolina, where particulate levels were expected to enter unhealthful territory and many residents experienced the scratchy throats and irritated eyes and lungs that wildfire smoke can cause.</p><p>By afternoon, the <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/world-air-quality-ranking" target="_blank">IQAir World Air Quality Index</a> ranked New York City No. 1 for the worst air quality on the planet for the second straight day, ahead of global cities </p> such as <p>New Delhi, </p>India,<p> where such conditions are more common. </p><p>The air quality index in New York continued to deteriorate </p> as the day went onWednesday<p>, </p>climbing soaring<p> from below 200 </p> to above 400 by late afternoon,in the morning to 413 by 4:30 p.m. Eastern time 324<p> according to AirNow.gov, which offers real-time tracking of AQI. </p> New York City Mayor Eric Adams said  in a news conference Wednesday evening that at 5 p.m.,  Eastern the AQI had hit 484, "the highest level index of our knowledge since the '60s." <p>Values of 301 or higher are considered hazardous, </p> a level at which<p> the Environmental Protection Agency warns that everyone is more likely to be affected, spurring a health warning of emergency conditions. </p> Canada wildfires are leading to air-quality alerts in the U.S. Here's why there is so much smoke The conditions were predicted to worsen into Thursday, with a reprieve expected Friday, but Adams warned that the situation is changing daily.  "Smoke predictability that far out is low," he said. "We cannot provide guidance more than a day in advance at this point."  He continued to advise <p>vulnerable residents, including older New Yorkers, those with heart and breathing problems and children, to stay indoors and wear high-quality </p>KN95 <p>masks if they needed to venture outside. </p> Gov. Kathy Hochul said that approximately 1 million N95-style masks would be made available at state-owned facilities. New York City's <p><a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSchools/status/1666387607264059392?s=20">public schools,      which        were open  </a></p>  Wednesday and kept students indoors, will be closed Thursday because of a previously scheduled closure, Adams said. Beaches would remain closed because of poor visibility, and other outdoor activities around the city would also be canceled, he said, adding that drivers were urged to maintain caution on the roads.  "Our city is strong and resilient," Adams said. "We have faced crisis before, and we will get through this together."  Hochul on Wednesday <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT0hfR6tYoc" target="_blank">warned residents</a> </p> statewide that the situation was a "crisis" that could last  stretch for days. "This is typically a West Coast phenomena," she said, emphasizing that people need to stay indoors whenever possible.  Canadian wildfire smoke spreads hazardous haze through northeastern U.S.<p>The sky in New York grew more ominous and darker </p> during the day<p> as <a href="https://twitter.com/nymetrowx/status/1666479008899293187">smoke overpowered much of the city</a>, </p>and <p>shroud</p> ing<p> the five boroughs in a deep, orange glow </p> and disrupting activities<p>, </p> from professional sports to theater. <p>Wednesday night's <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceBeck4NY/status/1666542242360696835" target="_blank">MLB game between</a> the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox was postponed one night after the teams faced off under an ashen sky.

Philadelphia's airport also was brought to a ground stop, the agency said. </p> New Yorkers said the smell of smoke, similar to that of a campfire, was so overwhelming that they could not step outside without coughing or their eyes burning. Many wore masks as they commuted across the boroughs and shared photos of the ashen sky from landmarks across the city.  Other parts of the state  and nation  were also blighted by hazardous AQI levels<p>. In Binghamton, which registered 400 AQI before midday, visibility was reduced to just one mile.</p> In Washington,  D.C., a haze settled across the National Mall, and the city <p><a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-urges-residents-follow-recommendations-related-code-red-air-quality-alert" target="_blank">was under a "code red" alert,</a></p>  triggered when the AQI breaches 150 and vulnerable groups are at particular risk.

We have it every year, but not every place has it so bad," Johnson said, adding the El Dorado fire was especially scary and felt like uncharted territory, even for the most experienced. So Johnson shared tips on Twitter, including advising car owners and homeowners to replace their air filters  now and after the fires. </p><p>"Theyre doing some heavy lifting right now and you want them effective, <a href="https://twitter.com/sherellesays/status/1666269020486791168">Johnson said.</a> Other tips included keeping windows closed, downloading smartphone apps that measure AQI and making sure to stay hydrated, including </p>for<p> your pets. </p><p>S.E.

If you feel tired, cranky, or out of sorts, you are probably feeling the smoke!</p> Some have pointed out the indifference some New Yorkers have to the constant threat West Coast residents face from wildfires every year  until it knocked on their own door.

The agency closed the application portal at the end of March 2022. </p><p>A surge in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-03-17/rental-assistance-in-california-how-to-apply-deadlines">denials beginning after the closure</a> propelled advocates to sue, alleging that eligible renters were rejected and left without financial aid. By July, around <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/ca-rental-assistance">30%</a> of applicants had been denied assistance from the program, even though</p> <p><a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/CARentalAssistance">93%</a> were likely </p> <p>eligible for debt relief, according to </p> the <p>National Equity Atlas, an organization that reports on racial and economic equity.</p><p>The way the program was set up was not responsive to the population it was meant to serve, </p> said <p>Faizah Malik, senior staff attorney at Public Counsel, a nonprofit law firm that helped represent the community advocacy organizations that sued the state.</p><p>Tenant advocates <a href="https://wclp.org/press-release-lawsuit-filed-against-ca-hcd-for-violating-due-process-rights-in-emergency-rental-assistance-program/" target="_blank">sued</a> the housing department </p> in June 2022<p> for distributing funds through an application process they characterized as muddled with barriers for low-income and vulnerable individuals unfamiliar with navigating government bureaucracy. Tenants found long waits, language and technological barriers, and vague explanations if they were denied assistance, according to lawyers involved in the settlement. The settlement requires the department to make several changes to its system for pending relief applications and </p> to <p>provide tenants with the information they need to appeal.</p><p>More than <a href="https://publiccounsel.org/litigation/acce-v-hcd/" target="_blank">100,000</a> households are waiting to hear whether they will receive rent relief, according to a data analysis by Public Counsel.</p><p>"Ultimately, the petitioners and [the Department of Housing and Community Development] chose to settle the litigation to move the program forward with the shared goal of assisting Californians, department officials said in a</p>n emailed<p> statement to </p> T<p>he </p>Los Angeles<p> Times. We are committed to working with our partners to bring resolution and support to those remaining in the application pipeline.</p><p>The settlement comes as </p> the city of <p>Los Angeles' </p>Citys <p><a href="https://housing.lacity.org/highlights/renter-protections" target="_blank">first rent repayment period ends on Aug. 1</a>  the deadline for tenants to pay rental debt accumulated between March 2020 and September 2021.</p><p>According to the complaint, tenants often received rent relief denials that amounted to a few words, such as nonresponsive, inconsistent</p>,<p> or unverifiable information. Without more detailed explanations, tenants werent sure why they were denied or how to appeal successfully, the advocates suing the state said.</p><p>Applicants who did not speak English received little assistance, while others were denied for a single missing document from the long list of papers required for verification, Malik said. Many tenants do not have formal leases, she added, which also caused denials.</p><p>Low-income older adults who are not used to dealing with online technology similarly found the application process insurmountably difficult, said Cynthia Strathmann, executive director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, one of the organizations that sued the state. These individuals often didnt have emails or laptops, struggled to remember their passwords and didnt know how to log in to their portals.</p><p>The housing department's call center provided little, if any, help, Malik said: Tenants would call dozens of times, and nobody would answer. People who did answer did not always have authority to enter the portal.</p><p>Whats more, many tenants were evicted after they applied for funding but before they received it, said Madeline Howard, </p> s<p>enior </p> a<p>ttorney at Western Center on Law &amp; Poverty, one of the law groups that helped file</p>d<p> the lawsuit. The state had no mechanism to track people who were evicted while awaiting assistance, Howard added.</p><p>Valeria De La Luz said she accumulated over $30,000 in rent debt during the pandemic. The Los Angeles resident, who </p>only <p>speaks </p> only <p>Spanish, applied for rental assistance in November 2021. She was approved, she said, but the next day the decision switched to a denial due to insufficient evidence that she qualified. De La Luz submitted an appeal in March 2022, but has yet to hear from the housing department.</p><p>I dont feel safe at home, De La Luz said in an interview with </p> T<p>he </p>LA <p>Times.</p><p>On top of mounting debt and debacles with her landlord, De La Luz said she lost her job due to the pandemic and has been diagnosed with several health issues. She says she hesitates to receive the surgery she needs because she has no safe place to recover.</p><p>I do have some peace and quiet</p> .<p> I feel a little bit of a relief, but I am not calling this a win because I still have not gotten the funds that I was promised, De La Luz said. I know that Im not the only one.</p><p>Landlords, especially those who manage</p>d<p> small properties and are eligible for the relief, are also celebrating the settlement after losing several years of rental income during the pandemic. Debra Carlton, </p> e<p>xecutive </p> v<p>ice </p> p<p>resident of the California Apartment Ass</p>ociatio<p>n</p> .<p>, said she still expects some landlord applicants will receive denials. </p><p>It's been much harder on the smaller owners who can't balance it out with other tenants, she said. </p><p><b>The </b></p> <b>s</b><p><b>ettlement</b></p><p>Tenants who applied for the rental aid before the end of March 2022 and were denied by June 7 of that year or who have pending applications should expect to receive an update about their applications in the coming months, according to a </p>press  news <p>release</p> from June 5<p>.</p> <p><a href="https://publiccounsel.org/ca-rent-relief/">For many tenants</a>, </p> t<p>he housing department is required to issue new, more detailed denial notices. Applicants who are denied assistance will have 30 days to appeal.</p><p>Additionally, the settlement requires the state agency to make the appeals process easier, fix language barriers, and conduct an audit of denials from March to May 2022 due to "non-responsiveness." The department is also required under the legal agreement to fund local, community-based programs to help tenants navigate the appeals process.</p><p>Howard said that plaintiff lawyers and their clients will meet with the housing department every two weeks for three months, and then monthly to ensure that there is open communication in case problems arise.</p><p>In a February court filing, the housing department said it had some $300 million in state and federal funds left to administer.</p><p>Despite the settlement, rent debt left over from the pandemic will remain a source of stress, eviction</p>,<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-28/rising-homelessness-in-the-latino-community">and homelessness</a>, Malik said, as renters have still been accruing debt after the application portal closed in March 2022.</p><p>This settlement doesn't mean that this issue is gone, she said.</p>For <p>Tenants and landlords with pending applications</p>, you<p> can access Public Counsel's FAQ at <a href="https://publiccounsel.org/ca-rent-relief/" target="_blank">www.carentrelief.org</a> or call Housing </p> I<p>s Key's call center at </p> (<p>833</p> )<p> 343-2122.

But those efforts resumed in 2022, when Democrats nonetheless lost key House races in some heavily </p>Hispanic Latino<p> areas.</p><p>The shift toward Republicans was particularly pronounced in Florida, where over half of </p>Hispanic Latino<p> voters backed Republican Gov.

Per the suit, at no point did Allen disclose that he was planning to film their sexual encounter.

Upon returning home, she took Allens phone to her local police department and reported the assault and the surreptitious recording. </p><p>The local police department told her they would report the incident to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.</p> Allens attorney did not immediately respond to The Times request for comment regarding the second lawsuit filed Friday.<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-11/jimmie-allen-sued-for-alleged-sexual-assault-sex-trafficking">Allen denied any wrongdoing</a> when The Times reached out for comment regarding the first lawsuit filed by his former manager.</p><p>It is deeply troubling and hurtful that someone I counted as one of my closest friends, colleagues and confidants would make allegations that have no truth to them whatsoever, Allen told The Times. I acknowledge that we had a sexual relationship  one that lasted for nearly two years. During that time, she never once accused me of any wrongdoing, and she spoke of our relationship and friendship as being something she wanted to continue indefinitely.</p> " Allen said that his manager hired a lawyer to reach out for money after things ended between them, which led him to question her motives.The simple fact is, her accusations are not only false, but also extremely damaging ," he added. "Ive worked incredibly hard to build my career, and I intend to mount a vigorous defense to her claims and take all other legal action necessary to protect my reputation. Elizabeth Fegan, the attorney representing both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, said "that is categorically not true," in a statement to The Times. Fegan also said that a payout was never requested; however, on Friday, she confirmed that both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 are seeking unspecified monetary damages in the lawsuits, which will be decided by the court<p>.</p>  The only ask we made of Allen and his legal counsel was to meet to discuss Allens behavior and resolution of our clients claims. At no time did our client make a monetary demand. The response was a hard no, and colored with threats that his team would take steps to publicly tarnish my client. My client had no choice but to be proactive in protecting herself by filing the complaint.Only after things ended between us, did she hire a lawyer to reach out and ask for money, which leads me to question her motives. The simple fact is, her accusations are not only false, but also extremely damaging. Ive worked incredibly hard to build my career, and I intend to mount a vigorous defense to her claims and take all other legal action necessary to protect my reputation.Allens attorney did not immediately respond to The Times request for comment regarding the second lawsuit filed Friday.moved upElizabeth Fegan, managing partner of Fegan Scott and the attorney representing both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in  the two lawsuits ,litigation concerning Jimmie Allen told The Times that since  Since <p>Jane Doe filed her case last month,</p>  Fegan's law<p> firm has heard from others who share similar experiences </p> with Allen, she said<p>.</p> After sexual assault: A guide to the exams, your rights and your choices<p>Jane Doe 2s filing demonstrates to me that there is a vivid, distinct pattern of behavior. We intend to show its a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and ultimately of force, Fegan said </p> Friday in an email.<p> The law is clear  anyone who has given consent in sexual activity has the right and the ability to revoke consent at any time. Just as no means no, stop means stop. If one participant doesnt stop, it is sexual assault.</p>The attorney told <p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/jimmie-allen-accused-sexual-assault-filming-sex-lawsuit-1235637548/" target="_blank">Variety</a></p> that after her first clients lawsuit was filed last month, she was contacted by Jill Doe, the friend that the woman had called after allegedly fleeing Allens suite in Las Vegas. The friend said she had seen the sexual assault allegations against Allen, and eventually, Jane Doe 2 agreed to come forward.A predator can only have two defenses: one is consent, and one is that it didnt happen, Fegan told Variety. The more women that come forward, the more they cant claim it didnt happen, and the less likely it is that its consensual. It shows a pattern of deceit, manipulation and ultimately, a pattern of force. <p>Allen, who auditioned for the 10th season of American Idol in 2011 but was cut before the live rounds, has been slowly climbing the country music ladder over the </p> l<p>ast decade. In 2021</p> ,<p> he won the CMA </p> Aa<p>ward for new artist of the year, the second Black artist ever to land the honor.</p><p>In April, Allen and wife Alexis Gale announced via social media that they were calling it quits after three years of marriage, but also revealed that Gale was pregnant with their third child. A week after the first </p> law<p>suit was filed</p> ,<p> Allen <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jimmie-allen-apology-wife-alexis-gale-affair-1235332347/" target="_blank">released a statement</a> on social media</p>, apologizing to his pregnant wife for addressing <p>what he called an "affair" and seemingly </p> blamingblamed <p>the </p> music<p> industry for his behavior. </p><p>I want to publicly apologize to my wife Alexis for humiliating her with my affair. Im embarrassed that my choices have brought shame on her. Thats something that she did not deserve at all, he </p> saidbegan<p>, adding that he wanted to apologize for being a poor example of a man to his children. </p><p>The business takes so much from you. Its full of temptations that can cripple you and ruin everything youve built. Im ashamed that I wasnt strong enough to withstand them. I will no longer be a victim of my weaknesses.</p><p>Fallout came swiftly for the Grammy-nominated country musician. </p> Aside from being dropped by his record label,   . In the last month, <p>he was </p>dropped from his label BBR Music, <p>terminated by his publicist, United Talent Agency severed ties </p> with him<p>, he was removed from </p> Sunday's the <p>CMA Fest lineup </p>for a June 11 performance <p>in Nashville and dropped as the commencement speaker at Delaware State Universitys graduation ceremony. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

McLaughlin-Levrone, the New Jersey native who has trained primarily in Los Angeles under <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2023-05-26/bobby-kersee-track-sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-olympics">coach Bobby Kersee</a> for two years, ran the 400 meters in 49.17 seconds.</p> DuringAmid <p>the Paris</p> ian<p> stop of the Diamond League, the sports highest-profile circuit, that saw the fastest times ever run by Faith Kipyegon in the womens 1,500 meters, Lamecha Girma in the mens 3,000-meter steeplechase and Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the mens two-mile, McLaughlins second-place finish was no less intriguing. It was a preview of what could be the second chapter of a career that already claims two Olympic gold medals and three world championships.</p><p>I was very pleased, </p>Bobby <p>Kersee</p>, McLaughlin-Levrones coach,<p> said in a phone interview with The Times after the race. She did exactly what I asked her to do and the things that went wrong, I know what I could do to correct it and get her ready for our national championships."</p><p>By virtue of her world championships title last summer, McLaughlin-Levrone owns an automatic berth in the 400 hurdles for the next world championships, </p>held in  set for<p> August in Hungary. Kersee said he will know her recovery early next week </p> and<p> whether McLaughlin-Levrone will compete again before the U.S. championships</p>, held on<p> July 6-9. </p>But <p>With her automatic bid in their back pocket, Kersees focus has been on trying McLaughlin-Levrone this summer in the </p>open <p>400 </p> meters<p> and opened the possibility for competing in both. Whether she runs both or not at the world championships is something shes still deciding, McLaughlin-Levrone told reporters in Paris on Wednesday.</p><p>That build-up, and the dearth of chances to see her race, is why Friday </p>into  became<p> a highly anticipated debut.&nbsp;</p><p>Running sub-50 the first time out, [personal record], and going out as hard as she did for me, Im pleased, Kersee said.</p><p>Only 10 women have run a 400 faster than McLaughlin-Levrones season-opener Friday since 2021, a span that includes an Olympics and world championships, leaving her among a select class of athletes whose times could theoretically reach the final of a world championship. She sprinted hard through the races first half but was eventually caught by Marileidy Paulino, the Olympic and world championships silver medalist.</p><p>Watching the race at his home, Edwin Moses, the famed 400-meter hurdler who won 122 consecutive races between 1977 and 1987, said it reminded him exactly of an open 400 meters he raced in Belgium in 1977 in which he started fast but faded.</p><p>It was a lesson, he said, of the stark differences between the events that share a distance but biomechanically are completely different animals, he said. The hurdles rewards speed but also precision  the number of steps between hurdles, the right technique to clear a hurdle and land. The open 400 hinges on turning the feet over as fast as possible and maintaining it. It can lead to a different level of fatigue, Moses said.</p><p>It's great training for the 400 hurdles because the kind of fatigue that I know she experienced, she's going to experience that between the ninth and the 10th hurdles so that's the upside of it, that she ran a race in which she will feel like she's going to feel in the 400 hurdles, Moses said. If she continues to do 400 hurdles that might be a big plus for her.&nbsp;</p><p>Fridays season-opening race for McLaughlin-Levrone showed reasons for optimism of her potential in the open 400, the grip that existing 400-meter specialists still hold on the event and the technical gap she must overcome for a</p>ny future<p> record attempt.</p><p>I just got through talking to her and she feels the difference in terms of the technique with the 400 versus the 400 hurdles," Kersee said. "And it gives her something to wrap her mind around now in practice, to understand the technical differences in what you've got to do in the latter half of the race in the open 400 versus the 400 hurdles.</p>Those <p>Some within the sport and Kersees training group believe Marita Kochs 1985 world record of 47.60 seconds, which no athlete has come within a half-second of breaking</p> since<p>, could one day be within reach  an optimism that partly springs from her 47.91-second leg on the U.S. gold-medal 4x400-meter relay at Julys world championships, which was historys seventh-fastest womans relay split, according to statistician Mark Butler.&nbsp;</p><p>In May, McLaughlin-Levrone said that her first thought after setting the new 400 hurdles world record last summer of 50.68 seconds was intense pain. One of her next emotions was relief. She had felt the intense </p>outside <p>scrutiny and expectations that followed her into last years championships after setting the world record only weeks earlier.</p><p>Getting over the mental hurdle of getting through that race, that was like the victory, she said.</p><p>Her race Friday showed why no shortage of hype will </p>again <p>follow her into Augusts world championships. McLaughlin-Levrone said she ultimately wants to define herself against her own expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, people are looking at the 400 record, maybe moving to the shorter, moving to the 200, so on and so forth, McLaughlin-Levrone said in May. But honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I just want to run and see how fast I can run every single day. Whether I break records or don't break records, or win this or win that, like everyday, to me, it's a mental hurdle of I don't always want to do this, but I'm going to do this and being able to push myself to do things that I didn't think I was capable of.</p><p>And that sounds like a very generic answer, but it's the honest truth. I think when you place too many expectations on yourself, you put yourself in a position to be, I don't know, defined by them if you don't reach them. And I don't want to do that.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

tuition increases of hundreds of dollars per student as the 23-campus system attempts to close a funding gap of almost $1.5 billion. </p><p>The tuition proposal, submitted to the California State Student </p>Association Assn.<p> last month, outlined three models, with the increase </p>per student for each undergraduate<p> ranging from $174 to $462 in the first year and each subsequent year bringing another increase. </p><p>The $1.5-billion shortfall was detailed in a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-26/new-cal-state-report-suggests-tuition-hikes-finding-1-5-billion-funding-gap">70-page report</a> presented to the university's Board of Trustees. In the 2021-2022 school year, there was a 14% disparity between what the system spent and what it actually cost to educate students, pay salaries and keep campuses running, the report said. </p><p>Officials say that despite the proposed tuition increases, which would start in the 2024-2025 school year, a Cal State education will remain affordable  a key value for a system that prides itself as an agent of social mobility. </p><p>But for students already struggling to get by, even a small increase could be a significant burden.</p><p>Nearly half of the systems undergraduates receive Pell Grants  federal money awarded to students who demonstrate exceptional financial need  and nearly one-third are the first in their families to attend college.</p><p>Current undergraduate tuition is $5,742 per year, which has remained mostly flat over the last decade and is among the lowest in the country, according to the system.</p><p>Under the proposal, about</p> <p>60% of CSU students would still have their full tuition covered by financial aid.</p><p>Cal State trustees are expected to vote on the proposed tuition increases, which are projected to generate $333 million to $782 million in revenue by 2028-2029, in the fall. </p><p>This is a lot like climate change, said Julia Lopez, the CSU Board of Trustees member who helped lead the team that worked on the report. If we dont heed the warning signs right now, were going to find ourselves in a world of hurt down the line.</p><p>Miya Haley, a spokesperson for the California State Student </p>Association Assn.<p>, said the organization, which represents the systems 460,000 students, is still reviewing the proposal and gathering input from students.</p><p>While we cannot provide an immediate response regarding the proposal, the CSSA remains committed to an affordable and accessible CSU for all students, Haley said in a statement.</p><p>One of the proposed options sets slightly different increases for incoming and continuing students. In 2024-2025, new students would experience a 5% increase over what they would have paid the previous academic year, amounting to $288 more. </p><p>Continuing students would face a 3% increase, or $174 for each undergraduate. Another 3% increase would occur each year after that.</p><p>Under a second option, tuition would increase 6% every year for all students. Each undergraduate in 2024-2025 would pay an additional $342. By 2028-2029, full-time undergraduates would pay $7,682 in annual tuition.</p><p>The third option calls for an 8% annual increase for all students. For undergraduates in 2024-2025, that would mean a $462 increase. By 2028-2029, full-time<b> </b>undergraduate students would pay $8,444 a year.&nbsp;</p><p>During the May trustees meeting, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis urged fellow board members to be mindful of burdening students with increased costs.</p><p>Making any kind of decision, particularly on the cost of attendance, has to include a thorough understanding of what it will do to the student body, what it will do to our graduation rates  what it will do for accessibility and opportunity thats provided to our students, she said.</p><p>Since the mid-1990s, the states share of </p>the<p> CSUs operating budget has dropped to 60% from 80%. The state has fully funded CSU's annual budget requests only once in the last decade, at the same time that costs were rising due to inflation.</p><p>The state has taken steps in recent years to help the system: Gov. Gavin Newsom has promised an annual <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-01-10/newsom-gives-california-colleges-and-universities-big-funding-pledge-with-a-catch">5% base funding increase</a> through 2026-2027 in exchange for commitments to expand access and equity.</p><p>But that would not reduce the tuition increases and would still leave a huge funding gap, officials say.</p><p>The proposal to the student association laid out the stakes if the system doesnt find a way to pay for its needs  a persistently underfunded system could mean fewer course offerings, fewer student services and a longer timeline to graduation.</p><p>The system already suffers from a severe backlog of infrastructure needs and has faced intense pressure from labor unions in recent months to raise pay for mechanics, plumbers, electricians and others who keep the buildings running.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Alberto Carvalho on Tuesday outlined a  major shift    to a key educational  intervention    program that will expand its focus beyond helping elementary students who are struggling with reading and math to reaching older students and strengthening the skills of teachers.   most intensively on helping struggling young readers to a plan that also will also reach older students and strengthen the skills of classroom teachers. Carvalho and his senior staff detailed the plan in public for the first time after facing criticism for quietly beginning to dismantle the flagship  instructional initiative of his predecessor, Austin Beutner, earlier this year. That program, known as Primary Promise, had been  publicly lauded by district officials as recently as 14 months ago  as groundbreaking and transformative.  Board member Nick Melvoin said at Tuesday's school board meeting that the public could not be blamed for feeling "whiplash" over a program that was first touted, then criticized. Board member Kelly Gonez said she has seen  the program Primary Promise work effectively at schools and pressed senior officials for specifics on staffing levels under the new academic framework.  Administrators found themselves <b> </b>making the difficult point that they    are   were expanding services but  also cutting costs at the same time.  They noted that the revamped approach,    known as the   Literacy and Numeracy Intervention Model   ,  will reach  as high as middle school    students  instead of stopping at third grade. They ultimately acknowledged that fewer elementary schools would have intervention services but insisted that  the overall services to students of all ages would improve. In answer to a board member's question, Officials set the cost of next year's effort at about $100 million, compared with $134 million this year and about $200 million if Beutner's plan to reach every elementary school    with Primary Promise  had been carried out. The new plan also will rely on training classroom instructors in methods the    intervention  specialists    have   had used. Carvalho said he had to find some way to cut costs to preserve such services  to students. Between now and September 2024, The district has to deal with about 2,100 full-time positions, including those in Primary Promise, that will no longer be funded    by September 2024  because state and federal pandemic relief funds must be spent by that time and won't be renewed. Officials said they can make the transition without layoffs but not without pain.    Employees may   People  will have to shift to new jobs and new schools. The funding problem is real, Carvalho said: "Pulling the rabbit out of the hat will not work. The rabbit is dead, and the hat is small.<p>Primary Promise </p> has <p>relied on specially trained teachers and </p>teacher <p>aides to provide daily </p>ultra-small-group<p> instruction to </p> small groups of <p>students in kindergarten through third grade who </p> were <p>behind in reading, math or both. Their progress was monitored every two to three weeks, with </p>the <p>instruction adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Such efforts  at L.A.

Maria Morgan. Parents offered testimonials in favor of "I have a seventh grader who while in elementary school was part of this amazing program, and without this program, I know for sure he would not be thriving as he is today," she  Maria Morgan said. In an interview, Primary Promise teacher Steve Braudo said the    program's demise represents   demise of the program represented one more instance of the school    district   system lurching in a new direction without  waiting for a thorough evaluation. Officials acknowledged that an evaluation of Primary Promise is not due until the end of July. <p>"The reality is that we can't wait," </p> L.A. Unified  said district <p>Chief Strategy Officer Veronica Arreguin said. "We can't wait for any type of results right now. We need to be able to be ever-changing and supportive as to best practices that we know exist, not only in L.A. Unified but across the nation, that actually have instructional impacts."</p>  She added that And<p> "we've seen that through research" elsewhere.</p> Carvalho's message on Primary Promise  to the extent that he has talked about it at all  has varied, but it's clear he was never won over by the program.  Over the last 10 months, to the extent that Carvalho has talked about Primary Promise at all, the message has varied somewhat, but it's clear he was never won over.  In an August interview, he said there was nothing original about Primary Promise, although such intervention strategies    are   were a sound, if limited, practice. In a May 9 memo to the school board, he challenged the effectiveness of the effort: There is limited data supporting that the current approach has achieved the results as envisioned. In an address Friday, he said there was nothing remarkable about  any progress that occurs red through    such efforts.   the   such an effort.<p>"I can assign any one of you four kids  even if you have no formal training in [teaching] reading  and if you spend 40 minutes with four kids  with no training in [teaching] reading  at the end of three months, those kids will read better," Carvalho said. </p> Education research has documented that "anything you do with kids will provide some degree of improvement," he added. On Tuesday, he  somewhat modified his emphasis.  "Of course it works," he said. "And I'm here to tell you it works because it has worked across the country over the past four decades." Where he has been consistent is    in  asserting that the district could not afford to sustain Primary Promise. Intervention efforts will require new funding sources, Carvalho said, which are available , even if    but  limited.    Under his plan, s ignificantly fewer elementary schools will have intervention services, but such help will be expanded to reach middle schools, and the district is working with schools to use discretionary funds to purchase intervention. Officials  also asserted that the district has to transition out of intervention as a fundamental strategy. In an interview, Carvalho likened it to a hospital relying on an inefficient emergency room for public health. The district instead will focus on more effective teaching by classroom instructors. There will still be intervention services for the schools most in need, he    noted.  said. Critics were not mollified. High school teacher and parent activist    Nicolle Fefferman   said the cuts should have come from programs that aren't  nearly as effective.  or  timely. "The point of Primary Promise is to eliminate the need for later intervention," she said.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Critics target the groundbreaking <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayexpandedbranch.xhtml?tocCode=WIC&amp;division=5.&amp;title=&amp;part=1.&amp;chapter=&amp;article=" target="_blank">Lanterman-Petris-Short Act</a> of 1967 for supposedly filling the streets with drug users and mentally ill people. But LPS, as it is known, didnt do any of that. It and similar laws adopted in other states simply limited the vast power of government to take people into custody and force them into mental health treatment. </p><p>LPS was supposed to be part of a larger restructuring of support under which mental asylums were to be replaced by multiple levels of service: acute care for people in crisis, intermediate "step-down" care for people in recovery to transition out of hospitalization, community clinics for ongoing outpatient care. But these necessary companions to LPS never materialized. </p><p>As society learned more about the nature of psychiatric conditions, and as people living with mental illness began to organize and advocate for themselves more effectively, other types of care were proposed, such as peer communities or villages organized around the particular needs of people dealing with mental illness. </p><p>Government did in fact invest in this reimagined version of care for people with developmental disabilities that originate at birth or in childhood. In combination with the states </p>Department of Disability, department of disability services,<p> a network of regional centers provides services that allow people to live their fullest, most independent lives to the extent their conditions permit. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-25/disabled-children-unserved-racial-disparities-california-regional-centers-report-finds">system has its flaws</a>, but it is a model for providing  simultaneously  care, dignity and self-determination.</p><p>Californians in need of emergency and ongoing psychiatric care also ought to have access to similar services to enable them to likewise live fully, with guidance where needed, and without compulsion or criminal-like loss of liberty where they are not needed.</p><p>Some level of involuntary care will always be appropriate for some Californians, but the point of LPS is to ensure that people dealing with mental illness are not forced into custody and treated against their will unless absolutely necessary for their safety or that of others.</p><p>Too many people with psychiatric conditions and substance use disorders live on the street and in serious danger, but not because LPS made it too hard for government to take them into custody or because they are afforded too much power over their own lives and bodies. Rather, it's because we've never followed through with sufficient services to see to their needs. </p><p>Thats the problem with <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-09/sb-43-gravely-disabled-mental-illness-bill">Senate Bill 43</a> by Sen. Susan Talamantes Eggman, a Stockton Democrat, which would force more people into involuntary treatment in the hope that time-limited care will somehow address their ongoing needs.</p><p>Theres <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-05-01/mental-health-california-us-homelessness-psychiatric-detentions">little if any evidence that such an approach works</a>  if by works we mean lasting improvement in their condition or the creation of the housing and supportive service they will need once the emergency hold or conservatorships expire</p>s<p>. </p><p>Unfortunately, to Californians frustrated by seeing squalor and misery on their streets, works may mean sweeping mentally ill or drug-using homeless people into custody, even if only temporarily. </p><p>And in fact, permitting the sick to live on the street without care is not an acceptable option. But current policies foolishly made the choice binary.</p><p>Without a system that includes sufficient ongoing care, we leave only two choices for unhoused people with psychiatric needs after they are stabilized: Continue occupying beds that are needed for others in crisis, or return to the streets. </p><p>For those struggling with substance use, especially opioid dependence, the choice is even more stark, because returning to the street after having been weaned off the drug, but without ongoing counseling and support, often means death by overdose. The same dose that they formerly tolerated can become deadly following treatment.</p><p>In 2019, lawmakers asked the state auditor to critique LPS for its supposed shortcomings, but the resulting report found the problem was with <a href="https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2019-119.pdf" target="_blank">inadequate ongoing services</a>, not the law. Its as though Californias care infrastructure for mental health and substance use is a leaky and overcrowded canoe. It wont help to add more passengers who dont want to be there, as SB 43 would do. Were going to need a bigger boat  and a better one. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Over the years Rendon served as speaker, Lam has <a href="https://highschool.latimes.com/west-torrance-high-school/apis-mobilize-youth-program-brings-students-closer-to-community/" target="_blank">founded a nonprofit</a>, taken on several new clients and became the executive director of six total organizations, work that allowed her income to swell and public profile to soar. </p> Capitol Journal: New Assembly speaker Anthony Rendon can focus on solutions instead of term limits<p>Though Lam is not a lobbyist, she is paid by an</p> <p>organization that lobbies the Legislature. The</p> <p>League of California Cities has reported paying Lam's business nearly $600,000 over the last year and a half as it lobbied lawmakers on bills related to housing, homelessness and public safety. </p><p>The arrangement is legal, and Lam said her success has nothing to do with her husband's job. Rendon said his wife's employment has not affected his decisions as speaker or how he votes on legislation. A spokesperson for the League of California Cities said Lam helps support the group's diversity goals and does not lobby on bills. </p><p>The lofty payments to Lam and her proximity to one of the most powerful politicians in California have raised questions about the potential for spouses to profit from their partners' public service and create conflicts of interest in the state Capitol. </p><p>"It's not a terrible thing for her to be employed in that way, presuming that she has that expertise to give that advice," said Ann Ravel, a former member of the Federal Election Commission and former chair of the state watchdog agency, the California Fair Political Practices Commission. </p><p>"But what it comes right down to is a question of ethics, and a question of whether or not it's impairing the ability of the elected official to be impartial and to make decisions that are in the best interest of the state when there is this financial impact on him."</p><p>This is not the first time interests that lobby California politicians have forged financial ties with political spouses, prompting concerns about undue influence. Senate leader Toni Atkins, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta</p> , <p>all Democrats, have faced similar scrutiny, while several lawmakers are married to people who work for organizations that lobby the Legislature or have a financial stake in legislation.</p><p>In Rendon's case, while his voting record shows he was not always aligned with the League of California Cities' positions, Lam earned significant sums from several of</p> <p>the group's caucuses.</p> <p>More broadly, Rendon's financial disclosures show that Lam's income grew as he gained power. </p>A career on the rise<p>In 2016, the first year he served as speaker, Rendon's statement of economic interests showed that his 50% share of Lam's income ranged from $10,001 to $100,000. By 2018, Rendon's share had exceeded $100,000, meaning Lam's business was raking in more than $200,000. It's unclear exactly how much Lam was making, because disclosure forms only require lawmakers to report an income range. </p> Meet the Bontas: Can the spouse of the attorney general oversee his budget?<p>For more than a decade, Lam has contracted with the League of California Cities, or Cal Cities, to provide consulting services as executive director to three of the organization's diversity caucuses. She went to work for the Asian Pacific Islander Caucus in 2013, then took on the Women's Caucus in 2017 and the LGBTQ Caucus four years after that, according to Rendon's filings. The caucuses operate as branches of Cal Cities that advocate for issues important to city council members and other elected officials who identify with </p>that population  those populations<p>. </p><p>Cal Cities is a regular fixture in the Capitol because it <a href="https://www.calcities.org/advocacy" target="_blank">lobbies for the interests of hundreds of local governments</a> that want to shape policy concerning housing, homelessness, public safety and labor regulations. While it has scored some significant wins  successfully</p> <p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2053" target="_blank">blocking a bill to create social housing</a> last year and fighting for $1 billion to be allocated in the state budget to alleviate</p> <p>homelessness  Cal Cities doesn't always prevail. In recent years, as the state grapples with a worsening housing affordability crisis, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article254302493.html" target="_blank">lawmakers have pushed back on cities' demands to maintain local control</a>. </p><p>Lam shows up on Cal Cities' <a href="https://fppc.ca.gov/content/dam/fppc/NS-Documents/TAD/Lobbying/Lobbyist-Form-Folder/635_7.1.16.pdf" target="_blank">lobbying disclosures</a>, in a section where the organization must detail any expenses that benefit "in whole or in part" elected officials or their immediate family members.</p><p>Over the last year and a half, Cal Cities paid Lams business $599,932.26</p> , <p>the lobbying reports show. The payments range from <a href="https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/PDFGen/pdfgen.prg?filingid=2674969&amp;amendid=0" target="_blank">$3,000 in a single quarter</a> to <a href="https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/PDFGen/pdfgen.prg?filingid=2643254&amp;amendid=0" target="_blank">more than $188,000</a>, but frequently top $75,000 over a three-month span and compete with how much Cal Cities pays its lobbyists. During the first three months of this year, Cal Cities paid Lam's business <a href="https://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/PDFGen/pdfgen.prg?filingid=2809795&amp;amendid=0" target="_blank">more than $93,000</a> while it paid roughly $110,924 combined to multiple lobbyists. </p><p>Cal Cities did not report how much it paid Lam's business prior to the final quarter of 2021, when it formally recognized the diversity caucuses as "sub-units" of the organization in its bylaws. </p><p>"I have been successful in my two-decade career because I am great at my job," Lam wrote in an email to The Times. "I have worked hard over the past 20 years to develop my expertise. My accomplishments are my own, and my career is my own, which I started prior to marrying my husband. I love my husband, and Im proud of him. But this is my career. I stand on my own abilities, accomplishments, and successes. </p><p>Lam's career in Sacramento began in the early 2000s, when she worked in the offices of Assemblymembers Judy Chu, now in Congress, and Mike Eng, Chu's husband. In launching her consulting business, Lam has worked to <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/article267781092.html" target="_blank">promote Asian and Pacific Islander representation in politics and elevate women and other marginalized groups into power</a>. </p> "Ms. Lams compensation reflected the undeniable value she delivered for the Diversity Caucuses," Lam's attorney, Charles H. Jung wrote in a statement to The Times after the story initially published. "She was responsible for a 4-fold expansion of membership within the API Caucus, a more than doubling of programming for the LGBTQ Caucus, and a greater than 6-fold increase in membership for the Womens Caucus.Rendon's record as speaker<p>When it comes to policy and budget decisions he makes as speaker, Rendon's record supporting Cal Cities is mixed. In some instances, he has</p> <p>split with Cal Cities legislative positions and voted for bills they oppose.</p><p>He helped <a href="https://sd39.senate.ca.gov/news/20220825-legislative-leaders-applaud-agreement-housing-affordability-production-package" target="_blank">shepherd a deal</a> last year on two housing bills that Cal Cities opposed, effectively clearing the path to Newsom's signature. The year before, Rendon <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB9" target="_blank">voted for another controversial housing measure</a> that <a href="https://www.calcities.org/news/post/2021/09/10/more-than-240-california-cities-of-all-sizes-regions-and-demographics-send-governor-newsom-letter-urging-a-veto-of-senate-bill-9" target="_blank">Cal Cities also opposed</a>, which narrowly</p> <p>passed his chamber. He also voted for bills to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2097" target="_blank">eliminate minimum parking requirements</a> in certain neighborhoods close to public transit, which Cal Cities said it "<a href="https://www.calcities.org/news/post/2022/10/05/cities-fare-well-in-final-days-of-the-2022-legislative-cycle" target="_blank">actively fought against</a>," and another measure that <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB897" target="_blank">makes it easier for homeowners to build accessory dwelling units</a>, also known as granny flats or casitas. </p><p>In other instances, Rendon has advanced Cal Cities' goals. As speaker, he has enormous power to shape the state budget.</p> <p>Cal Cities trumpeted its success in a 2022 year-end report, which celebrated securing</p> <p>billions of dollars in the 2022-2023 budget to help local governments mitigate homelessness, comply with recycling regulations, increase the behavioral and mental health workforce, revitalize public libraries, fund environmental and green energy initiatives and increase the affordable housing supply, among other priorities. </p><p>Rendon led the Assembly to approve a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-21/counties-scramble-care-court-preparations">sweeping and controversial new program</a> that Cal Cities supported over objections from civil libertarians and advocates for people with disabilities. The program, called CARE Court, will <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1338" target="_blank">compel Californians struggling with mental illness and addiction into treatment</a>. Rendon also routinely aligns with Cal Cities by supporting many less controversial bills the organization lobbies for. Last year, that included new laws that gave local governments <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1985" target="_blank">more time to comply with composting requirements</a>, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1740" target="_blank">cracked down on catalytic converter theft</a> and added resources for <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB662" target="_blank">first-responder suicide prevention</a>. </p> Bid to allow duplexes on most California lots dies after Assembly approval comes too late<p>"I vote for bills based on the policy itself," Rendon said.</p><p>Annie doesnt lobby, Rendon said, adding that his wifes success has to do with her hard work and her talents and the fact that she has been working in politics since before we met.</p><p>"She's hard-working, she's intelligent, she's experienced. She's worked in this realm before I worked in this realm, he said.</p><p>Ravel said Rendon's voting record indicates some independence, even though he's economically benefiting from Lam's work with the caucuses.</p><p>"I think it does matter that he has done that, and thats a plus," Ravel said of his votes against Cal Cities' positions.</p><p>Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor and political ethics expert, urged caution against assuming that Lams work is inappropriate just because shes the speakers wife.</p><p>I think we should be really careful about saying spouses are engaged in unethical behavior simply because they are working in a related space and doing well financially," Levinson said. "My question would really be, what is market for what shes doing and is she somebody you would hire regardless of who she is married to? If the answer is she is being paid an enormous amount of money and thats fair market and shes qualified to do that, then I dont have big ethical concerns.</p> A new California housing law has done little to encourage building, report says <p>Cal Cities spokesperson Rachel Vincent said Lam's payments were negotiated separately with each caucus within the organization. Vincent did not answer a question about how much Cal Cities pays other consultants who work with the organization's caucuses. </p><p>"The support services provided by Ms. Lams consulting company to the diversity caucuses are not provided for the purpose of helping Cal Cities achieve its policy goals," Vincent said in an email. </p><p>Lam said her work for the three caucuses focuses on "program management, internal organization and governance, membership, and other caucus matters, and that she has one or two staff members' help to handle the workload.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b4/f2/9ec20af04a719a90fbd73e4bf501/assembly-speaker.JPEG"></figure><p>"I do not report to Cal Cities  and to be clear I dont always agree with Cal Cities," she said. I report to the three diversity caucuses.</p>A push for transparency <p>Even as Rendon and Cal Cities have seemingly complied with reporting requirements, experts say more can be done to ensure greater transparency from elected officials. That includes modifying the annual statements of economic interest to require additional details on how much their spouses or they themselves are making on work outside the Capitol, rather than asking them to check a box with a range. That could provide the public greater insight into their personal wealth and financial interests. </p><p>It is really important to have some specificity," Ravel said. "Because just checking off $100,000 or more, it could be millions. So people are really not getting the information that they need to assess whether that amount of money  and the amount of money is significant  has created some kind of a conflict.</p> Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom to place California wineries, hotels in blind trust<p>Those transparency</p> <p>changes could have a ripple effect beyond Rendon and Lam. </p><p>Reports from both The Times and </p> the <p>Sacramento Bee found that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-governor-newsom-business-conflicts-20181220-story.html">companies lobbying Newsom's office</a> also <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article251851903.html">helped fund his wife's nonprofit and salary</a>. Another analysis by The Times found that as Senate President Pro Tem Toni Atkins' clout grew in the Capitol, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-toni-atkins-spouse-housing-contracts-20190404-story.html">her wife's consulting business similarly soared</a>.</p><p>Then-Assemblymember Rob Bonta, now California's attorney general, founded a foundation while he was in the Legislature that gave <a href="https://calmatters.org/projects/california-political-legislative-nonprofits-rob-bonta-wife/">$25,000 to a nonprofit where his wife was earning a six-figure salary as CEO</a>, according to a 2020 CalMatters investigation. And a 2021 Sacramento Bee report found that corporations with business before the Legislature <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/article249343790.html">were donating to nonprofits connected to Lam. </a></p><p>"Money finds a way in politics," said Sean McMorris, a program manager at the good-government group California Common Cause. </p> Ginni Thomas reiterates false election claims to Jan. 6 panel<p>"Both the politician that is in power and the spouse that is potentially operating in the same field or sphere, they're going to be much more scrutinized about why they are doing what they do and why they are making the amount of money that they do. And there's also going to be questions about is that money going to influence potentially, either explicitly or implicitly." </p><p>Rendon's tenure as speaker is slated to come to an end later this month. </p><p>But questions about the financial ties between family members of powerful politicians and interest groups that hold sway at the Capitol are not likely to vanish. </p><p>At the end of June, Rendon is expected to hand the gavel to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-10/california-assembly-elects-democrat-robert-rivas-as-speaker">Assemblymember Robert Rivas (D-Hollister)</a>.

Apart from the occasional plea to an audience, "Please do not reveal the shocking conclusion</p> ,<p>" as in punchline movies like "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-sleuth9sep09-story.html">Sleuth</a>" or "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-08-06/haley-joel-osment-sixth-sense-anniversary">The Sixth Sense</a>," spoilers were until relatively recently not a thing. These days</p> ,<p> some viewers think nothing should ever be revealed about a show or film they haven't gotten around to watching yet  which is to say, ever  though it is easy enough not to read reviews. (Harder to avoid is social media, where </p>lay<p> viewers spoil more plot points than any professional critic has the time to.)</p><p>Networks and streamers and their marketing departments have now come preemptively to ask critics not to reveal certain details of a series in order to "preserve the audience viewing experience," though just which details </p> areis<p> usually left to the writer's discretion. Most reviewers, who are also viewers, understand and are happy to oblige. Specific requests are by and large easy to accommodate  sometimes they are so minor, you wonder what the fuss is.</p><p>Which brings us to "<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-crowded-room/umc.cmc.495pmjg441gg3j70j3x2yufx9" target="_blank">The Crowded Room</a>," premiering Friday on Apple TV+. The official requests, though few, are so broadly stated and so central to the series as to make any meaningful review of the program impossible  indeed, one requested Thing to Avoid is common to nearly every mystery or thriller, if not, indeed, their very definition. Apart from commenting on the production values, performances, pacing, general quality of dialogue and describing the action in the early episodes, there will not be much to say  certainly nothing about the </p>series' <p>actual subject </p> of the series<p>, how it's treated, and whether "The Crowded Room" succeeds in its aims, except in the vaguest terms, and even some vague terms qualify as forbidden.</p><p>(Of course</p> ,<p> there is no law saying that a writer can't refuse to honor these requests, but for the most part</p> ,<p> we go along to get along.)</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/12/75/938ff26f46c4aa7fc15944465d98/the-crowded-room-photo-0101071.jpg"></figure><p>Here is the official description of the series.</p>Starring and executive produced by  Tom Holland, The Crowded Room is a gripping, 10-episode limited series that stars Holland as  Danny Sullivan, a man who is arrested following his involvement in a shooting in New York City in 1979. A captivating thriller told through a series of interviews with curious interrogator  Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried), Dannys life story unfolds, revealing elements of the mysterious past that shaped him, and the twists and turns that will lead him to a life-altering revelation.<p>It's probably safe to mention that the series was created by </p> Akiva Goldsman<p>, and inspired by a "non-fiction novel," with which it has little in common past its greater subject, which I am not supposed to tell you. (That each episode ends with a title card reading "If you or someone you know, needs support, go to apple.com/heretohelp" might say something, if nothing in particular.) As is often the case, the property has been bouncing around Hollywood for a while, changing its shape and name until finding its current</p>, 10-episode, limited-series cutting this since we say it above<p> form. That Goldsman, who wrote the screenplay for "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-feb-13-et-gold13-story.html">A Beautiful Mind</a>," is best known for his work in sci-fi, horror and genre pictures is not irrelevant to the way he has externalized certain psychological elements. (I was also reminded in this respect of the Disney</p> -<p>Pixar film "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-inside-out-pixar-movie-reviews-critics-20150617-story.html">Inside Out</a>.") I wouldn't call it technically, or medically, accurate, but it does make a kind of pictorial sense.</p><p>Anyway, as our story opens, we see Danny, a nervous, bedraggled young man, clutching a paper bag, riding a subway in the company of a woman we will come to know as </p> Ariana (Sasha Lane)<p>. Up from the underground, he passes by Radio City Music Hall, with Frank Sinatra advertised on the marquee  the period work makes an immediate impression, all those extras in vintage clothing, all the old cars on the street  and proceeds to Rockefeller Center, where a gun comes out and goes off multiple times.</p><p>In the very next scene, police arrest Danny </p> atfrom <p>his home (Ariana has "disappeared"), and then we are at the station house, one cop noting that Danny was "just a little good luck shy of a murder charge." (No one was killed.) </p> Det. Matty Dunne (Thomas Sadoski)<p> wonders whether </p> Dannyhe<p> might be a serial killer, and subsequent flashbacks seem to indicate we'll be witnessing TV's </p>nth<p>-hundred "making of a psycho" story. The series quickly brings in </p> Seyfried<p>'s character, Rya, whom Dunne addresses as "professor" and who is invited to ask Danny questions. Their scenes together are quietly compelling; indeed, this story could be told effectively as a duologue  though not over </p> 10 <p>hours, a length that seems arbitrary as regards the drama, but </p> that<p> must have been deemed economically advantageous.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/f8/89/bc7637144390bba788cab6b6a256/the-crowded-room-photo-0101021.jpg"></figure><p>"I wasn't a very popular kid at school," Danny tells Rya; and Holland, </p> though <p>27 and British, does impressively inhabit a luckless American high school student. (He'll age a few years over the course of the show.) Saddled with an immediately unlikable stepfather (</p> Will Chase<p>) and an intimidated mother (</p> Emmy Rossum<p>), Danny relies for support first on two goofball friends, </p> Mike (Sam Vartholomeos)<p>, who is sporty, and </p> Jonny (Levon Hawke)<p>, who does card tricks and knows where to buy pot. Later, moving into what he calls "the ghost house," he will come under the protective wing of bullish landlord </p> Yitzhak (Lior Ra   z  s) <p>and wild child Ariana. (That the police can locate neither after the Rockefeller Center incident is what prompts Det. Dunne to imagine a serial killer.) Even later, in London, of all unlikely places, we'll meet another sort of guardian,</p>  Jack (Jason Isaacs),<p> who has something to do with Danny's biological father.</p><p>Filling out the opening episodes are a girl Danny likes, Annabelle</p> Isabel on IMDB but it's Annabelle; it was doubtless once Isabel, but changed<p> (Emma Laird), a bully who doesn't like him and some frightening local drug dealers with whom the kids get mixed up. Things turn a little violent sometimes. There's also talk of Danny's absent twin, Adam, whose fate remains mysterious up until the moment the series declares something you have already guessed.</p><p>There are time jumps in these early scenes, some obvious, some not, and gaps you will not notice until they are filled in later on, as early scenes are revisited. This is cleverly done, though you would have to watch the series twice to get a full sense of it, because "The Crowded Room" is very long, and you may have forgotten much by the time you reach the end.</p><p>Things have been arranged to keep Danny sympathetic throughout, if a little confounding at times, more victim than victimizer, and the series advances toward a conclusion that will allow Rya to muse lengthily upon overcoming hurt. ("If a relationship can break you, then sometimes a relationship can also heal you," she begins.) The story is sad, but ultimately not a tragedy, which would have felt very much like a waste of time.</p><p>The performances are good; the production values are high</p> ;,<p> the dialogue is well-written. The soundtrack is filled with great songs from the period  the late 70s produced a lot of fantastic music. Some things make enough sense for one of Goldsmans <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/the-big-picture/story/2009-05-15/angels-demons-at-least-tom-hanks-has-better-hair">Dan Brown adaptations</a>, but not really enough for a series that wants to engage in real</p> -<p>world problems and pathologies. The length of the series, which is padded with extraneous material  including a home life for Rya and a backstory for Dannys mother and stepfather  and scenes that run longer than necessary</p> , <p> dilutes its effects, saps the drama of energy. ("The Sixth Sense" took only 108 minutes to get to its big reveal.)</p><p>In the end, the filmmakers  or the promotion</p> al<p> team at Apple  may be overly concerned about maintaining the element of surprise. The series' actual subject matter becomes obvious relatively early anyway, and, really, one could know it from the start without the viewing experience being significantly harmed. There are levels in the misdirection, and not all its secrets are given up at once.</p> The Crowded Room                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before. And then on top of that, being a producer dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set added that extra level of pressure.</p><p>"But I really enjoyed it. I loved the learning curve of becoming a producer. I'm no stranger to hard work. I've always lived by this idea that hard work is good work. ... But then again, the show did break me. There did come a time where I was like, 'I need to have a break.' I disappeared. I went to Mexico for a week and had some time on a beach and laid low. And I'm now taking a year off, and you know, that is a result of how difficult this show was."</p> Tom Holland says TV gig helped him recognize mental health 'triggers' amid sobriety<p>Created by </p> Akiva Goldsman<p>, "The Crowded Room" also stars </p> Amanda Seyfried<p> as an investigator on the central case. The first three episodes of the 10-episode psychological thriller  based on </p> Daniel Keyes<p>' 1981 nonfiction novel "The Minds of </p> Billy Milligan<p>" &nbsp;are set to launch Friday, followed by installments of one episode per week. </p><p>Holland plays </p> Danny Sullivan<p>,</p>  a bullied teenager living with dissociative identity disorder while maintaining his innocence. Danny is a fictional version of Milligan, <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-billy-milligan-20141218-story.html">who was found not guilty</a></p>  of robbing, kidnapping and raping three women near Ohio State University in the late 1970s after psychiatrists determined he had as many as 24 different personalities.<p>"I was really excited by the challenge of bringing him to life, understanding the responsibility of telling a story like this, hearing the message from Akiva, hearing what he wants to try and achieve and feeling really aligned with him," Holland told Extra.</p><p>"It was time to tell a story about mental health ... try and educate some people into how crazy it can be and how your mind is so powerful  and it can work for good, and it can work for bad. And it really resonated with me ... I really, really was terrified by the idea of playing this character. And for me, that's a really good thing."</p> Tom Holland takes break from social media: 'It's very detrimental to my mental state' This isn't the first time Holland has raised awareness <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-08-18/amy-schumer-tom-holland-video-social-media-mental-health">     about mental health  </a></p> . Last summer, the BAFTA winner announced that he had <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-08-15/tom-holland-social-media-mental-health-instagram-video">     "taken a break" from social media  </a></p>  because being online was "very detrimental" to his mental well-being. He also has recently partnered with stem4, a charity that provides mental health resources to teens living with anxiety, depression, eating disorders or addiction. There is an awful stigma against mental health," Holland said in August, "and I know that asking for help and seeking help isnt something that we should be ashamed of, but it is something that is much easier said than done."                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Opry Mills also boasts a mediocre Mexican chain restaurant, per Lewis description, called Chuys, which shes heard inspired the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BamaU09AdGA&amp;ab_channel=PurpleMountains-Topic" target="_blank">Margaritas at the Mall</a> by the Silver Jews <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-08-12/david-berman-appreciation-thomas-beller">David Berman</a>, a poet and songwriting hero of Lewis who died in 2019.</p><p>So in addition to the mall walking and the massages, shell sometimes throw her black cockapoo in her Chevy Colorado  the stars of her own song Puppy and a Truck  and hit Chuys for an afternoon drink on the patio.</p><p>You know, she says, in honor of Berman.</p><p>Finding happiness where perhaps you least expect it  thats one of the secrets of life that Lewis, 47, explores on her enchanting new album, JoyAll, which puts her sweet, sly voice over funky and laid-back country-rock arrangements that split the difference between the musical traditions of her two hometowns. Recorded in Nashville with producer Dave Cobb (known for his work with Chris Stapleton and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-10-11/brandi-carlile-joni-mitchell-grammys-2023">Brandi Carlile</a>), the LP follows a series of personal losses for Lewis, including her mother, who died in 2019; a couple of show-business mentors in film-music editor Jerry Cohen and album-cover designer Gary Burden; and her social life for much of the year 2020, which she spent isolated </p>by herself<p> at her place in the Studio City hills thanks to a history of serious childhood asthma that left her especially vulnerable to COVID.</p><p>Yet JoyAll exults in having survived hardship to inherit the wisdom of middle age. My 40s are kicking my ass / And handing em to me in a margarita glass, she sings against a shuffling groove in Puppy and a Truck; later, the jazzy-soulful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHTG3YbQWg&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">The Essence of Life</a> defines that elusive state as both suffering and ecstasy.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv8aibmIqag&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewis<p>Lewis new album also comes as shes embraced her role as a kind of godmother to a younger generation (or two) of rock artists, many of them women, writing with wit and acuity about the details of their emotional lives.</p><p>Without Jenny Lewis theres no <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-04-07/phoebe-bridgers-coachella">Phoebe Bridgers</a>, theres no Soccer Mommy, theres no <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-04-03/boygenius-the-record-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker-lucy-dacus">Boygenius</a>, says Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, whos been close with Lewis since he recruited her to sing background vocals on Give Up, the 2003 debut by his electro-pop side project, the Postal Service.</p><p>Curled in an armchair at home in Studio City  her little dog, Bobby Rhubarb, tucked next to her  Lewis smiles when asked on a recent afternoon how that hallowed position makes her feel.</p><p>Stoked, she says. And old. The sound of vintage reggae drifts from a cassette boombox in the kitchen; out back by the pool are dozens of small stones Lewis hand-painted during the pandemic to evoke Salvation Mountain near the Salton Sea. Once you realize youre at the age where not only can you write a memoir but you can be a mentor, thats a pretty big moment, says Lewis, whos wearing gold corduroys and a Grand Royal Records sweatshirt, her long red hair beneath a beat-up ball cap. I do consider myself a pioneer. But a lot of these women that have looked up to my music, theyve eclipsed my record sales or my streaming numbers, if you pay attention to that s.</p><p>Indeed, theres something of an underground-legend quality to Lewis, whose many other admirers include Katie Crutchfield of Waxahatchee and the L.A. sister trio Haim, whose Danielle Haim once played guitar in Lewis live band. The singer has been thinking lately about the things that didnt quite happen in her career to bring real-deal pop stardom  like Rilo Kileys buzzy 2004 single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn7Ldn7liGU&amp;ab_channel=RiloKiley-Topic" target="_blank">Portions for Foxes</a> not becoming an actual hit, as she puts it, or the time the band was in the running for a coveted performance on Saturday Night Live in 2007 only to see the show go dark amid that years Hollywood writers strike.</p><p>That mightve changed the course of history for us, she says of the SNL spot. But I actually wouldnt change anything. Not being on SNL kind of led me to this moment where Im in control of my art on every level.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/30/8d/9ec4c5d847fea662bcf1f6901a25/gettyimages-1495842848.jpg"></figure><p>In a funny twist, the serenely satisfied JoyAll  Lewis fifth solo album and her first for the venerable Blue Note label  could be one to expand Lewis audience. On the road in 2021 she played in front of hundreds of thousands of potential new fans as Harry Styles opening act. The demand for a Rilo Kiley reunion seems to grow louder with every year. Even Lana Del Rey wrote a song about her, or so Lewis is pretty sure: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN0OmdJUl0I&amp;ab_channel=LanaDelReyVEVO" target="_blank">Blue Banisters</a>, Im assuming Im the Jenny that jumped into a pool, she says of a line from the title track of Del Reys 2021 LP.</p><p>A friend of mine was staying in the back house, Lewis explains, nodding through a set of glass doors, and Lana came to visit. We were hanging out and swimming, and throughout our conversation, she was sort of speaking into her voice notes [on her phone]. Later, she texted me  like, Hey, do you mind if I use this in a song? Our conversation had made its way into her song, which is very beautiful. (Among Lewis other high-profile pals is Jimmy Buffett, with whose family shes vacationed. The Buffetts really know how to do it, she says. Even if youre not a beach-y person, they make you get in the water every day.)</p><p>Don Was, the Grammy-winning producer and Blue Note president, says Lewis is pretty blas about pop stardom. Shes not doing stupid s like chasing Justin Bieber." But, he adds, Jennys a very savvy person. She wants to reach people with her music.</p><p>Says Gibbard: Ive always gotten the sense that a spirit of anti-fame fame is appealing to her.</p><p>Lewis was born in Las Vegas, where her parents performed in casinos as a lounge act; her mom and dad split when she was 3, and her mom took her and her older sister to Van Nuys. Lewis spent the 80s working on sets: a Jell-O commercial, a gig on Growing Pains, a role playing Shelley Longs daughter in Troop Beverly Hills. Her memories of those days are shaped by her complicated relationship with her mother, who was addicted to heroin and used Lewis earnings to buy drugs.</p><p>This is sort of embarrassing, but I wet the bed until I was 8 or 9, Lewis says. She remembers driving to an audition in her mothers copper-colored Honda Accord when she accidentally peed in the front seat. My mom was so mad at me. But I booked the job.</p><p>Lewis quit acting in her early 20s and formed Rilo Kiley with Blake Sennett, a fellow child actor.</p>;t<p>The band, which flexed an encyclopedic knowledge of rock history in tunes about ambition, sex and depression, spent a decade creeping right up to the big time before drifting apart around 2011. By the time she was 40, Lewis had solidly established herself as a solo act adored by in-the-know millennials and classic rockers alike.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/89/02/8264a7d749c9b80cbedabfa3b722/gettyimages-86104556.jpg"></figure><p>Yet shed also broken up with her longtime boyfriend, singer-songwriter Johnathan Rice, and decided it was time to get out of the Valley. So she went to New York, where she lived for two years in her friend Annie Clarks East Village apartment while Clark, who performs as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-08-26/st-vincent-audible-podcast-audiobook-words-and-music">St. Vincent</a>, lived in L.A. We Freaky Friday-ed, Lewis says. She and a couple of friends formed a scrappy, politically minded post-punk trio, Nice </p>A<p>as F, that played shows until late 2016, when one of the members was eight months pregnant. And then Trump got elected and the mood just shifted, says Lewis, who recalls election night in Clarks fifth-floor walk-up. You could hear the screams of the people in the building.</p><p>At the time, Lewis was dating someone who lived in Nashville and decided to give the town a try. Im not immersed in the music business there at all, she says. I can do a little cowgirl cosplay, which is fun. But ultimately Im not cut from that cloth. And according to the allergy test I took yesterday, Im allergic to horses.</p><p>Even so, shes enjoying educating herself on the history of country music. Shes been covering Keith Whitleys <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka_lJGRGPs8&amp;ab_channel=KeithWhitleyVEVO" target="_blank">Miami, My Amy</a> in concert; often shell drive out to the cemetery in suburban Hendersonville where Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash are buried. Theres also this guy Merle Kilgore, who wrote Ring of Fire,  she says. His headstone is so flashy  like, its totally upstaging Johnny and June. Its so Nashville, I love it.</p><p>Some of the songs on JoyAll came out of a virtual songwriting camp the musician Beck convened in early 2021 in which hed give the participants various prompts, such as Write a song using only clichs. (Lewis response to that one was the twanging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjklFFGL_Hc&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">Love Feel</a>, with its talk of fire and lightning and sugar in the gas tank.)</p><p>Lewis met </p> the producer <p>Cobb through her friends in the L.A. duo <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-04-11/lucius-brandi-carlile-harry-styles">Lucius</a>, who were in Nashville making their album Second Nature with Carlile. Lewis identifies the 60s country-pop star Skeeter Davis as a crucial influence on her new album, though its easy to hear Lindsey Buckingham in Psychos and Tom Petty in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAbvq5uwnDk&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">Apples and Oranges</a>.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlNVtA6Lgu4&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO<p>The LPs sound is considerably leaner than Lewis last few albums, which she attributes in part to the fact that she was trying to be COVID-cautious about how many people were in the studio at a given time. Says Cobb: I just love her voice so much that I wanted to make that the thing. To the producers ears, Lewis</p>s<p> singing has this ability to soothe even when shes writing about some really deep stuff, he adds. I hear real happiness in her voice on this record.</p><p>For her previous album, 2019s On the Line, Lewis hired Ryan Adams to produce  a decision she grew to regret when, just weeks before the record dropped, Adams was accused by several women of sexual misconduct. </p> (At the time, Adams denied the claims against him.) <p>Lewis said then that Adams didnt abuse her, though today shes still haunted by something he told her in the studio, which was, Enough of this campfire bulls,  she recalls. But this record is a return to that campfire bulls, because I want to be able to take my guitar and play these songs anywhere by myself.</p><p>A sense of self-sufficiency is important to Lewis in both her music and her life. In addition to Clark, she let other friends stay in her Studio City place while she was away, including a family with a newborn, which she thinks cleansed the house of whatever energy remained from her years there with Rice. Then I had to come back and go through s, she says. Its way sparser now. I got rid of all the pictures on the walls  they were all of Johnathan. She looks around the living room, which is virtually empty beyond a chair, a sofa and a marimba sitting in the corner. This is my space, and I love it. But Im really happy that I have the luxury of going back and forth between here and a new place  making new memories somewhere else, having new romantic experiences in a different bed.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e6/dc/572886534f5e8e82bab576543966/1295033-et-jenny-lewis-mrt-03.jpg"></figure><p>Lewis will spend much of this year on the road, playing festivals, headlining her own shows and opening arena dates for Beck and Phoenix (including an Aug. 7 stop at the Kia Forum) before joining Gibbard for a tour marking the 20th anniversary of the Postal Service album. (That tour will wrap in October with three nights at the Hollywood Bowl.)</p><p>For her current live band, which includes only women, I want to create an environment thats safe, fun, not too serious  but serious in the work, she says. I want to rehearse, and I want to get it right. Learning how to have these talks before you embark on a journey  like, Here are the ground rules  I think thats really positive.</p><p>Did the experience with Adams make her feel responsible for more closely vetting the people she works with? Yes, she replies. Im in charge of 12 people on tour  theyre my responsibility. Whatever behavior was going on in 2004 does not fly now. I mean, it didnt fly back then, and I was uncomfortable with a lot of stuff. Hooking up with random fans in the bunks? That sucks. I hate that.</p> With a sexy beat, Rilo Kiley tests the indie limits<p>Lewis doesnt want to get into the specifics of who was doing what in 2004. But its clear shes talking about some of the personality conflicts that eventually drove apart Rilo Kiley. And yet these days she seems more open to that longed-for reunion than she ever has.</p><p>Playing those songs together would be really fun, she says. Giving people the satisfaction of hearing songs that were a part of their formative high school experiences  thats a very special thing to provide. Its certainly something thats in our consciousness, and I think if the time is right in our relationships, then the music will be easy.</p><p>So: Coachella 2025?</p><p>I feel like thats, she says, trailing off with a laugh. I dont think 2024. For now shes willing to keep disappointing people by withholding what they want. Theyre always like, We miss how you were then!  she says.</p><p>One wonders if encountering that attitude makes her want to dig in her heels regarding Rilo Kiley.</p><p>Of course, Lewis says. Were never</p>,<p> ever</p>,<p> ever getting back together, to quote Taylor Swift. But thats not true. Im not a person who closes the door.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Once, the Connecticut native thought he might become a pro baseball player before the acting bug bit and he fell in love with film.

"He had to be someone who had a certain youthful innocence but also wasn't a pushover.

"He doesn't have a ton of dialogue so it has to be conveyed in his eyes, and Chris was able to do that over a Zoom audition, no easy feat. And, at its heart, 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' is a love story, so finding leads with chemistry was one of my biggest priorities. Chris and Lola have an undeniable chemistry on screen. When I saw Chris with Lola, I knew he was the right Conrad."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ce/bf/af21092a43a484bb79420535ba98/1300743-et-christopher-briney-daliland-10.jpg"></figure><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3f/b5/4a2a518041c4809de05ece866bd5/1300743-et-christopher-briney-daliland-12.jpg"></figure><p>Being catapulted into the public eye at such a meteoric speed  and garnering <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisbriney_/" target="_blank">1.8 million followers on Instagram</a>, where </p> Briney<p> promotes his work alongside more intimate glimpses of his life and inner circle  is an ongoing adjustment. "Being a face on someone's screen is something that I'm still getting used to," </p> the actor <p>admits. </p><p>Maybe that's why he finds kinship in his first major roles. Both James, an aspiring curator eager to be among artists</p>  in "Dal    land,"<p> and Conrad, a teenager struggling with his own buried anxieties </p> on "Summer," <p>are watchful by nature, </p> like him.  "B<p>eing an observer is something that I really enjoy as a human  being an observer, a consumer of art</p> ," he offers.<p> "To be the filter through which people get to see Sir Ben and Dal</p> <p> and his world and Mary's movie was the most exciting thing for me, to attempt to be the way into the story."</p><p>He still vividly recalls the moment he met Kingsley on set, where his nerves helped him tap into the character.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/81/72/7a77e3824418888ac1834147c6c5/daliland-1.jpg"></figure><p>"He came up to me and was like, 'They're really throwing you into the deep end on this one,'" says Briney. "He put his fist to my chest and said, 'Good luck,' and then he walked away. And for most of the rest of it</p> ,<p> I knew him in character as Dal</p> <p>. The next time I saw him was our first table read. We had a little screen test and they had us in costume and makeup. He started saying lines from a scene that I hadn't really worked on yet, just exercising the character. And in the moment I was like, 'Oh man  am I going to not know my lines?'"</p><p>It was a steep learning curve, he says. "I remember all the really rough days where I was dealing with anxiety and insecurity," he says of his first two days filming a long Steadicam shot on a beach in Wales standing in for Spain. "I felt like I was learning how to ride a bike with no wheels.</p>  M<p>y memory of it is feeling</p>  like I was going to either die or get fired before I f finish this movie."<p>A day later, things just clicked. "I had this scene in a car </p>  <p>simply pretending to drive a car </p>  <p>and everything just felt possible again. I was like, 'I can do this.'"</p><p>Serving as "Dal</p> <p>land</p> 's<p>"</p>'s<p> audience surrogate was a major task, and one Harron admits was a risky bet to place on a new actor. But in </p> Briney'sthe actor's steady <p>gaze</p> ,<p> Harron found oceans of depth and a rare luminosity. "A lot of it is him watching, taking us into these different worlds. You want someone with really good eyes, that are expressive and almost reflective." I said to ["Dal</p> <p>land" writer and </p> Harron's <p>husband] John [C. Walsh], 'It's like he has a </p>R r<p>ing light in his eyes'  they light up.

He was also keenly aware of his parents' acting endeavors and the odds against finding success in the industry. "I always knew that they had tried to act, and that they loved it but I wanted to do something different</p> . <p> I wanted to be a little bit of a rebel," he says with a smile.

"I don't think I'm much of a tell-jokes kind of a guy," he says. "It was a new muscle to explore, but I had a great time doing it."</p>&nbsp;<p>When "Summer" returns for its second season next month with a storyline that expands on the second book in Han's bestselling trilogy, audiences will see Briney unlock new dimensions in his Conrad character. "He's walking through life with a new lens and being affected by factors that didn't exist in the first season," he teases.</p><p>To Han, it's the emotions Briney can convey with just a glance that bring the beloved character so fully to life. "As an actor, Chris conveys so much longing and intensity in just a look or a gesture," she said. I'm continually impressed by how he captures Conrad's seriousness and is so judicious about lighthearted moments from Conrad, because when he grants the audience a rare smile, it's like the sun peeking through the clouds," she wrote.</p><p>With his first feature finally out in the world, Briney is feeling grateful for the opportunities that have opened up in the last two life-changing years. "When we were making this show I was like, 'I just hope one person watches and is really affected by it,'" he says. "That's really all that matters to me.

One was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-05-29/succession-finale-tom-shiv-marriage">populated exclusively by horrible people</a>, the other almost entirely by good ones. Both raised the question of whether change is possible; <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-05-28/succession-finale-live-updates">the first seemed to say no</a>, the second explicitly, emphatically declared yes. I had little interest in the former</p>,<p> and remained a fan of the latter through its life, which may say more about me than either of the shows in question, and so be it.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-09-01/ted-lasso-apple-tv-cast-episodes-guide">Ted Lasso</a>," which </p> appears to have <p>concluded its three-season run on Apple TV+ on Wednesday,</p> there is some ambiguity about it, so couched.<p> is that second show, which went out with tears, hugs and a chorus of </p>"Auf Wiedersehen" "So Long, Farewell" <p>from "The Sound of Music." There were no big surprises. Anyone paying attention, and sensitive to the show's heart, would know that Ted (</p> Jason Sudeikis<p>) would go back to his son and America at the end; that Nate (</p> Nick Mohammed<p>), who had defected briefly to the dark side, would make his way back to the light; and that the Richmond Greyhounds would not lose their final match. If you remembered the "</p> Sunflowers<p>" episode, </p> wherein which the team visits Amsterdam,<p> you might have predicted that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-06-01/ted-lasso-hannah-waddingham-rebecca">Rebecca</a> (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-06-01/ted-lasso-hannah-waddingham-rebecca">Hannah Waddingham</a>) would meet her one-night stand again, fulfilling a psychic's prophecy, and the show's duty to the character  because it was the sort of show that would not let her, or any of its characters, down.</p><p>This didn't strike me as a failing. Unpredictability isn't always to the good, especially when you're wrapping up a series in which fans are emotionally invested. It was sentimental as heck, and possibly unrealistic, and at times extremely obvious  all text, no subtext. You don't have to look far to find viewers proclaiming the demerits of the current season  people who, by definition, have cared enough about the show to be disappointed</p>,<p> and who give considered reasons why this season was not as good as the last (which also happened in the second season). Writers I respect have come down hard on it. And you can't argue with another person's experience. But I loved it.</p><p>The series presented the story of an American college football coach</p>,<p> who knows nothing about soccer  that is, football, as defined everywhere but here  and is hired to manage a low-ranked English team</p>,<p> in order (though he doesn't know this) to sink it. (Quite the opposite happens, obviously.) That's the premise. But what "Ted Lasso" was "about" is something else. For one thing, title aside, it wasn't about Ted Lasso, in the end just one character of a connected many. (He corrects journalist </p> Trent Crimm<p>, played by </p> James Lance<p>, who has titled his book on the team's season "The Lasso Way": "It's not about me  it never was.")</p><p>What the show was about is becoming a better person, the radical nature of kindness, and the importance of family, in whatever shape it comes  a football team, </p> itstheir <p>fans, the ad hoc men's group the Diamond Dogs, and actual relations. (We got the late-season treat of </p> Becky Ann Baker<p> as Ted's visiting mother.) In a last-episode complication, Rebecca considers selling the club; finally, she sells 49</p> %percent<p> of it to the fans, enlarging the family. "Heaven is other people" might be its animating idea.</p><p>"Ted Lasso" was long on talk and interested in the sort of delicate feelings not always associated with sports stories and, perhaps, never aired in an actual locker room. It didn't shy from wearing its heart on its sleeve</p>,<p> and pointing it out with the other hand. But obviousness, if not the most sophisticated approach to storytelling, is appreciated when it amplifies one's own feelings.</p><p>Realism wasn't the point; certainly it was an inexact portrayal of the workings of a football team, off and on the pitch. No actual person spins elaborate, obscure pop-cultural puns and similes off the top of their head like Ted did ("I'm like Michael Flatley at 11:59 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day  I'm tapped out"), perhaps a little too often. Things happened in Richmond's final game that made no sense strategically, only emotionally. No problem. Emotions are what we came for. Winning is just a bonus.</p><p>The show was a kind of fairy tale, and fairy tales reward the good and punish the bad. As far as villains, apart from Sam Richardson's brief return as spiteful Ghanaian billionaire Edwin Akufo, there was only Anthony Head's narcissistic Rupert, Rebecca's ex</p>-<p> and owner of a rival team; significantly, his comeuppance came not at the hands of any other character  that would have required an ordinarily kind person to be cruel  but </p> bywas<p> his own doing. Everyone we care about in the show grows up a little, gets out of their own way, repairs a relationship, or just learns to be happier in their skin.</p><p>There are some who rate series not only from season to season but episode to episode, as a sports fan might blow hot and cold on a team from play to play. It's as legitimate a way to watch television as any other, if you have that kind of energy. But it isn't the way I watch, just as I don't judge a book from chapter to chapter. That isn't to say a show can't go off the rails or run out of ideas, but as a viewer  and as a critic, if a full season is provided for review  I tend to wait until all comes to a conclusion to  come to a conclusion. And "Ted Lasso" didn't disappoint me in the end.</p> Ted Lasso infobox                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But the Bruins lost 19 games during that stretch. Oklahoma has dropped just eight during its three-peat.</p><p>Bahl, a sophomore from Papillion, Neb., pitched 24 2/3 scoreless innings in the WCWS and was named its most outstanding player. She went 4-0, earned the save on Thursday and became the first pitcher since 1992 to work at least 20 innings at the World Series without </p> yieldingallowing<p> a run.</p><p>Cydney Sanders and Grace Lyons hit back-to-back homers off Seminoles ace Kathryn Sandercock in the fifth inning. Florida State had taken a 1-0 lead in the fourth on Mack Leonard's homer off Sooners starter Alex Storako.</p><p>Alynah Torres padded the Sooners lead with an RBI single in the sixth, and that was plenty of cushion for Bahl, who struck out three and threw 39 pitches, 28 for strikes.</p><p>Sandercock pitched a complete game for Florida State (58-11), which made its third finals appearance in the last five World Series. The Seminoles won the title in 2018 and were runners-up to Oklahoma in 2021.</p><p>Storako (18-0) worked the first four innings for the Sooners, </p> giving upallowing<p> three hits and getting a sparkling defensive play in the third from center fielder Jayda Coleman, who made a leaping catch at the wall to take away a potential three-run homer from Florida State's Kalei Harding.</p><p>In the top of the third, the Sooners got a bunt single from Rylie Boone  executed so perfectly that the ball stopped on the chalk  to load the bases with no outs. But Sandercock retired the Sooners' top three batters to keep the game scoreless.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8bHpcpAIhY                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Vargas was one of the Dodgers</p> '<p> hotter hitters for much of May.</p> Catholic League launches radio ad campaign urging boycott of Dodgers' Pride Night<p>Yet, theyve each suffered extended slumps: Vargas early in the year while tinkering with his swing; Outman of late while adjusting to a steady diet of high fastballs.</p><p>Theyve each been culpable for defensive mistakes: Outman </p>sometimes <p>struggling to read </p> some<p> fly balls in center; Vargas occasionally getting crossed up fielding grounders to his left.</p><p>And theyve each needed time to get settled into the majors, trying to learn from bumps in a road the team still believes will result in them being key contributors by the end of the season.</p><p>I think theyll both get to the [level of] consistency that big </p>-<p>league ballplayers get to, at some point, manager Dave Roberts said. We need it some time this season. [Well be] counting on them down the road. But theyve got a great support group with their coaches and their teammates. To me, thats really encouraging.</p><p>Outman has encountered wilder </p>rookie <p>swings over the seasons first couple </p> of <p>months.</p><p>In March and April, he looked like a </p>super<p>star in the making. Two hits on opening day. Seven home runs in his first 29 games. Reliable defense </p> atin<p> all three outfield spots. And a few particularly memorable moments</p>memories<p>  most notably, a game-winning, ninth-inning grand slam at Wrigley Field.</p><p>[Thats when] I felt like I was a big leaguer, Outman said of that Chicago series.</p><p>Since then, </p>however, <p>opponents have started treating him like more of a legitimate big league threat</p>,<p> too.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/02/91/08cbd9ac434fb43351242c5f7640/dodgers-padres-baseball-64045.jpg"></figure><p>Teams have started attacking the 26-year-old with high heat, crowding him with up-and-in fastballs after he demonstrated his ability to lay off low spin and wait for mistakes over the plate.</p><p>In the minors, Outman had success against elevated velocity. But against major league arms, the results havent been the same.</p><p>Since the start of May, he is batting </p>just <p>.161 with two home runs and strikeouts in almost 38% of his at-bats.</p><p>His defense has also slipped, with misreads in center becoming concerningly more common.</p><p>Everything is magnified [in the majors], said Outman, whose .773 on-base-plus-slugging percentage still ranks slightly above league average. But I just keep reminding myself, its still the same game. Just got to try to keep a level head.</p><p>Roberts noted the rookie has looked a little too in between at the plate, unable to fight off fastballs at the top of the zone, but also more liable to chase secondary stuff down below</p>,<p> as well.</p><p>The last few weeks, [that] has been more prominent than we've seen, Roberts said. So I think the message, from the hitting coaches to James himself, is have a plan and have conviction. When you get caught in between, things are starting to speed up a little bit.</p><p>Yet, in a dugout interview this weekend, Outmans confidence hardly seemed shaken. He propped his feet up on a railing. He talked about what a blast its </p> been<p> being part of a first-place team.</p><p>He even chuckled about a recent autograph signing he held in Sherman Oaks which, despite his current slump, was still attended by so many fans he had time for only 30-second greetings with each.</p><p>I felt bad for them, honestly, because they waited in line for so long, Outman said, reflecting on his latest reminder of how different MLB stardom can be. But, I feel fortunate people are willing to do that.</p><p>Vargas season has followed an opposite trajectory.</p><p>Early on, the 23-year-old infielder struggled with his swing, batting </p>just <p>.202 (albeit with 21 walks) over his first 28 games.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/cc/2b/791d69ac4998bb9317f21f8df475/dodgers-rays-baseball-73284.jpg"></figure><p>Since then, </p>however, <p>the second baseman has tapped back into the confidence that originally lifted him to the major leagues  and was on full display in his debut last year, when he doubled and stole third in his </p>very <p>first at-bat  with the help of some swing changes following an early-season finger injury.</p><p>Beginning with a four-hit, three-double outburst </p>on <p>May 2 against Philadelphia, Vargas is batting .247 in his last 27 games. Of his 24 hits in that span, 14 have been for extra-bases.</p><p>I feel pretty good, he said recently, after delivering one of his 13 doubles this season in a game at Atlanta. Trying to be more consistent at the plate.</p><p>While there was little doubt his swing would eventually come around  Vargas .745 OPS has him back at league average  his strides on defense have been even more telling about his development in the majors.</p><p>Playing second base for the first time in his pro career, Vargas doesnt grade out as a great defender (among 45 qualified MLB second baseman, he is 35th in outs above average). But he hasnt been as big of a liability as some feared, either.</p><p>He has gotten more comfortable on routine grounders. He has displayed a big arm and cool knack for turning double plays. Most of all, he has applied the lessons Ebel and others have preached to him during his daily </p>regiment of <p>pregame drills.</p> Dodgers Dugout: Are the Diamondbacks for real?<p>Hardest worker on the team, Ebel said. He gets it. Hes absorbing it  And slowly, every day, we got to find a way to get better.</p><p>Lately, it has led to a ritual between Ebel and Vargas before the start of their work each day.</p><p>The coach will ask the rookie, Whats your goal?</p><p>Without hesitation, Vargas will respond: Be the best defender on the team  but dont tell anybody.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Relievers Ben Joyce, Aaron Loup and Sam Bachman combined to keep the Cubs scoreless over the last four innings.</p>For Joyce, it was his first career win.<p>Rengifo has been seeing better results, which he attributed to a positive mindset and being aggressive.

This movie puts a Latino  Richard Montaez, played by Jesse Garcia  front and center. While this may not seem like a radical act, only 4% of the 1,600 most popular movies from 2007 to 2022 featured a Latino in the lead.</p><p>"Flamin Hot" does more than just defy the odds on screen. Behind the scenes, this film about snack foods shatters other conventions. Among the 1,600 top-grossing films from the last 16 years, only one out of every 320 had a Latina director. Only one was directed by a Mexican</p>-<p> American woman. In other words, youre more likely to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds">know a person hit by lightning</a> or to be <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/leap-year-psychological-effects-375317">born on Feb. 29</a> than to see a top-grossing film with someone like Eva Longoria  yes, the actor-producer-director Eva Longoria  at the helm.</p><p>It isnt just the director either. </p> A mere 3% percent of all casting directors in top-grossing films are Latinos.  and fewer than 10 Latinas have received credit as screenwriters of top-grossing movies.<p> From the top of the call sheet to the last credit to roll, the composition of the cast and crew on "Flamin Hot" is an anomaly.</p><p>The Latino community has a rich history and strong cultural impact in this country, but you wouldn't know it by watching movies. "Flamin Hot" takes direct aim at the lack of Latinos in film and the persistent stereotyping they face. It puts businessman Montaez at the center of the story and surrounds him with Latino family and friends. Given <a href="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-hispanic-latino-rep-2021-09-13.pdf">that our research shows that 50% of Latino main characters are isolated on screen</a>, the film provides an important lens on Latino family and community life. The movie also showcases key aspects of Latino culture  food, faith, clothing, relationships  that are often absent from popular movies.</p><p>Hollywood is often quick to tell stories of the Latino as an outsider, someone who wasn't born in this country and doesnt have a say in shaping American values. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/23/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/">Although the majority of the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population is born in the U.S.</a>, only about <a href="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-hispanic-latino-rep-2021-09-13.pdf">one-third of the Hispanic/Latino characters we examined in 2019</a> were Latinos born in the U.S. "Flamin Hot" has no time for such myths: The Latinos at the core of this story are fully American and fully Mexican, and as the characters demonstrate, this means they have </p> an advantage  superpower &lt;&lt;another word?<p> that often goes overlooked.</p><p>Just as "Flamin Hot" Cheetos revealed that the Latino market is a powerful force to drive consumer behavior  even outside the community  so too can "Flamin Hot" serve as a call to action for Hollywood. First, we need more Latino stories brought to the screen. These stories exist and are waiting to be told. Similarly, the talent is there; the people who brought "Flamin Hot" to the screen represent a much larger community of talented Latinos who are ready to be hired for stories that should feature Latinos.</p><p>The rest of the industry has a role to play as well. Talent agencies must recruit and sign more talent and push for their clients to appear in more stories. Casting directors should commit to casting processes that ensure Latino actors are auditioned and cast in greater numbers. Film festivals, nonprofits and philanthropists can designate funding and create initiatives to support and accelerate the work of Latino filmmakers.</p><p>Corporations  even those outside of the entertainment industry  can ensure that their marketing and promotional efforts support Latinos. For example, McDonalds created the <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/spotlight-dorado.html">Spotlight Dorado program</a> to provide funding for Latino filmmakers and mentorship opportunities. As "Flamin Hot" so clearly demonstrates, corporations ignore Latinos</p>  to their own detriment.at their own peril.<p>The Latino market for snacks was all but ignored until decision-makers were reminded about the power of this consumer group. The irony that a movie should make this point is not lost on us. Despite the <a href="https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MPA-2021-THEME-Report-FINAL.pdf">reliability of Latino audiences</a> <a href="https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MPA-THEME-2019.pdf">to show up at the multiplex</a>, Latinos are rarely (if ever) the focus of or the creative force behind top films. This must change.</p><p>The entertainment industry should learn from this movie and continue to serve the Latino community with stories that authentically represent this audience, told by storytellers who identify as Latino. As this new film shows us, theres no limit to the number of products that can be made Flamin Hot  and there should be no limit on the number of Latino stories, either.</p><p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/personnel/ariana-case">Ariana Case</a></p>&nbsp;is the program manager and&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/personnel/katherine-pieper">Katherine Pieper</a></p>&nbsp;is the program director of the USC&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/research/aii">Annenberg Inclusion Initiative</a></p>, founded by&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/stacy-l-smith">Stacy L.

      <title>Will conservative Catholics decry Florida's Sacramento migrant dump?</title>
      <link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-07/migrant-flights-ron-desantis-catholic-church</link>
      <description>Tellingly, the three main architects of Florida’s migrant-shipping strategy have ties to the Catholic Church, including Gov. DeSantis. Meanwhile, Catholics who actually read the Bible have stepped up to help the migrants stranded in Sacramento.</description>

Conservative Catholic activists are marking off the days like a homophobic Advent calendar.</p><p>Theyre the ones who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/story/2023-05-19/dodgers-disgrace-history-by-removing-sisters-pride-night">originally pressured the Blue Crew to rescind the honor</a> from the Sisters, </p> a charity group male drag troupe <p>whose members dress in ornate habits to ridicule religious zealotry, yet who also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2023-05-25/the-sisters-of-perpetual-indulgence-are-on-a-mission-to-spread-universal-joy-despite-the-dodgers-drama">do the good work that nuns do</a>. The Dodgers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-22/dodgers-apologize-invite-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-pride-night">re-invited the Sisters after a public outcry</a>, causing the conservatives to call for a protest of Pride Night and a boycott of the Dodgers. </p>Made change b/c I just learned that not all the Sisters identify as male and they are a charity group that dresses in drag as nuns and not a troupe./ AJ<p>The boycott will be about as successful as the San Diego Padres this season. But that hasnt stopped bishops from California to Texas, Wisconsin to Nebraska from lining up to take their swings at the team and the Sisters. Typical of this Boo Crew is Robert Barron, bishop of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester in Minnesota, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bishops-ordained-20150908-story.html">a former auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles</a> and founder of Word on Fire, a multi</p>-<p>million</p> -<p>dollar ministry that has made him <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-barron-christmas-power-20171225-story.html">one of the most prominent Catholic voices in the country</a>.</p><p>On a Twitter video posted May 25, he slammed the Sisters as an anti-Catholic hate group, ridiculed the Dodgers pathetic apology to them and said anti-Catholicism was the last acceptable prejudice in America. He then made a direct appeal to my Hispanic friends, arguing that they should be especially offended.</p><p>This is the religion of your family, Barron said. Of your </p>abuela<p> and </p>abuelo<p>, of your </p>familia<p>, of your </p>tradicin<p>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Latinos and the </p>Church  church <p>were used and abused by anti-immigrant forces in California last week  and Barron, along with his babbling brother bishops and the boycotters, has yet to say a word.</p><p>I'm talking about the</p> June 2 Friday <p>drop</p> -<p>off of 16 Venezuelan and Colombian migrants at the headquarters of the Diocese of Sacramento. </p><p>California </p>Attorney General Atty. Gen.<p> Rob Bonta said the documents the migrants carried showed that their journey on a charter flight from El Paso to New Mexico, then to Sacramento was arranged by the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That Sunshine State government agency had previously arranged similar trips to Democrat-run cities and states at the behest of </p> Republican <p>Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose budget last year set aside $12 million for the task.</p><p>After days of silence, a spokesperson for the agency characterized the flight, along with a subsequent one </p> on this past<p> Monday, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-06/florida-migrants-sacramento">as a voluntary relocation.</a></p><p>The spokesperson, Alecia Collins, also said that a contractor "ensured they made it safely to" Catholic Charities, a nationwide nonprofit that helps the poor but which Collins characterized as "used and funded by the federal government."</p><p>DeSantis, who's running for president, hasnt publicly commented on the matter. But when the Division of Emergency Management transported over 50 migrants to Marthas Vineyard </p>last  in <p>September, the governor snidely declared, We are not a sanctuary state, and its better [for migrants] to be able to go to a sanctuary jurisdiction.</p><p>Thats what makes the wholesale dumping of migrants on the Diocese of Sacramento so vile. Florida is making a mockery of Catholicism as much it's taking a jab at Newsom, who is a frequent DeSantis critic (and vice versa). </p> <p>Since the founding of this country, no Christian denomination has centered poor immigrants and refugees the way Catholicism has. The </p>C<p>church knew that its faithful  Germans, Irish, Italians, Czechs, Poles, Italians, Latinos</p>,<p> and so many more  needed a safe space to maintain their devotions and customs while navigating a new land.</p><p>Sanctuary is at the core of Catholic beliefs</p>,<p> because it's all over the Bible, from the Pentateuch to Psalms, the Gospel to the Second Epistle to the Corinthians, where </p>Paul <p>the Apostle </p> Paul <p>wrote that Christians "are the temple of the living God" and thus should act as such toward others. This embrace of the poor and meek, however, has long angered non-Catholics, who stereotyped each wave of Catholic migrants as unwashed and ignorant and the </p>C<p>church as an exploitative entity concerned only with itself.</p><p>The DeSantis administration's Sacramento stunt is nothing more than a cruel joke on the </p>C<p>church that takes advantage of Catholic goodwill while cleaning </p>their its <p>own hands of any responsibility. And this isn't the first time a Republican governor has pulled something like this: </p> L<p>ast year, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-19/migrants-transported-california-texas-abbott-desantis">Texas flew eight Venezuelan men to Sacramento</a> with no money and the address of Catholic Charities.</p><p>The Book of Proverbs tells believers to not mess with the poor, or "the Lord will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them." Tell that to the conservative Catholic activists who are decrying the Dodgers.</p><p>These people call Catholics like me apostates for opposing the </p>C<p>church's doubling down on culture war issues at the expense of social justice. Since the rise of Donald Trump, they have conveniently overlooked the part of the United States Conference </p>on  of <p>Catholic Bishops website stating that church teachings have consistently reinforced our moral obligation to treat the stranger as we would treat Christ himself. </p><p>They roll their eyes at statements like the one Pope Francis issued last month </p>Maylast month <p>that Catholics should ensure there will "always be a community ready to welcome, protect, promote and integrate everyone, without distinctions and without excluding anyone.</p><p>Conservative Catholic activists instead have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-06-02/column-desantis-and-trump-compete-to-take-the-most-extreme-stance-on-immigration">doubled down on the      right's   Right's anti-immigrant war,</a> arguing that the people lining up on the southern border to enter the United States arent like Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and thus deserve no refuge. They filled Trump's </p> C<p>abinet and defended his policies while still attending Mass with a straight face. </p><p>Tellingly, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article267349297.html" target="_blank">the three main architects</a> of Floridas migrant-shipping strategy have ties to the </p>C<p>church: DeSantis is a cradle Catholic;</p>,<p> his chief of staff James Uthmeier teaches religious education at St. Thomas More Co-Cathedral in Tallahassee, and public safety czar Larry Keefe used to be president of a Florida chapter of Catholic Charities.</p><p>Meanwhile, Catholics who actually read the Bible have stepped up to help the migrants stranded in Sacramento. Area nonprofits are offering shelter and food, while Sacramento Bishop Jaime Soto told the </p>press  media<p>, We recognize the humble presence of Jesus, and we hear his call to stand by the migrants.</p><p>Humble advocacy in times of crisis is what good Catholics do</p>,<p> because Jesus said good works are best done outside the limelight. He didn't like the Bishop Barrons of the world, describing them in the Gospel of Matthew as standing "on the street corners to be seen by men." </p><p>In fact, Christ had a name for them: </p>H<p>hypocrites.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Los estadounidenses han estado gozando de una seguridad laboral inusual, a pesar de la agresiva campaa de la Reserva Federal por enfriar la economa y combatir la inflacin mediante sus aumentos de las tasas de inters.</p><p>A comienzos de mayo, el banco central estadounidense aument su tasa referencial por dcima vez consecutiva. Han surgido indicios aislados de que los aumentos estn surtiendo efecto, pero, en trminos generales, el mercado laboral sigue estando a favor de los trabajadores.</p><p>Los empleadores aadieron la cifra robusta de 339.000 empleos el mes pasado, mucho ms de lo esperado. El reporte de la semana pasada ofreci un retrato ms bien positivo del mercado laboral, pero hubo algunas seales mixtas.

La misma noche en que el Ayuntamiento de La Mesa proclamara en junio el Mes del Orgullo en La Mesa, un miembro haba propuesto una enmienda al reglamento que prohibira de hecho que la bandera del orgullo ondeara sobre el Ayuntamiento. Era evidente que el Ayuntamiento de La Mesa votara en contra de esta propuesta. Aun as, docenas de activistas, aliados, jvenes y residentes de toda la vida acudieron a la reunin para apoyar a la comunidad LGBTQIA+ y declarar en contra de la enmienda.</p><p>Los testimonios personales y los argumentos bien razonados a favor de enarbolar la bandera del orgullo fueron poderosos. Yo fui uno de los varios clrigos que hablaron en contra de la enmienda y en apoyo de la comunidad LGBTQIA+. Una de las preocupaciones que yo y muchos otros planteamos fue el reciente aumento de la legislacin y la discriminacin anti-LGBTQIA+ en todo el pas. Hemos visto esta tendencia a nivel local, sobre todo en lo que respecta a la comunidad transgnero.</p><p>Las expresiones pblicas de odio en el Boo Bash de Hillcrest el pasado octubre y el vitriolo en el YMCA de Santee en enero fueron desgarradores. Aunque esos dos sucesos recibieron atencin pblica, desgraciadamente hay muchos ms casos cotidianos en los que personas transgnero y otras personas LGBTQIA+ sufren abusos y experimentan prejuicios. Estos actos deshumanizadores son afrentas a los valores evanglicos del amor, la compasin y la dignidad sagrada inherente a todos.</p><p>Mi funcin como pastor incluye celebrar la bondad de Dios manifestada en toda la creacin. Es una alegra ver cmo se enciende la chispa sagrada en los dems. En mi iglesia, y en muchas otras iglesias de San Diego, celebramos la luz divina en nuestros miembros, amigos y visitantes LGBTQIA+. Nuestra bandera del orgullo ondea todo el ao porque queremos que todo el mundo sepa que somos un lugar seguro para experimentar un amor inclusivo y liberador.</p><p>La Iglesia de la Comunidad de Kensington es una de las muchas iglesias abiertas y de afirmacin que creen que apoyar a la comunidad LGBTQIA+ es una responsabilidad sagrada, como la Iglesia Unida de Cristo de la Mesa, la Iglesia Unida de Cristo Pioneer Ocean View, la Iglesia Unida de Cristo Mission Hills, la Iglesia Unida de Cristo Christian Fellowship y la Iglesia Unida University City. A medida que la comunidad transgnero se convierte en un objetivo creciente de la violencia, la iglesia debe actuar. Tenemos y debemos seguir destacando las alegras y las luchas de la comunidad transgnero en nuestras oraciones, ensear un plan de estudios sobre fe y sexualidad inclusivo y afirmativo, ser conscientes del lenguaje sexista en nuestro culto y estar dispuestos a dar testimonio pblico. No perdemos la oportunidad de afirmar claramente el valor inherente e inconmensurable de nuestros hermanos transgnero.</p><p>En el Evangelio de Juan, Jess dice: "He venido para que tengan vida y la tengan en abundancia". En nuestra tradicin, afirmamos que hay abundancia de vida y de luz que supera el miedo y la mentira. A nuestros amigos transgnero y no binarios, vemos esa luz gloriosa en ustedes. Rezamos para que hayan escuchado la afirmacin de sus seres queridos y para que oigan las voces de apoyo como las que se manifestaron en la reunin del Ayuntamiento de La Mesa. Personas de todos los mbitos de la vida estn encontrando formas de manifestarse a tu favor. Deja que sean estas voces de amor las que escuches, porque estas voces dan testimonio de la verdad que dijo el antiguo telogo Ireneo de Lyon: "la gloria de Dios es el ser humano plenamente vivo".</p><p>Cuando la Iglesia proclame, de palabra y de obra, la buena nueva del amor indefectible, alimentar una cultura de aceptacin y afirmacin para la comunidad transgnero y para todos. En esta poca de divisin y discriminacin, la Iglesia no puede permanecer en silencio. Cuando las personas son objeto de difamacin pblica, la iglesia est llamada a alzar su voz. A los que se ven tentados por el miedo o las promesas vacas del odio, les proclamamos la verdad evanglica de que la gracia supera al juicio.</p><p>Y a la comunidad LGBTQIA+, aadimos con alegra nuestra voz al coro que canta su sagrada y hermosa diversidad. A ustedes les decimos: les necesitamos tal y como son. Su valor aporta fuerza a ms personas de las que imaginan. Su integridad inspira a los dems a dejar a un lado el autoengao y a ser ellos mismos. Su alegra hace del mundo un lugar mejor.</p><p>Soy ministro cristiano, y hay muchos clrigos que sienten como yo. Pero no hace falta ser ministro, ni cristiano, ni siquiera religioso, para ver la luz gloriosa en los dems. Solo tienes que mirar a alguien con dignidad y respeto. Las nicas creencias que necesitas son que podemos mejorar la forma en que nos tratamos unos a otros y que cada uno de nosotros tiene la capacidad de hacer del mundo un lugar ms luminoso.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Gen. Ken Paxton was charged Friday with making false statements to mortgage lenders to obtain $172 million in loans. The federal indictment of real estate developer Nate Paul is the result of a years-long FBI investigation  a probe Paxton involved his office in, setting off a chain of events that led to a separate federal probe of the attorney general and <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-26/texas-house-panel-impeachment-attorney-general-ken-paxton">his impeachment</a> </p> and suspension from office last month. Paul was charged with eight counts of making false statements while seeking loans from mortgage lenders in the U.S. and Ireland. There was no mention of Paxton or the attorney generals office during the hearing. Paul, 36, who entered the federal courtroom shackled and wearing jeans, a blue shirt and    sneakers,   Nikes, did not enter a plea during his initial appearance in an Austin court and did not visibly react as the charges were read. He was released ahead of trial but ordered to surrender his passport and inform the court of any travel outside Texas. Following the hearing, Paul left through a back door and climbed into a car in a gated area outside the courthouse. Paul is adamant that he is not guilty," defense attorney Gerry Morris said after    the  hearing, adding that he did not know when his client last spoke with Paxton. An attorney for Paxton, Dan Cogdell, had speculated Thursday evening that prosecutors might use the charges against Paul to try to get him to flip and cooperate in the investigation of the attorney general. Paul is accused of overstating his assets and understating his liabilities while seeking loans in 2017 and 2018, including by giving    a  financial institution false and counterfeit records. In one case, prosecutors said, Paul told banks he had $18 million in an account when he had less than $13,000. In another case laid out in the 23-page indictment, Paul is accused of having $28 million in liabilities but giving a credit union in 2018 a far lower number. The FBI on Thursday arrested a businessman at the center of the scandal that led to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-05-27/texas-house-launches-historic-impeachment-proceedings-against-attorney-general-ken-paxton">Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton's historic impeachment</a></p> amid new questions about their dealings raised by financial records that Paxton's lawyers divulged to try to clear him of bribery allegations. Austin real estate developer Nate Paul, 36, was taken into custody by federal agents and booked into an Austin jail in the afternoon, according to Travis County Sheriffs Office records. It was not immediately clear what charges led to his arrest, but the records showed that he was being held on a federal detainer for a felony.Paul's arrest followed a years-long federal investigation into his dealings  a probe that Paxton, a Republican, got his office involved in, setting off a chain of events that <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-26/texas-house-panel-impeachment-attorney-general-ken-paxton">ultimately led to his impeachment</a></p> last month.Lawyers for Paul did not immediately respond to requests for comment. One of Paxton's defense attorneys, Dan Cogdell, said he had no additional information on the arrest. The FBI declined to comment, and a spokesman for federal prosecutors in West Texas did not respond to inquiries. <p>FBI agents examining Paul's troubled real estate empire searched his Austin offices and palatial home in 2019. The following year, eight of Paxton s top deputies reported the attorney general to the FBI on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-24/texas-ag-ken-paxton-likely-broke-laws-republican-investigation">allegations of bribery and abusing his office</a>, </p> including for hiring an outside lawyer to examine the developers claims of wrongdoing by federal agents. to help Paul.

The impeachment accuses Paxton of using his office to help Paul over his  unproven    unproved  claims of an elaborate conspiracy to steal $200 million of the developers properties. The bribery counts say that in return the developer employed a woman with whom Paxton had an extramarital affair and paid for expensive renovations to the attorney generals million-dollar Austin home. Paxton's lawyers sought to rebut the latter claim this week by releasing <p>a bank statement that included a 2020 wire transfer purportedly showing Paxton, </p>and <p>not a donor, paying more than $120,000 for a home renovation. </p> But the document raised new questions about the mens dealings.<p>The wire transfer was dated Oct. 1, 2020  the same day Paxtons deputies signed a letter informing the head of human resources at the Texas attorney generals office that they had reported Paxton to the FBI.</p><p>The $121,000 payment was to Cupertino Builders, whose manager was an associate of Paul's, state corporation and court records show.</p><p>The company did not incorporate as a business in Texas until more than three weeks after the transaction took place.

Last year, one of those receivers wrote in a report that Cupertino Builders was used for fraudulent transfers from Paul's business.Last year a court-appointed overseer for some of Pauls companies wrote in a report that Cupertino Builders was used for fraudulent transfers from his business to Narsimha Raju Sagiraju, who was convicted of fraud in California in 2016.

They were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.Tony Buzbee, a prominent Houston attorney who was hired by Paxton over the weekend and led the news conference, said by email Thursday that receipts clearly demonstrate Paxton paid for the repairs himself. He did not address questions about the timing of the payments or about Cupertino Builders.Without any evidence the politicians leading this sham impeachment falsely accused [Attorney] General Paxton of not paying for the repairs to his home. That is a lie, Buzbee said.Since becoming just the third sitting official in Texas history to be impeached, Paxton has attacked the proceedings as politically motivated and rushed, saying he was never given the chance to rebut the accusations in the House.We have the receipts, Buzbee told reporters Wednesday as the documents flashed onscreen. This is the type of evidence we tried to offer them once we found out this foolishness was going on.Paxton is temporarily suspended from office pending the outcome of a trial in the Texas Senate that is set to begin no later than Aug. 28. The jury will be the members of the 31-seat Senate; one of them, Paxtons wife, Sen. Angela Paxton, has not said <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-30/texas-state-sen-angela-paxton-could-vote-in-trial-on-husband-ken-paxton-impeachment">whether she will recuse herself</a></p>.The Paxtons purchased their Austin home in 2018. When it was remodeled two years later, Paxtons former staff alleged in court documents, Paul was involved in the work.The city has no record of building permits from the time of the renovations. A different Austin contractor  not Cupertino Builders  received a federal grand jury subpoena in 2021 for records related to work on Paxtons home that started in January 2020.Cupertino Builders was formed in October 2020 and dissolved less than two years later, according to Texas corporation records. Its manager was Sagiraju, who said in a deposition in an unrelated case that he did consulting work for Pauls business and had an email address with Pauls company.Sagiraju acknowledged that he served prison time for securities fraud and grand theft in California before moving to Austin, according to a transcript of the deposition. He said that he was first introduced to Paul by a mutual friend before his prison term and that they later did a few projects together.Paxton was separately <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-texas-paxton-indicted-20150803-story.html">indicted on securities fraud charges</a></p> in 2015, though he has yet to stand trial.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The Russian Ministry of Defense then posted a video Tuesday on </p>the social media network<p> Telegram with text saying that it showed footage of the destruction of foreign armored vehicles, including Leopard tanks.</p><p>The video was shown extensively by Russian state-controlled broadcasters and news sites, which said it was recorded from the thermal-imaging system of a KA-52 Alligator attack helicopter.

In Annecy, the French leader thanked medical workers, police, firefighters, civilians  including Henri  and others whose first aid and swift interventions helped save lives during the attack in the town's lakeside park.

Even after being slashed at, Henri continued to harry the attacker by pursuing him inside a playground  where the man repeatedly stabbed a child in a stroller  and then out of the park again, carrying his backpacks all the while. He appeared to hurl one of the packs at the assailant at one point and then pick it up again to take another swing.</p><p>Henri's father, Franois, said he believed that his son's dogged pursuit helped dissuade the attacker from stabbing more victims before police wrestled him to the ground.</p> From the archives: 16 bodies found in the French Alps after suspected cult ritual<p>He took a lot of risks when he wasnt armed, with just his backpacks, the father told the Associated Press. He didnt stop running after him for many minutes, to stop him from coming back and massacring the kids even more. I think he prevented carnage by scaring him off. Really very courageous.</p><p>Franois asked that his and his son's last name not be published, expressing concerns about their family being thrust suddenly and inadvertently into the public eye at a time of shock and outrage in France provoked by the viciousness of Thursday's attack and the helplessness of its young victims.</p><p>The profile of the suspected attacker, a 31-year-old Syrian refugee, also fueled renewed political debate about French migration policies. Critics on the right and far-right of French politics quickly dusted off their arguments that French migration controls are too lax.</p><p>For his part, Henri shied away from the hero label. He said he tried to act as all French people should act, or would act.</p> Thousands await help  if it ever comes  in Russian-occupied Ukraine after dam burst<p>In that moment, you unplug your brain and react a bit like an animal by instinct," he told broadcaster BFMTV. "It was impossible for me to witness that without reacting.</p><p>I am far from alone in having reacted. Many other people around started, like me, to run after him to try to scare him, push him away. And other people immediately went over to the children to take care of the injured.</p><p>Henri added: I remember there was also a municipal worker who arrived from the right with a large plastic shovel to try to hit him.</p><p>French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said Friday that all four children underwent surgery for their life-threatening knife wounds and are under constant medical surveillance.</p> Trump says he's been indicted in special counsel investigation into classified documents<p>Their situation is stable, she said.</p><p>Government spokesman Olivier Veran, a medical doctor by training, said that two of the children remained in critical condition.</p>President Emmanuel <p>Macron and his wife, Brigitte, traveled to a hospital treating three of the four children.

Psychiatrists are evaluating him, Veran said.</p><p>Henri's father said </p>that in a phone conversation after the attack,<p> his son </p> told him after the attack<p> </p>told me <p>that the Syrian was incoherent, saying lots of strange things in different languages, invoking his father, his mother, all the gods.</p><p>In short, he was possessed by who knows what, but possessed by folly, thats certain, the father told the AP.</p><p>He said he did not show the disturbing video of the attack to his other children and his wife, and added that he and his wife had trouble sleeping even after learning that Henri was safe.</p><p>We thanked providence and his guardian angels, he said.</p> Mt.

Cartoons popularity in the tattoo community and his commercial success as a<b> </b>graphic designer and in the fashion industry had, in a sense, hampered his</p> <p>ability to move forward as a fine artist  he didnt have time to take a step back and create the large body of work needed for a solo show.</p><p>Hes been busy, Gastman says. Hes one of the most sought-after tattoo artists, sought after as a painter and designer of cars, for commercial work and everything else. Being able to sit down for six months and make paintings is not something thats been easy for him to do. Hes never made this many paintings [at once] before. For this show, it was: Lets go for it. Lets do the big show. Tell the stories that have been in your head forever.</p><p>The exhibition was hatched when, in 2022, Beyond the Streets opened a flagship <a href="https://beyondthestreets.com/" target="_blank">bricks-and-mortar space</a> on La Brea </p>Ave.  Avenue<p> along with the adjacent <a href="https://control.gallery/" target="_blank">Control Gallery</a> to showcase contemporary art.

It touches on Cartoons roots as a graffiti artist, his foray into sign painting, his passion for lowrider custom-car culture and the years, in the early 90s, on the road<b> </b>with his creative partner, photographer and director <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-05-14/la-et-lowrider-moments-in-film-television">Estevan Oriol</a>, immersed in the </p>hip hop hip-hop<p> scene. Not to mention his pivot to tattoo art at the time, a game-changer for his career that elevated his presence as an artist.</p><p>Stepping away from the grind of commercial work and clients, he says, I was able to paint for me and my peers and my family. The freedom has been very special, a time for self</p> -<p>refection: </p> W<p>hat do I want to say on my platform? Who am I as an artist? How can I take 30 years and put it into a couple of rooms, show my evolution?</p><p>The answer, Cartoon says, was an exhibition he describes as a collage of my memories and fantasies.</p><p>The show is especially personal. At its heart, its about relationships  between Cartoon and his family, friends and tattoo clients throughout the years, but also his relationship to music and cars and art as well as, more generally, humans relationships to work and death. Characters appear repeatedly in the paintings, amalgams of figures in Cartoons life. His tattoo designs show up on their body parts and appear around the gallery. Vintage cars hes owned populate the canvases.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4a/1b/74674efd4cb98ff94e4560dede00/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-010.jpg"></figure><p>Cars saved Cartoons life, he says.

"We started writing on walls and terrorizing a bit. I saw friends get incarcerated or pass away due to street life, and that definitely pushed me into the car world. It was a way to still be cool with the fellas, but not gangster activities.</p><p>All the work<b> </b>in the show is made with automotive paint and using the technique of airbrush painting. Cartoon tattoos in the black and gray <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-tattoo-show-nhm-20171126-story.html">fine-line style</a><b> </b></p>that<p> developed in prisons in the West and on the streets of East L.A. in the 70s.<b> </b>As such, most of his paintings on canvas<b> </b>are rendered in black, white and gray tones. But three paintings in the show<b> </b> inspired by cars  stand in sharp contrast. Glossy, bursting with color and framed with shimmering, delicate line work, theyre painted on sloping pieces of hand-hammered aluminum that mimic the look of car hoods. The works are especially labor intensive, repeatedly sanded, primed and painted, then sealed. The curved metal and high gloss surface create reflections that lend the works an almost three-dimensional quality.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/9d/c849ebb34c78a9a7ad8a3edb8a06/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-013.jpg"></figure><p>Clouds, a recurring theme in Cartoons work over the decades, factor in heavily. His cityscapes appear under skies blanketed with stormy or pillowy clouds. Other canvases, filled to the edges with clouds alone, contain hidden faces  Easter eggs  in the nooks and shadows.</p><p>When I started traveling, Id look out the window of an airplane, just looking up at the sky, and they just always seemed so innocent, Cartoon says of clouds. They look like paintings to me. Ive been drawing them since I was a kid. Theyre free form and always flowing, moving. Its that dream state.</p><p>Cartoons fantasies in some of the paintings are as vibrant as his memories of real-life experiences  often more so, he says. One painting on aluminum depicts Mexican Marilyn Monroe <b> </b>Mariposa  and El Vez, he says. Bathed in aqua and cobalt, the characters rise out of a 57 Chevy Bel Air convertible. The image captures Cartoons affection for the glamorous, noirish 1940s and 1950s.</p><p>My father grew up then, he says. I think I spent a lot of my life fantasizing about living in that era and buying all the cars at the dealership. Go back in my time machine to 1959: Hey, how much for that used 57 convertible? $1,200</p> dollars<p>, you say? O</p> K<p>, wrap it up. Ill take three. This is the American dream. In this case, the Mexican American dream.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4f/47/72c9be624b1fb77bed9368c36b4e/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-012.jpg"></figure><p>Cartoon listens to classic soul music from the 60s and 70s when he paints  hence, the title of the exhibition, from a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-12-15/aint-too-proud-otis-williams-temptations-ahmanson-la">Temptations</a> song  and music<b> </b>from those eras will play in the background in the galleries.</p><p>There will also be a large-scale tattoo station installation on view, filled with Cartoons hand-painted signs, an ode to his history in the medium and still-active tattoo shop in<b> </b>Santa Monica.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>This is where my canvas is breathing and walking around, he says.

Its glossy midnight blue. It has a broad, proud nose "with the attitude of Al Capone,"<b> </b>he says, and it features a mural of gangsters on both sides and the trunk.</p><p>Im a storyteller, Cartoon says. This show, its the story of good times and bad times, the yin and yang of life, positives and negatives, the struggle and the joy and the build of it all.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s, he adds, he witnessed the collision of emerging hip hop, tattoo culture, street art and street fashion as well as evolving lowrider car culture and the growing<b> </b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-15/always-a-collector-cheech-marin-brings-his-art-to-riverside">Chicano art movement</a><b> </b><b> </b>all of which are storylines in the show.</p><p>I was told back then to find your part.

Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) described the proposal as a compromise and said many issues could still be fought out when congressional committees begin considering changes in the legislation next week.</p><p>The FAA is under fire for a shortage of air traffic controllers, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/flight-delays-us-faa-updates-5805d15f520de8eadf52abb7b170487f">aging technology</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/airplanes-close-call-san-francisco-southwest-ec9df0e1a2ff8038992c4d152d8b2449">close calls between planes</a>. The agency has a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/faa-acting-administrator-biden-buttigieg-079bbc6c1abb13b404946c75a06ec311">new acting administrator</a> with no aviation experience. It has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader for more than a year, since the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-stephen-dickson-federal-aviation-administration-8785ab0a556dbb20eec2d04638b2dd53">last one resigned</a> halfway through his term.</p><p>One provision of the House bill would let airlines advertise the base airfare  excluding taxes and fees  as long as they include a link to the all-in price or disclose it some other way. That would weaken an Obama administration rule that airlines have long fought to kill, and consumer advocates are unhappy about the House move.</p><p>These protections were hard fought and took years to enact, said William McGee, an aviation expert at the American Economic Liberties Project. Any consumer can tell you that online airline bookings are confusing enough. The last thing we need is to roll back an existing protection that provides effective transparency.</p> 'It was horrible': Stranded Southwest passengers still waiting to recoup costs from airline meltdown<p>The House committee leaders also propose to let people become airline pilots with less time in the cockpit. The bill would not change the requirement for 1,500 hours of training, but it would allow 250 hours  up from the current 100 hours  to occur in simulators rather than flying a plane.</p><p>Airlines, particularly the smaller ones that operate regional flights, have long fought against the 1,500-hour rule, which already has exemptions that let military pilots and graduates of some aviation schools qualify with fewer hours. The rule was put in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ae9faf4921d34189acfcc895ea48f677">after a 2009 crash that killed 50 people.</a></p><p>Garth Thompson, head of the Air Line Pilots Assn. </p>Association<p> unit at United Airlines, said it is a horrible idea" to weaken the rule.</p><p>That rule, like so many federal aviation regulations, is written in blood, literally, Thompson said. That regulation came about because of the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/accidentreports/reports/aar1001.pdf" target="_blank">Colgan Air crash</a> and other crashes that involved experience issues.</p><p>Asked about changes in airfare advertising and pilot training, Larsen said, It's something we can live with. The change in pilot training rules, he said, is a priority of the Transportation Committee's Republican chairman, Sam Graves of Missouri, and both sides had to compromise during drafting of the bill.</p><p>Elsewhere in the bill, Larsen said, Democrats were able to include provisions they wanted, such as those covering wheelchair accessibility.</p><p>The bill also includes provisions aimed at improving airport infrastructure and the supply of sustainable aviation fuel. It would require airline planes to be outfitted with better cockpit voice recorders and, for the first time, cockpit video recorders to improve accident investigations. Pilots have opposed the video recorders.</p><p>Some other contentious topics were left out, including raising the mandatory retirement age of 65 for pilots and easing restrictions on flights from Reagan Washington National Airport in northern Virginia. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Remote workers often complain that, because they are constantly reachable at home, they are also constantly asked to work.</p><p>Mexico, like many other countries, saw a big increase in remote working during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. While office space occupancy is inching back up, remote work seems to be a trend that has caught on. </p><p>The trend is so pronounced that some office buildings on bustling downtown boulevards are being converted into apartments, hospitals and stores.</p><p>The Labor Department said bosses are responsible for paying for the electricity, printers and other equipment used when working at home. According to the new rules, if an employee's home isn't safe, well-</p> lightedlit <p>and well-ventilated, they can't be forced to work there.</p><p>Inspectors can visit a worker's home, or employees may be asked to take pictures of their home, to prove that it meets labor requirements. </p><p>Remote workers cannot be paid less than those who go to an office, and they must have set work hours.</p><p>According to the commercial real estate firm Newmark, Mexico City's office market has shown slight signs of recovery since the pandemic. In a first-quarter 2023 research report, it said the city's office vacancy rate had declined to 23.4%, from 24.5% one year ago.</p><p>As in many parts of the world, some employers have adopted a mixed or hybrid model in which workers come into the office only part of the week. The new rules apply only to those who work remotely at least 40% of the week.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The bill also prohibits the use of rivers or groundwater at the illegal site, as well as criminalizes seizing the identity papers of migrant workers who tend the plants or threatening to report them for deportation.</p><p>Under the bill, local governments are authorized to file a claim of lien against property used for illicit marijuana, if the owner doesnt pay for the cleanup. </p><p>A leader of the states <a href="https://www.latimes.com/topic/cannabis">cannabis</a> and alcohol regulatory agency has said southern Oregon is to marijuana what Bordeaux is to wine. But the state faces challenges on two fronts: The regulated industry has a glut of product that has slashed prices and profit margins, and there has been huge growth in illegal pot farms operating under the guise of growing hemp, which became legal nationally in 2018. </p><p>After passing the Senate and House, the House Speaker Dan Rayfield signed the measure Wednesday, over the objections of some Republicans. Democratic Gov. Tina Kotek is expected to sign it next week.</p><p>This is just an assault on property rights here in the state of Oregon, GOP Sen. Dennis Linthicum said on the Senate floor. </p><p>But Democratic Sen. Jeff Golden, of Ashland, said property owners should know something is amiss when they are approached at the beginning of the growing season with requests to lease their property for tens, sometimes hundreds of thousand dollars for a single year.</p><p>Witnesses have described backpacks with thousands of dollars in cash being handed over to landowners and getting numerous offers to buy.</p><p>We pay CASH and offer a fast close, says one letter received by a landowner last year, one of three offers. </p><p>Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler told lawmakers that after police raid illegal pot farms, neither landowners nor the suspects make efforts to remove the cheaply built greenhouses, known as hoop houses, latrines, and other debris, including plastics and chemicals.</p><p>Frankly, it's an eyesore for our community, with no means to deal with it, Sickler said.</p><p>Some two years ago, the ideal growing conditions began attracting criminal gangs from Mexico, Russia and other countries, police said. Thousands of hoop houses cropped up and police were overwhelmed, nailing only a fraction of the sites. Workers at these farms often live in squalid conditions and use open latrines, and they are sometimes cheated out of their pay.</p><p>Due to persistent police raids, which netted over 100 tons of illegal marijuana across the state last year, the grow sites have become smaller and more dispersed. For example, on Thursday, Josephine County Sheriff's deputies and other officers raided a property in Cave Junction and destroyed about 2,000 marijuana plants and 100 pounds of processed marijuana.</p><p>Landowners who have been intimidated and suffered environmental damage from illegal grow sites are applauding the bill.</p><p>At least most of the landowners knew what they were doing was wrong. I believe this measure will help to stem the tide, said Jack Dwyer, who has a house near the community of Selma. In 2021, Dwyer said a large illegal grow site nearby siphoned all the water from a creek that runs through his property, causing it to run dry. </p><p>Christopher Hall, who works to engage the public in water stewardship, said the bill shows that Oregon officials understand the problem of large-scale illicit cannabis operations and are committed to solving it. </p><p>The illicit sites not only turn streams into gravel roads but also lead to serious human rights violations and dumping of trash, sewage, chemicals, and other waste into ditches, riparian areas, and streams," he said.</p><p>The Senate approved the measure before <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-31/gop-walkout-in-oregon-senate-hits-record-fourth-week">GOP senators began a walkout </a>on May 3 over Democratic measures on abortion, gender-affirming care and gun safety. The House passed the marijuana bill on a 53-3 vote on May 31. The bill will now go to Kotek to sign into law, taking immediate effect.</p><p>"The governor supports cracking down on illegal cannabis operations that have been prevalent in southern Oregon, said Elisabeth Shepard, Kotek's spokesperson.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That doesnt factor in her <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-14/with-the-status-of-student-loans-is-in-the-air-scammers">student loans</a>, which have been on hold since the start of the pandemic and are estimated to cost $300 a month. The pause in repayment has been a lifeline keeping the 25-year-old afloat.</p><p>I dont even know where I would begin to budget that money, said Chanthanouvong, who works in marketing in San Francisco.</p><p>Now, after more than three years, the lifeline is being pulled away.</p><p>More than 40 million Americans will be on the hook for federal student loan payments starting in late August under the terms of a debt ceiling deal approved by Congress last week. The Biden administration has been targeting that timeline for months, but the deal ends any hope of a further extension of the pause, which has been prolonged while the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-02/editorial-court-should-not-yank-away-lifeline-for-people-drowning-in-student-debt">Supreme Court decides the presidents debt cancellation</a>.</p><p>A Republican measure overturning Bidens student loan cancellation plan passed the Senate last week, but the president vetoed the bill Wednesday.</p> Anxious about your student loan debt? Beware of offers that are too good to be true<p>Without cancellation, the Education Department predicts borrowers will fall behind on their loans at historic rates. Among the most vulnerable are those who finished college during the pandemic. Millions have never had to make a loan payment, and their bills will soon come amid soaring inflation and forecasts of economic recession.</p><p>Advocates fear it will add a financial burden that younger borrowers cant afford.</p><p>I worry that were going to see levels of default of new graduates that weve never seen before, said Natalia Abrams, president of the nonprofit Student Debt Crisis Center. </p><p>Chanthanouvong earned a bachelors in sociology from the University of California, Merced, in 2019. She couldnt find a job for a year, leaving her to rely on odd jobs for income. She found a full-time job last year, but at $70,000, her salary barely covers the cost of living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Im not going out. I dont buy Starbucks every day. Im cooking at home, she said. And sometimes, I dont even have $100 after everything.</p><p>Under President </p>Joe <p>Bidens cancellation plan, Chanthanouvong would be eligible to get $20,000 of her debt erased, leaving her owing $5,000. But she isnt banking on the relief. Instead, she invited her partner to move in and split rent. The financial pinch has them postponing or rethinking major life milestones. </p> Editorial: Supreme Court should not yank away the lifeline for people drowning in student debt<p>My partner and I agreed, maybe we dont want kids, she said. Not because we dont want them, but because it would be financially irresponsible for us to bring a human being into this world.</p><p>Out of the more than 44 million federal student loan borrowers, about 7 million are below the age of 25, according to data from the Education Department. Their average loan balance is less than $14,000, lower than any other age group.</p><p>Yet borrowers with lower balances are the most likely to default. It's fueled by millions who drop out before graduating, along with others who graduate but struggle to find good jobs. Among those who defaulted in 2021, the median loan balance was $15,300, and the vast majority had balances under $40,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p>Resuming student loan payments will cost U.S. consumers $18 billion a month, the investment firm Jefferies has estimated. The hit to household budgets is ill-timed for the overall economy, Jefferies says, because the United States is widely believed to be on the brink of a recession.</p><p>Despite the student loan moratorium, Americans mostly didn't bank their savings, according to Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. So theyll likely have to cut back on other things  travel, restaurants  to fit resumed loan payments into their budgets. Belt-tightening could hurt an economy that relies heavily on consumer spending.</p> Letters to the Editor: Is canceling student debt fair? <p>Noshin Hoque graduated from Stony Brook University early in the pandemic with about $20,000 in federal student loans. Instead of testing the 2020 job market, she enrolled </p>at in<p> a masters program in social work at Columbia University, borrowing $34,000 more.</p><p>With the payments paused, she felt a new level of financial security. She cut costs by living with her parents in New York City and her job at a nonprofit paid enough to save money and help her parents.</p><p>She recalls splurging on a $110 polo shirt as a Fathers Day gift for her dad.</p><p>Being able to do stuff for my parents and having them experience that luxury with me has just been such a plus, said Hoque, who works for Young Invincibles, a nonprofit that supports student debt cancellation.</p><p>It gave her the comfort to enter a new stage of life. She got married to a recent medical school graduate, and they're expecting their first child in November. At the same time, theyre bracing for the crush of loan payments, which will cost at least $400 a month combined. They hope to pay more to avoid interest, which is prohibited for them as practicing Muslims.</p><p>To prepare, they stopped eating at restaurants. They canceled a vacation to Italy. Money they wanted to put toward their childs education fund will go to their loans instead.</p><p>Were back to square one of planning our finances, she said. I feel that so deeply.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>Even the logistics of making payments will be a hurdle for newer borrowers, said Rachel Rotunda, director of government relations at National </p>Association  Assn.<p> of Student Financial Aid Administrators. They'll need to find out who their loan servicers are, choose a repayment plan and learn to navigate the payment system.</p><p>The volume of borrowers going back on the system at the same time  this has never happened before, Rotunda said. It's fair to say it's going to be bumpy.</p><p>The Education Department has promised to make the restart of payments as smooth as possible. In a statement, the agency said it will continue to push for Biden's debt cancellation as a way to reduce borrowers' debt load and ease the transition.</p><p>For Beka Favela, 30, the payment pause provided independence. She earned a master's in counseling last year, and her job as a therapist allowed her to move out of her parents' house.</p><p>Without making payments on her $80,000 in student loans, she started saving. She bought furniture. She chipped away at credit card debt. But once the pause ends, she expects to pay about $500 a month. It will consume most of her disposable income, leaving little for surprise costs. If finances get tighter, she wonders </p>if  whether<p> she'll have to move back home.</p><p>I dont want to feel like I'm regressing in order to make ends meet, said Favela, of Westmont, Ill. I just want to keep moving forward. I'm worried, is that going to be possible?</p>AP Economics Wwriter Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

After his rent surged past $1,000 a month in early 2021 he feared he would have to move out  until he got a $7,300 lifeline from the federal <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-06-09/state-reaches-settlement-over-pandemic-rent-relief-what-tenants-and-landords-need-to-know">Emergency Rental Assistance Program</a>.</p><p>That kept him in his apartment and even helped him build a small nest egg. Now graduated and working full time, hes a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-03-29/buying-a-socal-house-the-great-home-hunt-guide">first-time home buyer</a>.</p><p>Bautista is one of millions of renters who benefited from temporary programs put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on evictions, income support  and the rental assistance program. One of the most ambitious investments in emergency housing in the nations history, it has disbursed $46 billion in aid to state and local governments since early 2021 and kept millions of people in their homes, according to an analysis of government data by Bloomberg News.</p><p>With rents still climbing and the economy at risk of a recession, housing advocates are urging the Biden administration to keep helping tenants. That will be hard under legislation signed into law last weekend that suspended the nations borrowing limit as it clawed back unused pandemic aid and imposed caps on future increases in the federal budget.</p><p>We are facing an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet Republican lawmakers are insisting on slashing funding for and jeopardizing the future of critical housing affordability programs that support working families, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said in a statement.</p> State reaches settlement over pandemic rent relief: What tenants and landlords need to know <p>Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau show that, on average, 48.46 million people reported being caught up on their rent during the first quarter of this year, 4.7 million more than before the Emergency Rental Assistance Program was put in place as the economy was reeling from shutdowns. Even though the estimated number of renters in the country increased during the period, the number of people behind on their rent fell.</p><p>These policies drove eviction filing rates to historic lows," </p>according to <p>a <a href="https://evictionlab.org/covid-era-policies-cut-eviction-filings-by-more-than-half/">report</a> from the Eviction Lab </p> stated<p>. Eviction filings were cut by more than half </p> inof<p> 31 cities they sampled, largely due to COVID-era policies, according to the lab, a housing research group at Princeton University.</p><p>Nevertheless, Republicans have shown little appetite for continuing pandemic-era programs, including for rent assistance, as they seek to reduce the federal budget deficit.</p><p>Progressives attempts to make crisis programs permanent, even after an emergency ends, is just another example of Democrats spending taxpayer money we dont have, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a key negotiator on the debt limit bill, said in a statement. Now its time to end this program.</p><p>The Treasury Department let states, counties and cities use the emergency rent aid in one of three ways: on direct assistance to households, housing stability measures and administrative expenses. About $33 billion of the $46 billion was used for direct assistance to more than 7 million households, according to a Bloomberg evaluation of Treasury data.</p> L.A. County supervisors propose adopting permanent rental protections<p>States, on average, sent 70% of their used funds directly to tenants and landlords, and those that spent most of the money for direct assistance tended to help more tenants get up to date on their rent  suggesting the program was having the desired effect. California, for example, used more than 75% of the $5.6 billion allocated to it from the rental assistance program for direct aid to tenants and landlords. The result: an average of 986,000 more renters were caught up on rent than before the program was established. New York saw about 440,000 residents catch up, or almost 10% of the tenants in the state.</p><p>North Dakota spent less on rental payments and it is one of four states  Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia are the others  that saw the number of tenants behind on rent grow.</p><p>Direct assistance was limited to renters with an income below 80% of the areas median income and who were able to demonstrate that they were at risk of homelessness and </p>and<p> were suffering a financial hardship because of the pandemic.</p><p>Bautista, the former University of Texas student, met the eligibility </p> requirements<p>. He now works as a management assistant for a low-income housing coalition. On the side, he doles out affordable housing advice to college students and recent grads.</p><p>Im not supposed to be where I am today, he said. This program changed my life.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>The Treasury Department and state governments were criticized&nbsp;for dispersing money too slowly at the programs onset. Some states even had their funding reallocated.</p><p>The Treasury said it tracked some information</p> ,<p> like the number of dollars distributed, the number of households served</p>,<p> and the demographics of its applicants. However, program administrators said they didn't have the bandwidth to measure or poll whether recipients were able to catch up on rent while it was dispersing funds.</p><p>We faced a race with time. Experts were projecting a tsunami of evictions if we did not get the emergency rental payments flowing before the eviction moratorium ended, Gene Sperling, a senior White House advisor and coordinator of the Biden administrations American Rescue Plan, said in a statement. The fact that we actually saw eviction rates go below historic averages was proof we did get payments out in time.</p><p>Data on evictions is hard to come by, said Peter Hepburn, associate director of the Eviction Lab. There are more than 3,000 independently operated county courts that handle evictions, many of which often keep documents sealed, undigitized or both.</p><p>The lab credits the pandemic measures for preventing at least 800,000 evictions in 31 U.S. metropolitan areas it studied.</p><p>The rental assistance program itself has been a godsend and a blessing for everyone who has been able to use those funds to remain housed, said Mark Fessler, deputy director of litigation and training at the nonprofit South Carolina Legal Services.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

This week has been relatively quiet for markets, even with the benchmark S&amp;P 500  index gaining enough Thursday to close 20% above its October low, entering a new bull market. More  movement is likely  fireworks could arrive next week when the U.S. government releases the latest monthly updates on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels. The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest move on interest rates. Column: Forget the metaverse. For $3,500, Apple offers a new way to be alone So far, the economy has been able to avoid a <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-08-04/how-to-recession-proof-your-life-amid-economic-uncertainty">recession</a></p>  even though the Fed has jacked rates up at a furious pace for more than a year in hopes of driving down inflation. The highest rates since 2007 have helped inflation come down some, but its still above everyones comfort level. That means the big question on Wall Street is whether inflation will recede quickly enough for the Fed to take it easier on interest rates before the economy falls into a recession. A stronger-than-expected report on hiring last week raised hopes that the economy can slide through its troubles without a recession, but many other areas have already begun to crack. Besides helping to cause&nbsp;three-high profile U.S. banking failures&nbsp;since March, high interest rates have also pushed the manufacturing industry to shrink for months. The banking industrys turmoil has also caused banks to make it tougher for customers to get loans, which adds more stress to the economy. I cant tell you precisely when this recession will come to roost, but it feels likes its coming, said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Asset Management Group. And the market is not priced for it. I dont want to be dramatic and say a day of reckoning is coming, but there will be a wake-up call. Agati is expecting only a modest recession, not a deeply painful one like the downturns following the 2007-08 financial crisis and the 2020 onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. But she is concerned by how high the stock market has climbed, driven in particular by just a small handful of stocks. How to recession-proof your life amid economic uncertainty This is the market thinking were going to muddle along and then the Fed is going to get out of the drivers seat: The Fed is going to cut rates, and were going to power into 2024, Agati said. And I think thats awfully delusional. She says rates could climb higher than Wall Street expects and stay high for longer than investors are forecasting because inflation has remained too stubbornly high. The wide expectations among traders is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its meeting next week. If it does, that will be the first meeting where the Fed hasnt hiked rates in more than a year. After that, the widespread bet is that the Fed may raise rates one more time in July before going on hold or even cutting rates by the end of the year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Adobe rose another 3.4% to add to its 5% leap from the day before following its announcement of a new artificial-intelligence offering for businesses. It joined a frenzy around AI that has sent a select group of stocks soaring, such as a 165% surge for chipmaker Nvidia so far this year. Proponents say <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-03-31/column-afraid-of-ai-the-startups-selling-it-want-you-to-be">AI</a></p>  will be the next revolution to remake the economy, while critics say its inflating the next bubble. Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to beEuropean markets were lower and Asian markets closed higher overnight.Trading has been listless throughout the week amid a lack of any big market-moving reports or news. The benchmark S&amp;P index still gained enough ground by Thursday to close 20% above its October low, officially entering a new bull market.Technology stocks, which have been responsible for much of Wall Street's gains, helped lead the way on Friday. Microsoft rose 1.4% and chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 gives more weight to many Big Tech companies because of their size. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.74% from 3.72% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.62% from 4.52%.The latest round of corporate earnings reports is nearing a close, but late reports are still managing to move some stocks. Ski resort operator Vail Resorts fell 6.9% after reporting disappointing results. DocuSign rose 1.8% after reporting strong earnings.Wall Street will have more potentially market-moving economic updates to deal with next week. The government will release May data for inflation at the consumer level on Tuesday and retail sales data on Thursday. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest update on interest rates.AP Business Wwriter Yuri Kageyama contributed  to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He was 85.</p><p>Watt died in Arizona on May 27, his son Eric Watt said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>In an administration divided between so-called pragmatists and hard-liners, few stood as far to the right at the time as Watt, who once labeled the environmental movement as preservation vs. people and the general public as a clash between liberals and Americans.</p><p>In that sense, Watt foreshadowed combative interior secretaries like Ryan Zinke and David Bernhardt, who, like Watt, aggressively pushed to grant oil, gas and coal leases on public land, increase offshore drilling and limit expansion of national parks and monuments. </p><p>While no ones death should be celebrated, he was the worst of MAGA before it was invented," tweeted David Donger of the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, referring to former President Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.</p><p>Watt and his supporters saw him as an upholder of President Reagans core conservative values, but opponents were alarmed by his policies and offended by his comments. In 1981, shortly after he was appointed, the Sierra Club collected more than 1 million signatures seeking Watts ouster and criticized such actions as clear-cutting federal lands in the Pacific Northwest, weakening environmental regulations for strip mining and hampering efforts to curtail air pollution in Californias Yosemite Valley.</p><p>With his bald head and thick glasses, he became the rare interior secretary recognizable to the general public, for reasons beyond the environment. He characterized members of a coal advisory panel using derogatory language and in 1983 tried to ban music from Fourth of July festivities on the National Mall, saying it attracted the wrong element.</p><p>The Beach Boys had been recent mall headliners, and their fans included President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. With Watts statement facing widespread mockery, the Reagans invited the Beach Boys for a special White House visit. Watt, meanwhile, was summoned to receive a plaster model of a foot with a hole in it.</p> Interior secretary seeks to rid U.S. of derogatory place names<p>In his 1985 book The Courage of a Conservative, Watt wrote that the controversy actually arose because I was a conservative. Members of a liberal press saw an opportunity to create a controversy by censoring the facts and avoiding the real issues. He said the initial stories about the rock music ban only mentioned that the Beach Boys had performed in the past. Yet before we knew what was happening, banner headlines proclaimed that I had banned the Beach Boys. I was astonished.</p><p>Cutting regulations was his primary mission. Between the time he was confirmed as interior secretary in 1981 until he resigned under pressure in 1983, Watt implemented an offshore leasing program that offered virtually the entire U.S. coastline for oil and gas drilling and held the largest coal lease sale in history, auctioning off 1.1 billion tons </p>(1 billion metric tons)<p> of coal in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming.</p><p>Watt tripled the amount of onshore land being leased for oil and gas exploration and doubled the acreage leased for geothermal resources.</p><p>Watt did spend $1 billion to restore and improve national parks and added 2,800 square miles </p>(7,300 square kilometers)<p> to the nations wilderness system. And his efforts to exploit natural resources made America stronger, he wrote to Reagan in October 1983.</p><p>Our excellent record for managing the natural resources of this land is unequaled  because we put people in the environmental equation, Watt wrote.</p><p>But eight days after writing to the president, he rode horseback into a cow pasture down the road from Reagans California ranch to announce his resignation. He was succeeded by a longtime Reagan aide, William Clark.</p><p>I had outworn my usefulness, Watt said of his decision, adding that others wouldn't get off my case about his insulting coal advisory panel comment.</p><p>Watt was born Jan. 31, 1938, in Lusk, Wyo., and his family later moved to Wheatland, Wyo., where his father practiced law. He attended the University of Wyoming, graduating in 1960 and obtaining a law degree two years later.</p> Interior Department adds $103 million for wildfire hazards and land rehabilitation<p>In 1962, Watt became a personal assistant to former Gov. Milward L. Simpson, and he went to Washington after Simpson was elected to the U.S. Senate later that year. In 1966-69, he helped develop policies on such issues as pollution, mining, public lands and energy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, then in early 1969 he joined the Nixon administration as an Interior Department undersecretary.</p><p>In 1975, President Ford appointed him to the Federal Power Commission.</p><p>While Jimmy Carter was president, Watt worked in the private sector as president and chief legal officer of the pro-development Mountain States Legal Foundation in Denver.</p><p>He did consulting work after leaving the Reagan administration, at one point turning heads when he agreed to represent </p>Indian Native American<p> tribes in oil operations and hotel developments after previously labeling </p>Indian Indigenous<p> reservations the failure of socialism. He also accepted six-figure consulting fees to represent developers of a federally subsidized housing project.</p><p>He moved back to Wyoming in 1986 and set up a law office in Jackson, taught at his alma mater and served as a legal consultant and speaker.</p><p>But his consulting work involving federal housing money came under scrutiny in the late 1980s when an investigation was launched into corruption in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p><p>In 1996, he pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor for withholding documents from a grand jury investigating HUD. He was fined $5,000, put on five years probation and ordered to perform community service. He said he had made a serious mistake and hoped to get on with a constructive role in society.</p><p>Over the years, Watt expressed fears that unless they were stopped, radical environmental movements like Earth First! would persuade the cowards of Congress to ban all hunting, eliminate all logging and livestock grazing on public lands and further jeopardize the minerals industries.</p><p>He lived in his later years in Wickenburg, Ariz., with his wife, Leilani.</p>Associated Press writer Matthew Daly in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He was 93.</p><p>Robertson's death Thursday was announced by his broadcasting network. No cause was given.</p><p>The founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network and host of its enormously popular, long-running program, The 700 Club</p> ,<p>" had suffered a stroke in 2018.</p><p>A former Southern Baptist minister who said God had inspired him to run for president, Robertson made a strong start in his campaign for the 1988 Republican nomination, stunning better-known opponents, including Vice President George H.W. Bush, the eventual nominee, by finishing near the top in Iowa and other early contests.</p><p>Although poor showings in later primaries soon forced him to withdraw, Robertsons campaign became a political springboard. In 1989, he founded the Christian Coalition, which gave conservative Christians a voice in the nations capital and helped turn the religious right into a well-organized political movement.</p><p>He saw the possibilities, said Laura R. Olson, a Clemson University political science professor and expert on religion and politics. </p>as of 7/22<p> Pat Robertson was absolutely brilliant at taking his success from the presidential race and transforming that into a powerful interest group.</p><p>A Yale law school graduate and son of a U.S. senator, Robertson had the education, media skills and political experience to build on the foundation laid by another group with conservative Christian roots.</p><p>In 1979, the Rev. Jerry Falwell founded the Moral Majority, which rallied once-apolitical fundamentalist and evangelical Christians into an electoral force. By 1989, amid lackluster fundraising, it was disbanded and the Christian Coalition was born.</p><p>A fundamentalist preacher like Falwell, Robertson urged Christian conservatives to fight what he saw as Americas drift toward moral decay. He pointed to legalized abortion, homosexuality and AIDS, as well as government policies he saw as anti-family and anti-God.</p><p>But the approach favored by Robertson and Ralph Reed, the political activist he hired to run the Christian Coalition, was more sophisticated than the often-blistering attacks of Falwell, creating a more polished style of Christian conservatism. Robertson took what Falwell created, refined it and ensured that it continued, Olson said.</p><p>With an army of fervent followers, Robertson and his grassroots coalition promoted conservative Christian candidates and traditional values across the U.S. By 1995, the group claimed 1.6 million members in 1,600 chapters. The following year, its financial peak, it took in contributions of nearly $25 million.</p><p>Enthusiastic and informal  viewers and most others knew him simply as Pat  Robertson shot to fame in the 1970s as the host of The 700 Club, a groundbreaking religious variety show that aired daily on his Christian Broadcasting Network.</p><p>He combined evangelistic fervor with a comfortable on-air style that drew comparisons to the most popular talk show hosts of the day, including Johnny Carson and Merv Griffin.</p><p>Mixing news with music, a call-in advice segment and interviews with key religious and political figures, the 700 Club made Robertson a familiar face across the U.S. By the 1980s, the Christian Broadcasting Network, the media empire he built from his 1959 purchase of a single Virginia television station, reached about 30 million homes and grossed more than $200 million a year.</p><p>He appealed to a rising middle class among evangelicals, said John C. Green, senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. </p>true as of 7/22<p>Yet Robertson, known for his business and political acumen, also had a history of incendiary remarks that repeatedly thrust him into the headlines, particularly in his later years.</p><p>In 2005, he called on the U.S. to assassinate Venezuelas leftist president, Hugo Chavez, saying it would be a whole lot cheaper than starting a war. A few months later, he suggested that the massive stroke suffered by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was divine retribution for dividing Gods land, ceding Gaza to the Palestinians. He later apologized for the statements.</p><p>The comments, and many others, brought strong criticism  and jokes from late-night talk show hosts.</p><p>A tendency to shoot from the hip was not new for Robertson, who declared in 1992 that feminism caused women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.</p><p>He later said such comments were the result of impulsive tendencies. My passion runs ahead of me , he told ABCs Good Morning America in 2006. The problem is, I ad lib.</p><p>Marion Gordon Robertson was born March 22, 1930, in Lexington, Va., the younger of two sons in a Southern family steeped in politics and religion. He was nicknamed Pat by his older brother.</p><p>His father, Absalom Willis Robertson, served 34 years in Congress. His mother, the former Gladys Churchill Willis, was deeply religious, and later influenced her younger son to devote his life to God. Both his grandfathers were Baptist clergymen.</p><p>After high school at an elite academy in Tennessee, he graduated in 1950 with a bachelors degree in history from Virginias Washington and Lee University. He studied economics in London before joining the Marine Corps and serving two years during the Korean War, leaving with the rank of lieutenant. </p><p>In 1986, as Robertson was mulling a presidential run, former Rep. Pete McCloskey Jr. (R-San Mateo), who served in Korea and knew him there, released a letter saying Robertson had used his fathers influence to avoid combat duty. Robertson sued for libel, but later dropped the suit and agreed to pay McCloskeys court costs.</p><p>In 1955, Robertson earned a law degree from Yale, but failed the bar and never practiced. At Yale, he met Adelia Elmer, a nursing student known as Dede, and they married in 1954. They had four children, Timothy, Elizabeth, Gordon and Ann, all </p> of<p> who</p> m<p> survive him. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2022-04-20/dede-robertson-wife-of-televangelist-and-presidential-candidate-pat-robertson-dies">His wife died </a>in 2022</p> after battling cancer<p>. </p>doublecheck<p>It was during a brief business career, while he and his wife were living in New York City, that Robertson first felt what he would call a God-shaped vacuum in his life. I was so burdened with the futility of life that at one point I actually considered suicide, he wrote in Shout It From the Housetops, his 1972 autobiography.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/5a/21/222028994f7a80101b016af25370/obit-dede-roberson-56441.jpg"></figure><p>After meeting with a Baptist evangelist sent by his mother, Robertson said he had a born-again experience and rushed home to tell his stunned wife that he had been saved. He enrolled at New York Theological Seminary, earning a masters degree in divinity in 1959.</p><p>Although he was soon an ordained Southern Baptist minister  he resigned when he ran for president  Robertson embraced the charismatic movement, characterized by a personal relationship with God and a belief in faith-healing, prophesy and the ability to speak in tongues.</p><p>Through his ministry, Robertson claimed credit for healing illnesses and even diverting natural disasters. In 1986, he said on the air that the previous year, he had prayed away Hurricane Gloria, which skipped his home base of Virginia Beach, Va., but slammed into North Carolina and later Long Island.</p><p>Robertson often said God gave him personal guidance, including directing him in 1959 to buy the TV station he used to create his religious channel, the nations first. He then had the idea of asking 700 viewers to pledge $10 a month to meet the stations monthly expenses, which became the basis for the 700 Club show. He was also a pioneer in the use of satellite transmissions to cable television systems.</p><p>In 1980, concerned about a lack of wholesome programming elsewhere, he bought the rights to old TV series, including </p>W<p>westerns and family-friendly shows such as Father Knows Best, which helped expand the Christian Broadcasting Networks viewership. Its family entertainment arm was eventually spun off and in 1997, sold to Fox Kids for a reported $1.9 billion, and later to Disney.</p><p>Among his other enterprises were Regent University, a Christian </p>U<p>university in Virginia Beach with graduate programs and an accredited law school, and Operation Blessing, a global charity.</p><p>Robertson was edging toward politics by the early 1980s, focusing on national and global issues on The 700 Club. I have always thought that Christians should get involved in public life, he told the Chicago Tribune in 1985.</p><p>When he ran for president, he shared much of the agenda of other Republicans seeking the nomination. But, moved by what he saw as the nations moral decline, he went beyond what then was the standard conservative line.</p><p>He not only called for measures against abortion, but tax breaks for stable family units, in which mothers stayed home with their children. He offered ringing endorsements of school prayer, implying it would ease the problems of illiteracy and drug use. And he said landlords should be able to discriminate without criminal penalty against people with AIDS.</p><p>With strong donations and dedicated volunteers, Robertson finished second in Iowas GOP caucuses to Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, with Bush coming in third. He did well in several other states but poorly in New Hampshire and the Super Tuesday primaries. He withdrew soon afterward</p>s<p>, endorsing Bush, who went on to win the presidency.</p><p>Armed with a database of thousands of donors and supporters, he founded the Christian Coalition the next year. As the group gained political clout, Robertson was invited to the White House and Capitol Hill. In 1995, he was on the cover of U.S. News </p>and  &amp;<p> World Report for a story about the power of the religious right.</p><p>But the influence of the Christian Coalition  and Robertson  soon began to fade. Reed stepped down in 1997 and the coalition struggled with financial and other problems. In 2001, Robertson resigned too, both as president and from the coalitions board, saying he wanted to focus on other interests. By then, the organization was in debt.</p><p>Robertson continued to appear on The 700 Club into his 90s, although his son Gordon, appointed chief executive officer of CBN in 2007, became the programs primary host. Robertson retired in 2021.</p><p>By 2006, after </p> his<p> increasingly provocative statements, old allies and friends in the evangelical movement began to distance themselves. He speaks for an ever-diminishing number of American evangelicals, said Richard Land, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. </p>As of 7/22<p>But Robertson was undaunted and continued to speak out, whether it was to blame the destructive nature of storms or hurricanes on the LGBTQ community or </p> to make<p> wild predictions, such as his forecast that asteroids would soon destroy Earth. He cheered Donald Trump's election but later said he found the president "very erratic" and someone who "lives in an alternate reality."</p><p>Some analysts suggested Robertson was simply dialing up his rhetoric in an attempt to reclaim his position as the face of the religious right.</p><p>As his influence waned and the movement diversified, Olson said, maybe he was trying to insert himself back into a position of relevance.</p>Trounson is a former Times staff writer.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Leg warmers, for example, are back. </p><p>"They are clinging with white-knuckle fear to the last bit of power they have," Roma said</p> <p>of the far-right agitators, just as ultra-conservatives did the last time California tried to clear its schools of anything hinting at gender diversity. </p><p>More than 75 laws outlawing a range of gender-related issues  from talking about sexuality in classrooms to holding drag performances in public  have been passed by statehouses nationwide this year. Republican standard-bearers including Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Green</p> e<p> have made anti-LGBTQ+ hate their brand, and there is real concern that our current Supreme Court will overturn <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-gay-marriage-decision-20150626-story.html">Obergefell vs. Hodges</a>, the landmark 2015 case that legalized same sex-marriage nationwide. </p><p>Hard to believe it's 2023, especially because California has been here, done this, circa 1978 with the Briggs Initiative, also known as Proposition 6. That's when voters considered giving school boards the power to fire gay and lesbian teachers and anyone who openly supported gay rights. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative, named for then-State Sen. John Briggs, a conservative from Orange County, also pitted LBGTQ+ rights against parental rights. The initiative posited</p> <p>that allowing gay and lesbian teachers in classrooms was a danger to kids, because such educators would "recruit" students into their "lifestyles." </p><p>"I don't understand why we have to send our children to sit in front of a homosexual teacher for eight hours," this newspaper reported Briggs saying in July 1977. "We can't risk our children."</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>"Save the children" is nothing new  just a recycled attack, dusted off and freshened up for another generation and supercharged <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-07/how-qanon-has-hijacked-hollywood-movies-for-conspiracy-theories">through the QAnon conduit of social media</a> to serve the purposes of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-25/california-takes-lead-on-hate">far-right intent on undermining democracy</a> and maintaining the shaky status quo of power. Remember when we were supposed to be saving the children from the adrenochrome-drinking Democrats ritually abusing them</p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/02/16/pizzagate-qanon-capitol-attack/" target="_blank">underneath a D.C. pizza parlo</a>r?</p><p>If those who oppose diversity can't outright try to ban the humans this time, they will ban the ideas, purposefully riling up supporters by conflating inclusion with indoctrination, and "grooming" with existing. Because really, who doesn't want to save the children if the threat feels real?</p><p>Just like now, the whole Briggs mess back then emanated from</p> <p>Florida  specifically in Dade County where Anita Bryant, a pop singer better known for her role as the spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, in 1977 spearheaded a "Save the Children" campaign to repeal a law that protected gay and lesbian people from job and housing discrimination. She successfully argued that she had a right to control "the moral atmosphere in which my children grow up."</p><p>Her campaign was a backlash to a decade of expanding recognition of gay civil rights after the Stonewall riots in 1969. It sparked a national movement that Briggs picked up on, with Bryant's help. </p><p>While Bryant's campaign was successful, it fueled a fierce response from California's LGBTQ+ community. On the night Bryant's ordinance passed in Florida, politician Harvey Milk, then a young member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led a protest of thousands down Castro Street. </p><p>After the Briggs Initiative made it onto the California ballot, collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures, Milk was among its most vocal critics. In a memorable speech on the steps of San Francisco's City Hall, he spoke of the need to keep California a place of hope and acceptance. </p><p>"(T)he young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, and the Richmond, Minnesotas, who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope," Milk said. "And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right."</p><p>That's the Harvey Milk whose legacy was recently debased by board members in the Temecula Valley Unified School District, where a conservative majority refused to adopt a new social studies curriculum because Milk was mentioned in a few pages of history materials. That is what erasure means: not allowing future generations to believe in hope for the oppressed, making them feel alone and wrong. </p><p>Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Atty. Gen. </p>eral <p>Rob Bonta announced </p> that <p>they are investigating Temecula's action as a possible violation of state law. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative was ultimately defeated by more than a million votes, despite initial polling that predicted easy passage. The tipping point was when former Gov. Ronald Reagan came out against it, along with then-Gov. Jerry Brown and then-President </p>Jimmy<p> Carter.</p><p>Which brings me to Monday and Sister Roma at the Capitol. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/18/5a/76043a0a4908926752432fdee4ed/unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>I met Roma in a room full of queer leaders at a reception for Pride Month at the Capitol, where 16 LGBTQ+ activists were honored by the Senate and Assembly. Also in the room were the LGBTQ+ powerhouses of the Legislature, where more than 10% of elected officials now identify as something other than heterosexual. </p><p>It was a room you would not find in Kansas, Florida, Nebraska  or anywhere in 1978. Along with Sister Roma, resplendent in a royal blue feather headdress, those honored included tennis legends Billie Jean King and Rosemary Casals; Phil Collum, the first openly gay assistant chief of police in Chula Vista; Janessa Goldbeck, a former Marine captain running for office in San Diego, and others you perhaps have never heard of, but who are engaged in lives of service to help make this state a better place. </p><p>The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have given more than $887,000 to charities since 2000, including the St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church Fund an Immigrant Program, AIDS Housing Alliance / SF and the Bay Area Rainbow Symphony. That's</p> <p>a bit more than the $1,500 they raised at their first fundraiser in 1980 for gay Cuban refugees. The Sisters have come a long way, but never strayed from their mission: to promulgate universal joy and expiate stigmatic guilt.</p><p>"I've never come from a place of hate," said Sister Roma, whose blue eyes are kind and unflinching. </p><p>"It actually hurts" that people believe she's ridiculing anything, she told me. But "visibility without fear encourages others," and so she and her sisters will continue to do what they do. </p><p>Each of the honorees walked down the center aisles of the Senate and Assembly to receive gilt-framed resolutions honoring their work. Republicans walked out of the chamber</p> <p>both times Sister Roma received her commendation. And a few hundred protesters gathered outside, allegedly upset by the "mockery" that Sister Roma and her order represent to the Catholic Church, which, let's remember,</p> <p>is facing bankruptcies across California as the financial toll of sexual abuse lawsuits mount</p> s<p>. </p><p>But as Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), the first gay woman to hold her post, told me at the reception, there has been a "sea change" in who holds power in California and there will be no going back to 1978. </p><p>"This comes down to freedom," Atkins said. Not just protecting it, but advancing it. </p><p>Earlier in the day, on the same steps where the protest against Sister Roma took place, LGBTQ+ legislators announced they are pursuing a state constitutional amendment for the 2024 ballot that would repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California. Yes, it is still in California's Constitution despite being overturned by courts. It reads: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.</p><p>If the U.S. Supreme Court does overturn the federal right to same-sex marriage, having that nullified proposition on the books could be a problem in California. So as state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), one of the authors of the amendment, put it, "we need to be on the offensive." </p><p>Which brings to mind another quote from Milk. </p><p>"Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders," he said, "and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible."</p><p>With activists like Sister Roma and elected officials like Atkins and Wiener in office across the state, we are on the offensive. For all the hate that is out there, churned from the basest of motives and used to exploit parents, this is not Florida and it is not 1978. </p><p>In California, visibility and equality may not be perfect. But unlike leg warmers, closets are never coming back. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"I recommend it."</p><p>Her statement set up the unanimous school board approval of a resolution listing all the ways the nation's second largest school district intends to raise awareness about the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>The reading</p> <p>and vote unfolded four days after more than 100 demonstrators marched <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/parents-protest-lgbtq-pride-day-los-angeles-saticoy-elementary-school">outside Saticoy Elementary in Sun Valley</a> in protest of a gay pride assembly. Some shouted slurs at counterprotesters and fights broke out before police quickly intervened.</p><p>Goldberg's reading occurred on the same day that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">violence erupted outside the Glendale</a> Unified school board meeting  which had its own gay pride resolution on the agenda  and once again, fights broke out among demonstrators. Officers declared an unlawful assembly, briefly ordered people to shelter in place and sent protesters home.</p><p>On Tuesday at least the L.A. school board made clear they were not remaining neutral.</p><p>The resolution "proclaims and commemorates June as LGBTQ+ Pride Month, October as LGBTQ+ History Month, as well as October 11th as National Coming Out Day, November 20th as Transgender Day of Remembrance, March 31st as Transgender Day of Visibility, and April 12th as Day of Silence."</p><p>It encourages "all schools" to incorporate lessons on the LGBTQ+ community and make use of the "Queer All Year" calendar, and hold "commemorative activities" at various points throughout the school year.</p><p>Officials also recommitted to publicize the "OUT for Safe Schools" campaign by providing posters, staff badges, and other inclusive materials to schools.</p>"<p>It is a common exercise for the L.A. school district to pass feel-good resolutions with little to no opposition. But this year, in this moment, a pro-LGBTQ+ resolution feels timely and relevant, said school board member Nick Melvoin, who praised his brother and his brother's husband as the best of parents.</p><p>"This resolution has seemed a bit perfunctory over the years," Melvoin said. "We'd bring it and we'd celebrate, but we thought that it was less needed here in Los Angeles.</p><p>"But as we're seeing the weaponization of public policy to sow hate and discrimination, it makes it all the more important for us to speak out against the acts of hate and violence cropping up all around us  from legislatures across the country passing anti-LGBTQ+ bills to a cruel act of vandalism in our own backyard just a few days ago."</p><p>Melvoin was referring to the burning of a gay pride flag that belonged to a staff member at Saticoy Elementary, where the Friday demonstration had been staged. </p><p>"These kinds of incidents shake us out of our complacency," Melvoin said. </p><p>Across the nation, there are more than 490 bills restricting rights for the LGBTQ+ community this legislative session, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p><p>The resolution described a crisis to be confronted: "Youth identifying as LGBTQ+ are at a higher risk for experiencing homelessness, being victims of bullying, and attempting or dying by suicide, and national research indicates that mental health struggles and rates of suicidal thoughts have trended upward among LGBTQ+ youth in recent years."</p><p>Speakers at the meeting talked of their troubles growing up, and a couple of students said bullying of LGBTQ+ students  including in L.A. Unified  is not a thing of the past</p><p>The protesters at Saticoy had called for boycotting the school on the day of the assembly, even though attendance at the assembly was optional.</p><p>"Keep your kids home and innocent," a flier posted by protest organizers said. </p><p>Attendance was lower than usual Friday at the school, with about 69 out of 564 students absent. L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho said the vast majority of absences were over safety concerns, not in protest of the assembly.</p><p>The subject of the assembly was the book that Goldberg read aloud. The assembly also included some singing, Carvalho said.</p><p>What was presented was absolutely, absolutely grade level appropriate, conforms with standards, as published by the state of California, Carvalho said. And it aligns with this idea that books that are age appropriate should not be removed from shelves or not be accessible to kids. This was nothing more, nothing less than a book that speaks about families in our community  of different religions, races, ethnicities  and has one reference that has been misportrayed in so many ways."</p><p>Goldberg, 78, had intended to remain calm, but later in the meeting, when she spoke on the resolution, anger rose in her voice and she nearly shed tears.</p><p>She recounted her career and the personal struggles </p> of <p>her and her children, who, as the book put it, had two mommies.</p><p>She also spoke directly to the fears expressed by protesters  that schools are carrying out the sexualized "grooming" of children into a lifestyle their parents consider deviant.</p><p>The district would never condone the sexualization of students "in any way, shape, or form," she said. "And those of you who believe that this might happen are allowed to read the curriculum materials, are invited into the assemblies with your children, are invited not to have your children go to the assemblies. I do not believe in forcing a parent to have a child attend assemblies that they feel would be violating their values."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

They knew little about other benefits of their pensions  such as the ability to withdraw money early to pay for medical expenses or vocational education. </p><p>Some, like heavyweight journeyman Mike Jameson, said they had never </p>even<p> heard of the <a href="https://www.dca.ca.gov/csac/forms_pubs/publications/pension_plan.shtml" target="_blank">California Professional Boxers' Pension Plan</a>, which is paid for through a fee on ticket sales to boxing events.</p><p>"I don't want to browbeat them, but they could have done a much better job letting people know," said Jameson, a 68-year-old retired boxer from San Jose who first learned he was owed a pension from The Times. "It's great to hear they are going to do more."</p><p>Jameson applied for his benefits</p> <p>in April</p> <p>and last week</p>  (May 22) <p>received a $12,000 check.</p><p>State Assemblyman Matt Haney (D-San Francisco) said he was alarmed to read The Times' story and immediately called the athletic commission to ensure changes were made not just to the boxers pension, but also to a bill he is authoring to create a similar retirement plan for mixed martial arts fighters.</p> California created the nations only pension for aging boxers. But its failing many of them<p>Haney amended <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1136" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 1136</a> to require that the commission send annual statements informing future vested MMA fighters of their account balances. </p> The Assembly is due to vote on the bill this week and, if passed as expected, it would move to the Senate.  The Assembly unanimously approved the bill Wednesday and it now moves to the Senate.<p>"The boxers' pension is critical, but it can be improved," Haney said in an interview outside the Assembly chambers. "I hope that as we move this MMA pension bill through the process, we correct some of the challenges that exist with the boxers' pension and don't replicate them  and that we also fix it for boxers as well. We have to let folks know who qualify and we have to make sure they can access it, otherwise this isn't going to work."</p><p>The MMA bill notes that as a group, professional athletes in combat sports may end up injured, destitute and suffer "extraordinary disabilities" as a result of their profession, including "acute and traumatic brain injuries, resulting from multiple concussions as well as from repeated exposure to a large number of sub-concussive punches and kicks, eye injuries, including retinal tears, holes and detachments, and other neurological impairments."</p><p>If the bill becomes law, the commission would adopt regulations determining how many fights would be needed to become eligible for the MMA pension. Haney said he expects fighters would become vested after 12 to 14 fights in California.</p><p>California's pension for boxers was created in 1982 and provides mostly lump-sum payments to fighters who have logged at least 75 scheduled rounds in California without more than a three-year break. The amount a boxer receives is based on how many rounds they fought and the purse for those bouts. </p><p>Once a boxer turns 50 and is eligible to apply for their pension, the amount they are owed is set and does not increase.</p> <p>Retirement plan experts said that means the longer it takes a boxer to claim</p> <p>their pension, the more it diminishes in value due to inflation.</p><p>Currently, the boxers' pension pays an average of $17,000 in a </p>one-time <p>lump-sum payment to retirees, according to a Times' analysis of commission records.</p><p>The boxers pension plan began making payments to eligible boxers in 1999 and, to date, has provided 235 retired fighters a total of $4 million. Most of that has been paid in the last decade. However, an additional 200 boxers are owed pensions and have not claimed them. </p><p>"They never said anything about it when I was a pro," said welterweight Mike Dallas Jr., 36, of Bakersfield, who retired</p> <p>from boxing in 2020.</p> California created a pension for boxers but says it struggled to find them. So we did<p>That left him unsure if he qualified for a pension.</p> <p>The commission verified to The Times that Dallas has a pension, which he can claim when he turns 50.</p><p>Dallas learned from a Times reporter that the</p> <p>plan allows boxers as young as 36 to withdraw all or some of the money they've accrued to pay for vocational education. </p><p>"I could have used that when I was going to trucking school," Dallas said.</p><p>He said he recently learned</p> <p>his father, Mike Dallas Sr., is owed nearly $13,000 in benefits. Dallas Sr., who fought as a lightweight, died in 2012 from </p> leukemia cancer <p>at 45. Dallas Jr. said his dad likely never knew he had a pension, which was eligible to be paid to his family immediately after his death.</p><p> "I never knew about it, nobody did, not my dad, not anyone," said Dallas Jr., who plans to file a claim for his father's pension. </p><p>Retirement planning experts said a pension plan structured like Californias should mail annual statements as soon as a person is vested to ensure recipients know about their benefits and can plan for their future. It also ensures the plan has regular contact with its beneficiaries.</p><p>However, the athletic commission has waited until a boxer turns 50 before attempting to contact them for the first time. By then, the vast majority of addresses on file are decades old. </p><p>In response to The Times' story, the commission will begin sending statements when a boxer first meets minimum requirements for a future pension and then every year thereafter. That change is expected to begin early next year, said the commission's executive officer, Andy Foster.</p><p>The agency is also now using the Department of Consumer Affairs'<a href="https://www.dca.ca.gov/enforcement/index.shtml" target="_blank"> Division of Investigation </a>to obtain up-to-date contact information for boxers with unclaimed pensions, said Foster, who also plans to hire a private investigator to locate additional fighters. </p> Could you have a California boxers pension? Here is what you need to know<p>The commission is in the process of posting a new licensing application that includes a pension acknowledgment form that boxers sign as a way of ensuring new fighters know they are automatically enrolled in the plan.</p><p>Over the past decade, the commission has, on average, paid 15 boxers each year. So far this year, the commission said it has sent pension checks to 10 boxers. Another three will be paid once the commission transfers funds to pay them, while four others are in the process of filing paperwork. </p><p>The Times spoke to several others who said they plan to file for their newly discovered pensions in the coming weeks.</p><p>Foster said he has set a goal of providing benefits to 50 boxers this year  which would double the number of boxers </p>ever <p>paid in a single year, according to commission records analyzed by The Times.</p><p>"I'm just trying to get people paid," Foster said. "If they are owed money, get them paid."</p><p>The pension plan, however, has a rocky history of generating adequate revenue and it does not have enough money to pay all of the boxers who can claim a pension now without reducing what others receive in the future.</p><p>The plan set aside only 14% of the $2.1 million needed to pay boxers with late claims  which includes those who have not filed for their pension before turning 54.</p> Former boxer Alex Ramos faces hardship, but a lifeline is out of reach <p>If the commission has more late claims than funds available, it would reduce the amount of money in the accounts of fighters who are not yet 50.</p><p>Foster downplayed the impact of a large number of boxers applying for their pensions at once.</p><p>"If you're in your 30s and you're vested, you may see some decline," Foster said. "It might happen, but the market will probably go up and they will see it back."</p><p>The commission is looking at additional revenue sources for the boxers pension and is planning to raise its 88-cent ticket fee to $1 in the coming months, Foster said.</p><p>The MMA pension bill calls for that plan to be funded with a ticket fee  expected to be set at $1  at those events and souvenir sales. At its board meeting next week, the commission will discuss a plan to pursue additional funding for both pensions by creating a specialty license plate, which has generated millions for other state programs.</p><p>Haney, the lawmaker carrying the MMA pension bill, said he would like to see the boxers' and MMA pension plans provide an annual check that can better aid fighters in retirement.</p><p>"Many of these [MMA] fighters would qualify for it 20, 30 years from now, so we have some time to get this right," Haney said. "In the case of the boxers' [plan], we have to fix the flaws."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Blood crusted around her nostrils and mouth. She was so dazed that she didnt notice a telephone cord wrapped around her neck.</p><p>She was a social worker with the <a href="https://dcfs.lacounty.gov/">Department of Children and Family Services</a> who said a 16-year-old foster boy battered and sexually assaulted her in one of the hotels guest rooms.</p><p>The boy was one of hundreds of foster youths who Los Angeles Countys child welfare agency has placed in rented hotel rooms because it has no foster homes for them, according to reporting by the <a href="https://journalism.berkeley.edu/programs/mj/investigative-reporting/">Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkeley</a> and The Times that included dozens of interviews as well as county records obtained under the California Public Records Act.</p><p>The alleged attack  as well as another on a social worker by a foster youth at a different hotel weeks later  has sparked criticism from those within the agency who say that such violence was inevitable.</p><p>One high-level DCFS administrator wrote to Supervisor Janice Hahn earlier this year to tell her that the situation was a crisis and totally out of control.</p><p>The children placed in the hotels are usually among those with some of the most significant untreated trauma and the gravest histories of violence.</p><p>Though group homes frequently have security and teams of staff members, children in the hotels have often been supervised by a single social worker, sometimes with scant knowledge of their backgrounds, little training to de-escalate potential violence and no on-site colleagues when things go wrong, according to DCFS policy documents and interviews with staff.</p><p>State law prohibits housing foster children for extended periods in places like the Biltmore that are not licensed to provide foster care. Over the years, state and county child welfare authorities have repeatedly promised to halt the practice of warehousing youths in unlicensed places that are unable to meet abused and neglected childrens need for safety, education and mental health services  yet its happening again.</p><p>The reason this time, according to government data and experts throughout the system, is the states most severe shortage of licensed foster homes in memory.</p><p>In 2015, then-Gov. Jerry Brown responded to complaints of substandard care in group foster homes by signing landmark legislation to move thousands of foster youths out of group facilities and into new foster family homes. The group homes now house a fraction of the youths they once did, but the additional foster parents to take them in have not materialized.</p><p>Until a solution is reached, DCFS Director Brandon Nichols said, the Biltmore is the last resort for social workers who can now find no other place for children experiencing some of the most vexing problems with drugs, sex trafficking, violence and mental health disorders.</p><p>It is just an emergency and better than a kid sleeping on the street that night, Nichols said.</p><p>His agency has 18,000 foster youths but fewer licensed beds. Licensed foster parents and group homes also have the right to reject any foster child before or after their arrival. In dire circumstances, social workers sometimes look for beds in homeless shelters, but those are scarce. The only places willing to accept anyone without exception are the unlicensed hotel rooms.</p><p>We didnt quite anticipate how difficult this was going to be, Nichols said.</p> BREAK<p>When the Biltmore opened, it was the largest hotel west of Chicago, covering half a city block. All those rooms were a big liability at the onset of the pandemic in 2020.</p><p>In December 2021, Bobby Cagle, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-25/l-a-county-dcfs-again-at-crossroads-as-another-director-departs-amid-child-deaths">then the director</a> of Los Angeles Countys child welfare agency, quietly struck a deal with the Biltmores operators to house foster youths and their social workers at the cost of $89 a night. The contract codified a practice of using hotel rooms to place foster children that had begun in late 2020. DCFS also has housed foster children at a Comfort Inn in Pomona and a Holiday Inn in Lancaster.</p><p>Since January 2022, the agency has placed at least 220 foster youths in hotels. Some stays were only a few days, while others lasted months.</p><p>The county social worker who reported being injured at the Biltmore said she rarely interacted with youths in her usual job, so she offered to occasionally staff the hotel. The Times is withholding her identity at her request because she is a victim of an alleged sexual assault.</p><p>Initially, she said, she found the hotel stunning. There were always tourists milling around the lobby. One time, she spotted a famous boxer. Another time, a crowd of costumed guests were attending nearby Comic Con.</p><p>Its a really nice hotel, she said. The feeling is beautiful.</p><p>The once-exclusive hotel possesses a rich history as a venue for the Academy Awards in the 1930s and 40s, where Bette Davis and Jimmy Stewart received Oscars. They were surrounded by murals and frescoes by Giovanni Smeraldi, whose work also adorned the White House and the Vatican.</p><p>The suites were once used by President Kennedy, the Beatles and Al Capone. Hotel advertising still promises guests a five-star experience with classic elegance steeped in Hollywood glamour. The hotel bar was designed in the style of Spains royal hall where Queen Isabella first heard of Columbus discovery of America.</p><p>Until the January incident, the social worker said, none of the guests seemed aware there were foster children in the rooms next to them. She wasnt sure how much the hotel staff knew. The youths were not allowed to order room service, she said. (The Biltmore declined to comment, referring questions to DCFS.)</p><p>Social workers were responsible for monitoring the children coming and going from the rooms and holding on to the hotel room keys. Foster youths would have to knock on the supervisors door when they returned to the hotel so they could get swiped into their room.</p><p>The social worker was sometimes paired with another who would stay with her in a room across the hall from a foster youth, but she was the only one on duty in January when she was assigned to look after the 16-year-old boy.</p><p>I didnt question it because I didnt hear of any stories of him being physically assaultive with anybody, said the social worker, who did not reveal any identifying information about the boy.</p><p>In reality, according to sources familiar with the boys history, he had been placed under psychiatric holds more than 20 times because authorities deemed him a physical threat to himself or others. The Times is withholding his name because he is a minor.</p><p>On Jan. 16, the boy awoke agitated after misplacing his video game controller, according to the social worker. She said she took him to breakfast and boxed his leftovers to bring back to her room while he left to attend a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade.</p><p>Hours later, she said, the boy burst into her room, falsely accusing her of stealing $600 while he was away.</p><p>He started yelling, You have my stuff! she said.</p><p>The social worker said the boy began pushing her. She phoned her supervisor, who agreed to call the police. The social worker then tried to use the hotel phone to call down to the lobby, but she said the boy disconnected the receiver from the phone and later tied it around her neck.</p><p>For the next 40 minutes or so, the social worker said, the teenager assaulted her physically and sexually. She said the youth groped her over her clothes and smothered her face with a towel.</p><p>I thought somebody was going to save me, she said, but they didnt.</p><p>She said she escaped the room by promising to go get him money at an ATM. The two of them went down to the hotel lobby, where she waved down hotel staff.</p><p>The social worker shared photos with The Times taken a few days after the incident that show dark purple bruising around her eyes and yellowing bruises on her arms and legs.</p><p>She partly blamed DCFS for failing to warn her that the teenager she was supervising could be violent, leaving her vulnerable to an attack. But she said shes also concerned about the larger child welfare system, which leaves nowhere to safely send youths with severe mental health needs who do not get placed in foster homes.</p><p>They close the group homes, so we dont have placements, she said. The idea was everybody should be in a foster home, but not all the kids can function in a foster home.</p><p>Weeks after the alleged attack, Timothy Varvais, an assistant regional administrator based in the DCFS Lakewood office, wrote to Hahn, the county supervisor who represents the area.</p><p>Varvais wrote that he had just struggled to place another 16-year-old boy who was gang affiliated, [had a] mental health diagnosis, uses drugs and has violent tendencies. He boasts of killing animals and tells social workers about a recent incident in which he raped a young lady. He has no remorse and doesnt want any help.</p><p>The challenge was to find him a place to live after his foster mother said he was no longer welcome in her home, but no licensed home would take him and even the agencys emergency shelters were full. The only choice at 4 p.m. was to get a hotel room for the boy and station social workers nearby.</p><p>This is an impossible task, Varvais wrote. Often staff have already worked a full day and now  I am asking them to work all night to watch a child. The risk to our staff is tremendous.</p><p>Hahn</p> 's office did not respond to a request for comment. The, the<p> other members of the Board of Supervisors </p> did not respond or and Varvais <p>declined to be interviewed. </p> Varvais did not respond to requests.<p>Three days after Varvais sent the letter, the department suffered another incident at a hotel sometimes used as an alternative to the Biltmore.</p><p>A minor in foster care allegedly physically assaulted a social worker who was supervising him at a Lancaster hotel, said DCFS spokeswoman Shiara Davila-Morales, who declined to identify the hotel or detail the social workers injuries.</p><p>Sources familiar with the youth alleged to have been involved said he suffers developmental disabilities that require a much higher level of care than the social worker at the hotel could provide.</p><p>Police arrested the boys suspected in both hotel incidents, and prosecutors charged them under the juvenile delinquency code. The proceedings are confidential because of their ages. The boys declined interview requests submitted via their attorneys.</p><p>When the county previously used unlicensed facilities to house foster children, state authorities stopped the practice. Gov. Gavin Newsoms political appointees have so far declined to do the same with the hotel stays. Newsom and his social services secretary, Kim Johnson, declined interview requests.</p><p>Nichols, the DCFS director, said the county has little choice but to use the hotels until it gains a licensed foster care site that wont reject children.</p><p>Such a facility would require approval in Sacramento that lawmakers have been reluctant to grant out of fear that it might undermine the push to get children out of group homes and into family homes.</p><p>The one psychiatric facility that state lawmakers have approved for Los Angeles County would be able to reject particular children and is far from completed. Nichols noted that lawmakers gave regulators two years to develop licensing requirements before an operator could even apply for final approval. Im saying, Hey, guys, is there any way we can speed that up, he said.</p><p>Nichols said he is also organizing specialized mobile teams that can travel to group homes, shelters and hotels to help stabilize children suffering from the most difficult behaviors. As a result of the past incidents, the agency now requires at least two caseworkers for every foster child in hotels, as well as security guards nearby, he said.</p><p>Until we develop a better solution  were still relying on hotels, Nichols said. Theyre not going to go away immediately, but I think we need to use them better.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It identified flaws in how campuses collect data, widespread distrust by students and employees in how wrongdoing is addressed and a low number of investigations  a majority of which never result in a formal resolution.</p> The presentation, however, included no specific data on the investigation numbers. <p>The report was ordered by the trustees last year after the resignation of the previous chancellor</p> ,<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-02-17/csu-chancellor-resigns">Joseph I. Castro</a>, who was swept up in a controversy over his handling of sexual harassment and retaliation reports against a top administrator when he was president of Fresno State.</p><p>Since then, Times investigations have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-05-13/four-men-at-csu-campuses-were-accused-of-sexual-harassment-all-were-treated-differently">found inconsistencies</a> in the way reports of sexual misconduct are handled by officials across the 23-campus system and detailed how reports of wrongdoing against top administrators <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-21/csu-didnt-investigate-claims-that-a-president-inappropriately-touched-students">were not investigated</a> by school officials and senior administrators in the chancellor's office in Long Beach. </p><p>The Cal State system's interim chancellor</p> , <p><a href="https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/about-the-csu/leadership/Chancellors-Council/Pages/koester.aspx" target="_blank">Jolene Koester</a></p> ,<p> acknowledged after the Cozen O'Connor findings were presented that the system has "fallen short" in </p> its response <p>to reports of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct and retaliation.</p><p>"Many of these report findings are difficult to hear," she said, adding that addressing the problems "is going to be uncomfortable."</p><p>Cozen O' Connor said it visited each of the campuses and received survey feedback from nearly 18,000 students, staff, administrators and faculty across the Cal State system.</p><p>A final version of the report, along with findings for each campus, will be released in June. The recommendations presented to the trustees include a sweeping change in the role of the chancellor's office to</p>  better <p>spot trends and breakdowns in data collection. The report also called for creating a pool of trained investigators </p> to assist campus personnel<p>, who are often overwhelmed by multiple duties and not capable of thoroughly investigating cases. </p>   "In recent years, the examples of unprofessional, at least, and criminal, at most, behavior ... that have come to us have been shocking," said Lt. Gov. and ex-officio CSU trustee Eleni Kounalakis. "If we take this report today, and we continue to get failures  that, to me, is unacceptable." <p>A top concern was how campuses collect data on sexual harassment and sexual misconduct that</p> <p>are used to create annual public reports.</p><p>"We saw incredibly disjointed and frankly unreliable conclusions," Gina Maisto Smith, one of the attorneys who led the review, </p> said <p>of campus reports.</p>   CSU has so far paid more than $477,000 to  <p><a href="https://www.cozen.com/">         Cozen O'Connor     </a></p>    for work at 10 campuses and the chancellor's office. Kathyrn <p>Kathryn Forbes, </p> a<p> professor of women, gender and sexuality studies at Fresno State, said </p> Wednesday<p> that the presentation failed to address the role of the CSU general counsel's office in providing input on misconduct cases and did not provide data on low investigation rates at campuses.</p><p>We need comparative data. Cozen O'Connor did not offer any, said Forbes, who participated in systemwide meetings with the law firm.</p><p>A Times analysis of CSU records</p> <p>found that officials completed investigations for about 3% of more than 2,600 reports of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct received last year across the 23-campus network for the 2021-22 school year. The reports are made under Title IX, a federal law prohibiting sex discrimination. </p><p>CSU records show some cases were informally resolved before an investigation by way of educational training, suspensions, terminations and expulsions. In hundreds of instances, students and employees opted for assistance outside an investigation  such as referrals for a victims advocate or counselor.</p><p>Some campuses told The Times that the data did not accurately reflect the number of investigations. The chancellors office said that a handful of campuses reported additional data that created inconsistencies.</p> The data "do not reflect pending investigations, <p>or capture less formal inquiries conducted by the campus Title IX office that do not require an investigation,</p> " CSU spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith said.<p>The Times analysis of campus records found that</p>  i<p>n more than 1,000 instances, the alleged victims in misconduct reports did not respond to subsequent outreach. </p>   In those cases, the records did not detail attempts to contact people before concluding that a student or employee did not want to move     forward with an investigation or require other help. <p>In recent interviews with The Times, students, alumni and current and former employees expressed distrust in their campus ability to protect them from retaliation or damage to their reputation. </p><p>Those who did comply with an investigation were not always satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>Melanie Mendoza Gasca, 20, a Cal State L</p> .<p>A</p> .<p> student majoring in English, said The Times' findings on misconduct investigations were disturbing.</p><p>"I just cant believe that this is the reality of our justice system in our schools," said Gasca</p> , who filed a sexual misconduct case but declined to discuss it because campus officials told her it was confidential. "It has to change. This is unacceptable."                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

If I made any contact with the student, it was only to show support.</p><p>The other report alleged that Virjee attempted multiple times to force himself upon a student at the <a href="https://www.fullerton.edu/aarc/" target="_blank">African American Resource Center</a>. </p>She The student <p>verbally declined to engage in a hug and even indicated with her hands that she did not want to be touched, according to the report.</p><p>Virjee, according to the report, ignored her signals and verbal rejections and still engaged in physical contact with her.</p><p>The report listed the names of three women as witnesses to the incident at the African American Resource Center.</p><p>Virjee said three students were in the center when he arrived with Medina and others as part of the campus tour.</p><p>Two of them knew me and greeted me with a friendly hug, Virjee said, adding that the third student asked if she didnt also deserve a hug.</p><p>He said he hugged her and saw her again as the group left the center.</p><p>Feeling bad that I had not acknowledged her at the outset in the first greeting, I offered her a hug goodbye, Virjee said. She teased back something to the effect of Not on your life. We then exchanged a quick hug, and I left with the group.</p><p>Virjee said his interactions with the students in both centers took place in a matter of moments and that "it was never my intention to make anybody feel uncomfortable."</p><p>Medina told The Times that he did not witness anything inappropriate during the tour.</p><p>Without interviewing any witnesses, the Title IX officer questioned the credibility of the 2021 reports, which alleged misconduct in public places while Virjee was giving the tour. No other individuals came forward to report misconduct during the tour, the statement said. System officials said the Title IX officer determined that for all three reports, "even if true, the reported conduct would not be considered severe or pervasive, as defined in CSU policy."</p><p>CSU officials said Bauer, the </p>campus'<p> Title IX officer, declined to comment for this </p> report.story.<p>A </p>CSU<p> spokesperson said the university system's policy requires reaching out to students to offer support "and empower</p> [ing]<p> individuals to pursue complaints without depriving them of agency to determine how they would like to proceed."</p><p>Under </p> CSU's the university <p><a href="https://www.calstate.edu/titleix/Pages/policies.aspx" target="_blank">system's policy</a>, </p>CSU<p> officials could have launched an investigation based on factors such as a power imbalance between </p> the person accused and the accuser the person accused of wrongdoing and the potential victim <p>and whether there have been multiple or prior reports of misconduct against the same person.</p><p>Title IX experts who reviewed the reports at the request of The Times said Cal State Fullertons handling of the allegations was problematic in at least two </p>key<p> respects. The accusations </p>involved students alleging wrongdoing against the president and<p> should have been forwarded promptly to the chancellors office to avoid campus employees having to decide how to deal with accusations against the </p> university's top official, and official who runs the universitythey said. Andthe<p> CSU should have launched an investigation to determine the veracity of the claims, especially given the similarity of the three reports, </p> the experts said<p>.</p><p>Castro, who was CSU chancellor when the 2021 reports were made, said he was not told about them.</p><p>I should have been informed, Castro told The Times, adding that he would have immediately gone to the Board of Trustees with a recommendation to investigate the complaints and to place the president on leave while the investigation was completed.</p><p>The fear of </p>uncertainty and potential <p>blowback from accusing a powerful campus figure of wrongdoing can stop people from requesting an investigation.</p> For example, a<p>fter accusations of sexual harassment were </p> made reported<p> against the husband of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-13/csu-provost-reported-harassment-against-presidents-husband-then-faced-retaliation-records-say">Sonoma States former president</a>, </p>for example, <p>one </p> accuser womanwho alleged she was harassed told The Times last year that she <p>declined to go forward with an investigation because she feared retaliation, </p> she told The Times last year<p>.</p><p>The accusations were brought forward by </p>top <p>campus officials on behalf of several women and were reported directly to the chancellors office. A systemwide coordinator spoke to the women but did not formally investigate.</p><p>In a background interview last year, a </p>top<p> CSU administrator explained that the Sonoma State accusations were handled by the chancellors office because we're not going to have the campus Title IX coordinator investigate allegations against the president or the president's spouse."</p><p>In response to the complaints, Castro </p>later<p> barred the husband from visiting the campus, according to a letter from the chancellors office.</p><p>In the </p>case of Cal State <p>Fullerton </p> case<p>, experts said, CSU officials </p> from <p>outside </p>of<p> the campus should have reviewed the reports and determined how to respond.</p><p>"Even if ... it doesn't arise to a Title IX violation, that doesn't mean they can't take other actions, said <a href="https://nwlc.org/staff/shiwali-patel/" target="_blank">Shiwali Patel</a>, director of justice for student survivors and senior counsel for the National Womens Law Center.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Then she waited in line to order, avoiding my gaze.</p><p>A few minutes later, smiling slightly and holding a latte, she walked over. I stood and pulled out the chair  a gesture she seemed to appreciate. She sat down with a dignified manner, back straight, and regarded </p>at<p> me with her head slightly tilted.</p><p>I tried to act nonchalant</p>ly<p> as we moved through the basics.</p><p>Jane: A professor. From Beijing originally. Passionate about dance.</p><p>Me: Lawyer at a tech company. Born in Berkeley. Addicted to writing.</p><p>Both: Recently divorced. Kids off to college soon. Open to meeting someone.</p><p>Jane told me her ex-husband had taken the dogs when he moved out, and she liked not having a dog in the house. What about you? Do you have pets?</p><p>Two dogs, very small, I said, hoping this wasnt a deal-killer. Well managed. (Months later, Jane would recall this snippet of conversation as she pointed </p> accusingly<p> toward a wet spot on the carpet. But I digress.)</p><p>An hour passed in effortless conversation. Occasionally Jane would ask a screening question, some of them quite blunt. Is your divorce final? Do you own a home? Are you seeing anyone? Are you gay?</p><p>She ended the impromptu date by giving me her phone number. I enjoyed meeting you, she said. Lets be friends and see where this goes.</p><p>I spoke without thinking. Jane, Im not your friend. Im your future.</p><p>Back at my office, I recounted this moment with Jane to Kathryn, a colleague who was advising me on re</p>-<p>entering the dating world. When she heard what Id said, she shook her head in dismay. You can write this one off.</p><p>But the next day, Jane took my call. The following week we met for lunch. A few days later, she allowed me to drive her to a bistro in Laguna Beach.</p><p>Over a glass of wine, Jane broke the news that soon she and her teenage daughter would be leaving for a monthlong trip to China to visit Janes mom. I complained that by the time she got back, we wouldnt even remember each other.</p><p>Jane, trying to be polite, suggested I fly to China and meet up with them for a few days. Back home, I bought the plane ticket before she could change her mind.</p><p>Thats how I ended up at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, boarding a flight from L.A. to Beijing to spend nine days traveling with Jane, her teenage daughter Huiyi, and her 78-year-old mom.</p><p>On the 12-hour flight, I fretted: What if Jane has second thoughts? What if her mom disapproves? What if Huiyi hates me?</p><p>After an awkward meetup in Beijing, the four of us flew to Guilin for a sightseeing trip on the Li River. Then we were off to Shanghai, where we had dinner at a restaurant overlooking the Bund.</p><p>Along the way</p> ,<p> I got to know Jane in the context of three generations of women. Instead of feeling chaperoned, I felt privileged.</p><p>Janes mom, barely </p> 5five<p> feet tall, strode through hotel lobbies with her shoulders back and head high. At restaurants, she attacked her food rather than savored it.</p><p>A retired surgeon and OB-GYN, she told me (translated by Jane) that shed delivered at least a thousand babies and performed every manner of thoracic surgery.</p><p>It was the time of Mao, she said. We did what needed to be done.</p><p>Huiyi, whod been born in China but seemed like a SoCal native, planned to follow in the footsteps of her lao lao (maternal grandmother). </p><p>Huiyi already had the levelheaded aura of a doctor, but she looked askance whenever her mom and I held hands and flirted. Do you have to be like that?</p><p>Im pretty sure Huiyi was texting eyeroll emojis to her friends.</p><p>When the three generations of women chatted in Mandarin, I imagined cartoon-bubble dialogue above their heads. Where did you get this idiot? At least he paid for lunch.</p><p>Near the end of the trip, Jane got a call from her </p> r<p>eal</p>tor<p> estate agent in </p> Orange CountyO.C<p>. The house in Laguna Niguel that she owned with her ex-husband had received a full-price offer. Jane and Huiyi would need to find a new place to live.</p><p>Again I spoke without thinking. How about if we all move in together?</p><p>When my eldest son, Jonathan, heard about this, he was appalled. There you go, dad. But a few weeks later</p> ,<p> my cell</p> <p>phone rang.</p><p>I need to tell you something, said Jonathan. Everyone in the family likes Jane. Were not sure what she sees in you  but dont mess it up. You got lucky.</p><p>Thanks, son&nbsp; I think.</p><p>Six months to the day after meeting at a Starbucks, Jane and I posed for nuptial photos by the fountain outside the county clerks office in Laguna Hills.</p><p>Huiyi attends UC</p>I<p> Irvine now but often comes home to visit. She seems to tolerate me and Jane, but I think she still texts eyeroll emojis to her friends.</p>The author is an in-house attorney at a tech company in Irvine and writes about true crime.

I had just finished watching The Bear, the Hulu show that undoubtedly resonates with chefs but simultaneously must pain the women who love or loved them. </p><p>With a tearful smile, I excused myself to the backyard where I la</p> yid<p> in the grass and let the unseasonably humid Valley weather transport me to another time in my life.</p><p>I was a grad student in psychology. The guy I started seeing was a French-trained chef. We were doomed from the start, and our mutual masochistic ways should have been the first clue. We were two workaholics with a shared love for tragedy. With music, books, art, we always leaned toward anguish. In my mind, we were Michelin-star-crossed lovers in fair Los Angeles. We were Romeo from the South Bay and Juliet from the Valley.</p><p>We met as most modern couples do  on an app. After the standard surface-level exchanges, we started to talk on the phone. Hours rolled by as our deeply meaningful conversations around beliefs, experiences, hopes and dreams effortlessly continued. Punctuated by flirtatious overtures and prolonged good nights, we planned for our adventures together while watching Anthony Bourdain episodes across the 405 Freeway from </p>one an each<p> other.</p><p>The cadence of his voice as he inhaled and exhaled cigarette smoke became a familiar and comforting pause.</p><p>After a brief phone affair, we met in person over pasta and wine in Brentwood followed by gin and tonics at my apartment in Westwood.</p><p>I had suggested a delightful but less-than-cool family</p> -<p>owned Italian restaurant as a covert litmus test of snobbery. He passed with flying breadsticks, and we talked endlessly about the value of tradition in food.</p><p>He wanted to open a Southeast Asian fine-dining restaurant as a love letter to his family and an eff-you to those people who viewed Asian food as a hangover cure.</p><p>I loved listening to him muse about his plans. He spoke with intense passion backed up by encyclopedic knowledge. I found his diatribes familiar in the ways previous flings with med students had been  expert and passionate. However, unlike those interactions, he valued my opinion and experience related to his world as well as my own.</p><p>We were equally punch</p> -<p>drunk by each others intellect.</p><p>We fell in love instantly, but those feelings arrived with a heaping dose of existential dread for me and reactive self-medication for him. My life trajectory was stable and plotted. His was unreliable and in constant motion.</p><p>I felt stuck in my identity and plan. He offered an unpredictable and exciting alternative. We would regularly dream about moving to Uruguay and opening a bookshop and bar by the beach. Sometimes I would forget that my own goals included a house, marriage and children.</p><p>His did not. "The smartest thing I could do would be to marry you ..." Those were often his parting words as we drifted off to sleep together.</p><p>However, our Edenic ecosystem was unsustainable and exclusive by design. We rarely socialized with friends or family, and if we did, there was a countdown until we could be home together.</p><p>Our weekend afternoons felt like a clich, with me in his old band shirts and him smoking Marlboro Reds on my balcony. We enjoyed martinis at the bar of Musso &amp; Frank, tipsy walks to Whole Foods and endless strolls around the Last Bookstore. We enjoyed cooking in my tiny kitchen after a punk-soundtrack</p> ed<p> drive to </p> Nijiya Market<p>.</p><p>The high of our bubble evolved into bliss mixed with expressions of self-destruction and addiction. He had no concept of too much in any aspect of his life. He lived in excess.</p><p>I was close enough to taste the liquor on his mouth but emotionally always kept at an arm's length from his self-medicated inner darkness. He disregarded my expertise and ability to understand trauma. I think it hurt too much to believe that someone could actually know him.</p><p>The tattooed-addicted-transient-chef trope became a reality that stood in direct opposition to the regimented stillness of my life in medicine. We began to crumble in our own way. I felt </p>parentified and <p>exploited and like a parent. He felt badgered and controlled. Neither of us was wrong in our assessments of the other.</p><p>I sat on the couch at a friend's house on a warm night, waiting for the "Home, come over" text from him. It never arrived but </p>instead <p>the following did: "I don't love you, I never did. Don't write back. Forget me."</p><p>I made my friend read it because I couldn't comprehend the words. The text read like it was written in a foreign language  a message sent from an inner demon.</p><p>My calls to him went to voicemail. I was blocked. The love high turned into the most excruciating detox in the blink of an eye. For weeks, I felt psychosomatic sucker punches every time I thought of him.</p><p>He was detoxing  a fact I didn't find out </p>about <p>for many years. That crushing blow of a text was sent from the steps of an inpatient treatment facility that he was too embarrassed to tell me about.</p><p>Then one day</p> ,<p> several years after receiving his text, I got an email from him</p> :.<p> "I'm sorry."</p><p>He wrote about making amends and his accomplishments over the decade since our abrupt separation. I responded with a forgiving tone, telling him that I had met my life goals of being marri</p> edage<p> and having a home and a child.</p><p>He wrote back with a predictable but heartbreaking response: "The smartest thing I could have done would have been to marry you."</p>The author is a therapist in private practice.

      <description>I’m not the type of Angeleno who embraces being alone. Don’t get me wrong — I really like me. However, I am much more comfortable being part of a “we.”</description>

My divorce after a long marriage was heartbreaking and painful. A job transition was taking longer than I had thought</p> it would<p>, causing financial concerns, and </p>my <p>loneliness and </p>the <p>stress were taking their toll on me.</p><p>Im </p> not <p>the type of person who </p>doesnt <p>embrace</p> s<p> being alone. Don't get me wrong </p>  .<p> I really like me</p> . B<p>ut I am more comfortable being part of a we. I found myself looking for love in all the wrong places in L.A.</p><p>I had been dating endlessly with no game plan. I thought that was what I was supposed to do. (Everyone I knew told me so.) This style of dating was a frustrating landscape that I didn't belong in, and the more I went out in the Valley, the more I disliked dating.</p><p>I had even dated a few women on the Westside but found them to be less my type. Therefore, I stuck to the Valley and met most of my dates at the Local Peasant in Sherman Oaks or the Surly Goat in Encino.</p><p>As a solution to my dating challenges, I reconnected with someone from my past, thinking that she was my destiny and that, with the right amount of time, destiny would prevail. Boy, I was wrong.</p><p>So I stopped looking.</p><p>I was out with my daughter late one night when I received a text from an old friend I hadn't spoken to in a while. She also sent me a picture of a longtime friend of hers, explaining that the woman was newly single</p> as well<p>. My friend wanted to know if I was interested in meeting her friend.</p><p>I remember the picture well. The woman in the photo was beautiful, with long strawberry blond</p>e<p> hair, an amazing smile and just a </p>little <p>hint of sass.</p><p>After pressing my friend for details, I took the womans number. I wasnt sure if I was supposed to wait a few days to call her. I didnt want to seem desperate.</p><p>I decided to text her before reaching out with a phone call. After a few texts back and forth, she agreed to the call, and we talked on a Sunday evening. I liked her immediately. She was smart, funny, direct and totally adorable. We made plans to get together for brunch the following week.</p><p>This was my first-ever daytime date. It was a spring-like 75 degrees in Los Angeles (in February!), and I decided to go casual and wear my usual uniform of shorts, a T-shirt and flip-flops. I was determined to be me. I figured this woman wasnt likely going to be a long-term thing anyway.</p><p>Again, I was wrong. She walked into Hamptons 818 in Sherman Oaks and she was beautiful, vibrant and hot! I was worried that some people might think I was her father (shes 12 years my junior) and that she would get carded for the bottomless mimosas we ordered.</p><p>We settled into the date and started a meaningful conversation. She was damaged, also the victim of a recent divorce, and she was finding her way. However, she was filled with life, bursting at the seams with thoughts and ideas about things she wanted to do, see and experience. I loved her energy and intelligence, her zest for living life to its fullest. I noticed that when I talked, she listened  I mean </p>actually <p>listened. She heard me and took genuine interest in what I was saying.</p> As we parted ways after the date,<p> we left things with a simple hug and nothing more (I am, of course, a gentleman), but we did make plans to be in touch again.</p><p>After our successful second date, I texted her that I wanted to see her again. Her response was: "I am not looking for a relationship.</p><p>I quickly replied that I wasnt either, so there was no problem. (I was lying!)</p><p>I dug her and wanted her to be mine. As weeks and months went on, we spent plenty of time together and began getting closer. Our physical chemistry was immediate and magnetic, and dare I say spectacular.</p><p>However, I</p>my heart<p> was still lost, stuck in the past and not open to her. I liked her but I wasn't able to give her the fullness of my heart that she deserved. I saw her as a placeholder, a bridge to someone else and the love I was looking for.</p><p>I broke things off with her a couple of times, determined to find that love and move my life forward.</p><p>After the last of the brief break</p>-<p>ups, I decided to open </p>up <p>my heart to her and make her my priority. I wanted to give her all that she deserved.</p><p>I wasn't afraid of expressing my feelings, which she wasnt used to  at all. My expressiveness initially freaked her out, but she has adapted and forced herself to be more open and vulnerable. We now have a deeper love for each other.</p><p>We laugh together  and sometimes at each other. She is overflowing with love, and I think it surprises her. She has taught me to take things as they come and live life to its fullest. She has made me a better man. We moved in together a little over a year ago.</p><p>My Yael is my angel. Yes, I said her name. I want the world to know how much I love this woman and how she saved me. She also puts up with my mood swings and emotional expressions of my love (she calls them cheesy). Now this angel will become my wife on May 28, and I couldnt be happier. </p><p>As Ive learned, sometimes when you think you are looking for love in all the wrong places, you just need to open your eyes a bit wider. It may be right in front of you.</p>The author is an executive recruiter and the dad of his two amazing daughters. He lives in Sherman Oaks.

They blamed my credit report at Equifax. At first, Equifax could not even find my report. I had to send paperwork to verify that I even exist. It turned out that my credit file had some inaccuracies. One of the credit card companies restored the credit limit on one of my cards but kept the lower limit on the other card. I have filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and would appreciate any advice as I am confused and upset.</p><p><b>Answer: </b>Thats understandable, and youre not alone. Problems with credit bureaus topped the CFPBs list of <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_2022-consumer-response-annual-report_2023-03.pdf" target="_blank">consumer complaints in 2022.</a></p><p>You did all the right things: getting a copy of your credit report, disputing the errors, following up with the credit card companies and filing a complaint with the CFPB when your credit limits werent restored. The CFPB will reach out to companies to help facilitate a resolution.</p><p>If that doesnt work, consider contacting your local congressional representative. These lawmakers typically have constituent services staff that may be able to help.</p><p>You should check your credit reports at Experian and TransUnion in case the errors arent limited to a single bureau. If the inaccuracies stem from possible identity theft, consider freezing your credit reports at all three bureaus to make it harder for scam artists to open new accounts in your name.</p> Should your retirement savings plan include life insurance? Here are some pros and consStudent loan payoff and gift taxes<p><b>Dear Liz: </b>I adopted my granddaughter when she was 2. She has a number of student loans. Do I have the right to pay off her loans as her parent without tax consequences to her or to me?</p><p><b>Answer: </b>Paying off someones student loans would be considered a gift. You may have to file a gift tax return, but youre extremely unlikely to owe gift taxes.</p><p>The IRS requires you to file a gift tax return if you give any individual more than a certain amount in a year. (The 2023 annual exemption limit is $17,000.) You dont owe gift taxes until the amount you give away above this annual limit exceeds the lifetime limit (which is 2023 is $12.92 million). </p><p>Your relationship doesnt matter unless the recipient is your spouse. (You can give an unlimited amount to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen without gift tax consequences.)</p> Should you buy or rent if you plan to move within five years?Social Security and break-even math<p><b>Dear Liz: </b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-montalk-20170430-story.html">You recently wrote about </a>the complexity of retiring with a government pension and Social Security. You left out one very important resource: the Social Security Administration. Going into a Social Security office and sitting with a representative who can explain exactly how much </p> athis <p>person will get (almost impossible to determine <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/wep.html" target="_blank">online using formulas) </a>was the most helpful thing I did. I retired with a government pension at 60 years of age, and at 63 I went to the SS office to chat. I learned that if I waited until full retirement age (67) my break-even point would be 18 years! I slept on the numbers, discussed </p> that<p> with a trusted advisor and filed to take my Social Security benefit. Couldnt be happier. The employees in the local office were wonderful, knowledgeable about the windfall elimination provision and could give exact numbers.</p><p><b>Answer:</b> It sounds like the representative you consulted encouraged you to make your decision using a simple <a href="https://crr.bc.edu/field-work/social-security-the-break-even-debate/" target="_blank">break-even calculation. </a>Thats unfortunate for a number of reasons.</p><p>Break-even calculations typically purport to show the point at which the larger checks you get from delaying your Social Security application outweigh the smaller checks you pass up in the meantime. But the calculators usually dont include important factors, such as inflation, tax rates and the impact of your filing decision on survivor benefits. These calculators also dont include pertinent information about life expectancies. According to Social Security actuarial tables, for example, 63-year-old females in the U.S. can expect to live </p>another  an additional <p>21.24 years.</p><p>Thats average life expectancy, of course. The more educated you are and the more income you make, the more years you can probably add to that tally. And the longer you live, the more likely you are to run through your savings. Many people who are able to make ends meet in their 60s and 70s wind up struggling financially in their 80s because they started Social Security too soon, says actuary Steve Vernon, a former research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity.</p><p>Of course, youll be much less dependent on Social Security than most people, thanks to your pension. Its possible your trusted advisor took that into consideration, along with your longevity profile, tax situation and other possible income sources, when suggesting you apply for a permanently reduced check. Most people cant afford such reductions.</p>Liz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for <p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" target="_blank">NerdWallet.</a></p> Questions may be sent to her at 3940 Laurel Canyon, No. 238, Studio City, CA 91604, or by using the "Contact" form at <p><a href="https://asklizweston.com/" target="_blank">asklizweston.com.</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The 2021 study had a small sample size of 28 participants, but <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more?utm_campaign=ct_prod&amp;utm_source=ap&amp;utm_medium=mpsyn">other research</a> also finds that people are likely to spend more with credit cards. </p><p>And failing to pay off your cards each month tacks on interest charges.</p><p>A vacation from credit card spending isnt for everyone, though. If you want to preserve your credit scores, youll still need to keep zero-balance credit cards open and active with small recurring purchases such as paying for streaming service subscriptions or other similar transactions. Issuers may close inactive accounts, which can cause credit scores to drop.</p><p>By not piling new purchases on your credit cards, you can make more progress on reducing debt or building savings. Here are some instances in which shifting your spending to cash or debit cards can make sense.</p>You frequently overspend in certain categories You might not need to go cold turkey on your credit card spending. <p>If you tend to overspend only in specific categories, consider setting aside a fixed amount of cash or funds on your debit card to cover those expenses. For those purchases that dont lead your budget astray, continue using a credit card and paying it off in full every month to avoid interest charges.</p><p>If, however, you usually overspend across multiple categories, using only cash may help you stay on track.</p>You're an emotional or impulsive spender<p>You may not be aware that youre an emotional or impulsive spender. However, its possible to get an idea by reviewing credit card statements and reflecting on the reasons behind the purchases, said LaQueshia Clemons, a financial therapist at Freedom Life Therapy and Wellness in Connecticut.</p><p>When you get upset or whenever youre emotional, this may be when you find yourself on Amazon or going to the mall, Clemons said. As a way to avoid negative feelings, you may find yourself buying items because this can give you a euphoric feeling to replace the negative emotions.</p><p>If you realize you might be in this category after reviewing your purchases, stop spending with credit cards and analyze your financial habits, she said.</p><p>You might also consider meeting with a financial therapist if its difficult to accomplish financial goals or youre in a continuous cycle of debt. The<a href="https://financialtherapyassociation.org/find-a-financial-therapist/" target="_blank"> Financial Therapy Assn.</a> has a directory to help you find a professional.</p>You can't see a way out of debt<p>If your credit cards are maxed out or youre struggling to keep up with minimum payments, its time to come up with a strategy to pay off the debt.</p><p>After several layoffs early in her career, Aileen Luib, a digital content creator based in California, said she had to rely on credit cards to get by. Her combined balances grew to $10,000 by 2015, putting a wrench in her plans, so she came up with a new one.</p><p>I was kind of tapping into my skill sets to start scraping up money in little corners of my life, and it all added up," Luib said.</p><p>She also used a balance transfer to consolidate debt from several credit cards onto one with a lower interest rate, and she didnt add new purchases to the card. With these tactics, she said, she paid off her balance in 2017.</p><p>Balance transfers typically require a good credit score of 690 or higher. The ideal balance transfer card will have an interest-free window long enough to pay off debt, no annual fee, and a balance transfer fee of 3% or lower. To determine if a transfer is worth it, consider whether the balance transfer fee costs less than what youre projected to pay in interest charges on the current credit card. (An online interest calculator can help.) Youll also make more progress on the debt if you stop putting new purchases on credit cards.</p><p>With less-than-ideal credit, you still have options if its becoming increasingly difficult to meet payments. Consider meeting with a counselor from a nonprofit credit counseling agency. They arent mental health professionals, but they can offer financial guidance and help you determine whether you qualify for a debt management plan that consolidates debt into a single payment with a lower interest rate. Your credit cards may be closed if you enroll in this plan, so expect to shift to cash or debit to cover expenses.</p>Lambarena writes for personal finance site NerdWallet.

A look at 2023's new bills<p>Here are two </p> bills<p> to help renters </p> that cleared a major hurdle <p>and one proposal that flopped this week as the Legislature took action</p> <p>before a key deadline on Friday: </p>Passed: Limiting security deposits <p>The </p>California<p> Assembly easily approved a bill to ban landlords from charging more than one month's rent as a security deposit. </p><p>Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat who authored <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB12" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 12</a>, said that surging rent </p>prices have<p> has made it increasingly difficult for renters to pay security deposits, which can equal up to three months worth of rent, or more than $10,000 in some cities. </p> Newsom says the state is on track to cut unsheltered homelessness by 15% <p>"This means a security deposit can be as much as a down payment on a house in many parts of the country," Haney said before the Assembly approved the measure. "This pushes many families, including those with individuals making minimum wage, to either forgo necessities such as food and utilities or acquire more debt in order to be approved for housing." </p><p>Groups representing landlords opposed the measure, arguing that the lack of affordable housing units, not security deposits, </p>are<p> is the real issue facing California renters, and that AB 12 would harm homeowners. </p><p>"Charging security deposits allows for rental property providers to balance risk associated with renting out property," the California Rental Housing Assn. wrote in a bill analysis.</p> <p>"Without the ability to collect enough in security deposit to cover potential damages, rental property providers may decide to remove their homes from the rental market  further exacerbating the housing supply crisis." </p><p>The bill will now be considered by the Senate, which has until Sept. 14 to vote on it. </p> L.A. County's eviction moratorium has expired. What does that mean for renters?Passed: Curbing evictions<p>In 2019, the Legislature hashed out a deal with landlords and realtors on a bill to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-11/california-renters-relief-legislation-gavin-newsom-rent-cap">establish new rules against evictions and cap yearly rent increases to 5% plus inflation</a>. </p><p>But state Sen. Mara Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) said those protections didn't go far enough. Durazo introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB567" target="_blank">Senate Bill 567</a> this year to lower the rent cap to inflation, not to exceed 5% annually, and strengthen oversight of allowable evictions to ensure landlords aren't exploiting what she described as loopholes in the law. </p><p>Facing pressure from business groups, apartment associations and moderate Democrats, Durazo later removed the rent cap provision of the bill. But advocates pushed hard to keep in accountability measures that would ensure landlords are not using evictions to remove a lower-paying tenant to later jack up the rent. </p><p>"We are all feeling the impact of the homeless crisis in our districts," Durazo said during a Wednesday debate over the bill. "Part of what we have to do is stop the flow of families and people into homelessness." </p> California tenants will see cap on rent increases under bill sent to Newsom<p>The changes Durazo made to the bill did little to appease the opposition. Republicans and a handful of Democrats opposed the measure as</p>  unfair and <p>costly to </p> and unfair for<p> homeowners. </p><p>"This bill will affect small rental property owners the most," said Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones of Santee. "This bill goes a little bit too far." </p><p>The measure narrowly passed the Senate and now heads to the Assembly. </p>Failed: Rent control expansion<p>Lawmakers this week killed one proposal to give tenants more protections</p>  through<p> a measure to expand rent control.</p><p>State Sen. Aisha Wahab (D-Hayward) introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB466" target="_blank">Senate Bill 466</a> to update a<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=2.7.&amp;article=" target="_blank"> 1995 law that limited rent control in California</a> and allow for some newer buildings to become eligible for the price capping. </p><p>"We allow landlords to raise rents with impunity while taxpayers foot the bill for a problem that could be mitigated if jurisdictions were allowed to enact common-sense rent regulation policies," Wahab said during a Wednesday Senate floor debate, while holding up a sleeping bag as a prop to make a point about the worsening homelessness crisis. </p><p>California voters have r<a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-11-04/liberal-california-defeated-rent-control-again-housing-crisis">ejected an expansion of rent control twice in recent elections</a>. Landlord groups, including the California Apartment Assn., contend that rent control stymies construction and discourages homeowners from putting new units on the market. </p> Why liberal California keeps saying no to rent control <p>That argument prevailed in the Senate on Wednesday, when SB 466 failed by a large margin </p>when<p> as </p> s<p>everal Democrats either withheld their votes or joined Republicans in opposing the bill. </p><p>It's unusual for Democrats, who control the Legislature, to bring bills to the floor knowing they will fail because it exposes divisions among the ruling party.</p> <p>Wahab said she anticipated her bill would fall short, but that it was important to see who would go on the record in support.</p><p>"I think it's important for advocates and activists to understand who will go up on a tough issue and who really cares about affordable housing," Wahab said. "I thought it really mattered."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
