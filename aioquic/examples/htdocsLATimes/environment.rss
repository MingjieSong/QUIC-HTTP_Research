More than 9 million people live within 50 miles of the plant.</p><p>Some 73 canisters loaded with spent fuel assemblies have been lowered into vertical cavities at a storage site on the north end of the plant, behind a seawall a little more than 100 feet from the Pacific Ocean. An additional 50 canisters of waste rest horizontally nearby.</p><p>To identify potential sites, the Energy Department will fund 13 groups from different areas of the country to engage, set up workshops and elicit feedback from communities that may be interested in building interim facilities. The 13 groups  partnerships with universities, industry and nonprofits  will receive about $2 million each.</p> California's blistering heat sparked power shortages last summer. Here's this year's forecast<p>"Some communities don't know what it means," Granholm said. "They might be in, they might be out, but the bottom line is we have to form trust and be able to educate them and work with them on what their concerns are." </p><p>Eventually, the Energy Department and the Biden administration want to find one to three communities for what the nuclear industry calls "consolidated interim storage" facilities. </p><p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Consent-Based%20Siting%20Process%20Report-0424%203.pdf" target="_blank">According to a report released in April</a>, the Energy Department estimates the entire process of identifying, screening, selecting and then building an interim storage site will take 10 to 15 years.</p><p>"In this phase, we're beginning the conversation," said <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/person/dr-kathryn-huff" target="_blank">Kathryn Huff, assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy at the Energy Department</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/77/f4/af7df2264dbfb1bd8ec6df77f750/1306742-sd-fi-songs-wastetimeline-ec-002.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Mike_Levin">Rep. Mike Levin</a> (D-San Juan Capistrano) accompanied Granholm on a tour of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, known as SONGS</p> for short<p>. </p><p>"We finally have a plan when it comes to spent nuclear fuel across the United States," Levin said. "Now we've got to execute on that plan." <b> </b></p><p>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government has a legal responsibility to dispose of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/energy-department-seeks-towns-willing-to-temporarily-store-nuclear-waste/">the roughly 89,000 metric tons</a> of waste that has accumulated at nuclear power plants <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/images/reading-rm/doc-collections/maps/isfsi-facility-types.png">in 35 states</a>.</p><p>A giant underground permanent repository was near completion at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada, but in 2010, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/10/yucca.mountain.shutdown/index.html">Obama administration halted the project</a>, after years of opposition from Silver State lawmakers, including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. </p><p>With Yucca off the table, focus has shifted to finding interim facilities. </p> The revolving door at public utilities commissions? It's alive and well<p>To avoid a repeat of Yucca, the Energy Department is now taking a consent-based approach to find communities that may be open to building a storage facility because of the prospect of more local jobs and economic growth.</p><p>"Anything that doesn't include consent can easily be delayed or stopped completely," Huff said. "And we really intend to arrive at a robust and durable solution here  something that will outlast this administration and move out into a longer-term commitment." </p><p>But finding those communities may be difficult. </p><p>A proposed interim facility in southeastern New Mexico has been opposed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and the New Mexico Legislature earlier this year passed a bill <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-4833/new-mexico-sets-up-roadblock-to-holtec-storage-facility/" target="_blank">prohibiting the storage and disposal</a> of radioactive waste without the states consent. The issue may end up in court. </p><p>A similar story is playing out in Texas. A potential storage project in the town of Andrews </p>touts it can is touted as being able to <p>hold as much as 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel for up to 40 years, but Gov. Greg Abbott <a href="https://twitter.com/gregabbott_tx/status/1324939516248010752">tweeted</a>, Texas will not become Americas nuclear dumping ground. (For perspective, San Onofre stores roughly 1,610 metric tons of spent fuel on its premises.)</p> PG&amp;E can keep operating Diablo Canyon  at least for now, feds say<p>One of the concerns for communities considering building an interim storage facility: Will they get stuck with the waste for decades, should the federal government not find a permanent site?</p><p>"That's why we want to have a discussion," Granholm said, "to let [the communities] know what the law says, what the specifics are, get them comfortable. If they don't want to do it, we don't want to force it on anybody. We're confident in the discussions that we've had at this point that there are communities that are willing to engage those discussions to have an interim site."</p><p>There have been signs of progress in other countries. </p><p>Finland, for instance, is nearing completion of its <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2023-06-finland-nuclear-catacombs-ready-house.html" target="_blank">Onkalo spent nuclear fuel disposal facility</a> that will permanently hold 6,500 metric tons of waste produced during the lifetimes of the country's five nuclear reactors. Canada is scheduled to announce a location for a national repository in <a href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-01/final-countdown-to-site-selection-for-canadas-nuclear-waste-geologic-repository/" target="_blank">the fall of 2024</a>. </p><p>"We have not done this right in the United States in the past," Granholm said. "We have said, 'OK, Yucca Mountain, you're it,' without getting the consent of the community that is most affected. This is what we've learned from Finland and Canada. They had a process that was very respectful of communities ... and that's what we're going to do, too." </p><p>As for the search for a permanent site to replace Yucca Mountain, Granholm said that will begin once authorization is approved. "The first step is [interim facilities] and then we'll go on to that later."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/37/43/5b2fafaf43cfb9690fd9ed7dfe21/1306742-sd-fi-songs-wastetimeline-ec-001.jpg"></figure><p>On Capitol Hill, Levin has helped secure <a href="https://levin.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-mike-levin-applauds-department-of-energys-new-plan-for-storage-of-spent-nuclear-fuel" target="_blank">$93 million in funding in the last three fiscal years</a> to move consent-based siting along. </p><p>Levin and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Darrell_Issa">Rep.

"We can do it here and it will work here, too. It won't happen overnight but we've finally got the momentum that we've lacked for the last 10 or 15 years." <b> </b></p><p>San Onofre has not produced electricity since 2012 after a leak in a steam generator tube led to its closing. The plant is now being decommissioned and is in the fourth year of a<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-21/judge-tosses-out-lawsuit-that-sought-to-stop-san-onofre-nuclear-plant-dismantlement"> $4.5-billion dismantlement project</a> that will take roughly eight years to complete and remove about 1.1 billion pounds of material from the site. </p><p>The plant's two distinctive domes, each 190 feet high, are expected to be gradually taken down starting at the end of 2026 or early 2027. </p><p>Representatives of Southern California Edison, which operates San Onofre, said Friday that more than 80% of the canisters could be taken off site now if a storage facility existed and 100% of canisters will be ready to be shipped by 2030. </p>Nikolewski writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But for much of the rest of the world, breathing dangerously polluted air is an inescapable fact of life  and death.</p><p>Almost the entire world breathes air that exceeds the World Health Organization's air-quality limits at least occasionally. The danger grows worse when that bad air is more persistent than the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-31/unprecedented-wildfire-on-canadas-atlantic-coast-still-burning-after-four-days">nightmarish shroud that hit the U.S.</a>  usually in developing or newly industrialized nations. That's where most of the 4.2 million deaths blamed on outdoor air pollution occurred in 2019, the U.N.'s health agency reported.</p><p>Air pollution has no boundaries, and it is high time everyone comes together to fight it, said Bhavreen Kandhari, the co-founder of Warrior Moms in India, a network of mothers pushing for clean air and climate action in a nation with some of the world's consistently worst air. What we are seeing in the U.S. should shake us all."</p><p>This is a severe air pollution episode in the U.S., said Jeremy Sarnat, a professor of environmental health at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. "But its fairly typical for what millions and millions of people experience in other parts of the world. </p><p>Last year, nine of the 10 cities with the highest annual average of fine particulate matter were in Asia  including six in India, according to air quality company IQAir, which aggregates readings from ground level monitoring stations worldwide. </p><p>Fine particulate matter, sometimes denoted as PM 2.5, refers to airborne particles or droplets of 2.5 microns or less. Thats far smaller than a human hair, and the particles can reach deep into lungs to cause eye, nose, throat and lung irritation and even affect heart function.</p><p>Sajjad Haider, a 31-year-old shopkeeper in Lahore, Pakistan, rides his motorbike to work daily. He wears a mask and goggles against frequent air pollution in the city of 11 million, but suffers from eye infections, breathing problems and chest congestion that get worse as smog grows in winter.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c7/8e/7d90500041cfb2fe638d7737fa5f/canada-wildfires-worldwide-air-quality-39812.jpg"></figure><p>On his doctor's advice, he relies on hot water and steam to clear his chest, but said he cannot follow another bit of the doctor's advice: Don't go out on his motorbike if he wants to keep his health.</p><p>I can't afford a car and I can't continue my business without a motorbike," said Haider. </p><p>Last year, Lahore had the world's highest average concentration of fine particulate matter at nearly 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air. By comparison, New York Citys concentration hit 303 at one point on Wednesday.</p> Wildfire smoke has given New York the world's worst air quality. Californians have some tips<p>But New York's air typically falls well within healthy levels. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys standard for exposure is no more than 35 micrograms per day, and no more than 12 micrograms a day for longer-term exposure. New Yorks annual average was 10 or below the past two years.</p><p>New Delhi, a heaving city of more than 20 million where Kandhari lives, usually tops the list of the many Indian cities gasping for breath as haze turns the capital's sky gray and obscures buildings and monuments. It's worse in autumn, when the burning of crop residues in neighboring states coincides with cooler temperatures that trap deadly smoke over the city, sometimes for weeks. </p><p>Vehicle emissions and fireworks set off during the Hindu Diwali festival add to the murk, and the results include coughs, headaches, flight delays and highway pileups. The government sometimes asks residents to work from home or carpool, some schools go online and families that can afford them turn to air purifiers.</p><p>On Thursday, even as a hazardous haze disrupted life for millions across the U.S., New Delhi still ranked as the second-most polluted city in the world, according to daily data from most air quality monitoring organizations. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e6/35/e315ac87402cb7a5d7a5a0f209aa/canada-wildfires-worldwide-air-quality-85607.jpg"></figure><p>Kandhari, whose daughter had to give up outdoor sports over health scares related to the bad air, said the air pollution is constant but policymakers only seem to notice its most acute moments. That has to change, she said.</p><p>We should not compromise when it comes to access to cleaner air, Kandhari said.</p><p>Many African countries in the Sahara Desert regularly grapple with bad air due to sandstorms. On Thursday, AccuWeather gave nations ranging from Egypt to Senegal a rating of purple, for dangerous air quality. It was the same rating given this week to New York and Washington, D.C.</p><p>Senegal has suffered unsafe air for years. It's especially bad in Senegal's east as desertification  the encroachment of the Sahara onto drylands  carries particles into the region, said Dr. Aliou Ba, a senior Greenpeace Africa campaigner based in the capital of Dakar.</p><p>The Great Green Wall, a massive tree-planting effort aimed at slowing desertification, has been underway for years. But Ba said pollution has been growing worse as the number of cars on the road, burning low-quality fuel, increases. </p><p>In the U.S., the 1970 passage of the Clean Air Act cleared up many smog-filled cities by setting limits on most sources of air pollution. The landmark regulation led to curbs on soot, smog, mercury and other toxic chemicals. </p> Wildfires force thousands to flee, damage scores of homes in Canada's Nova Scotia<p>But many developing and newly industrialized nations have weak or little-enforced environmental laws. They suffer increased air pollution for other reasons, too, including a reliance on coal, lower vehicle emissions standards and the burning of solid fuels for cooking and heating.</p><p>In Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, it's often difficult to find clear blue sky, with power plants and vehicle emissions accounting for much of the pollution. It's also one of the world's largest coal-producing nations. </p><p>In one apartment building in the north of the city, between two busy ports where coal is shipped and stockpiled and where factories burn more, residents tried filtering coal dust with a net. It didn't work. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9e/b5/1cfda9894947aed249e49265650c/canada-wildfires-worldwide-air-quality-32488.jpg"></figure><p>My family and I often feel itching and coughing," Cecep Supriyadi, a 48-year-old resident, said. So, when there is a lot of dust entering the flat, yes, we must be isolated at home. Because when we are outside the house, it feels like a sore throat, sore eyes, and itchy skin.</p><p>An Indonesian court in 2021 ruled that leaders had neglected citizens' rights to clean air and ordered them to improve it.</p><p>China has improved since Beijing was notorious for eye-watering pollution that wreathed office towers in haze, diverted flights and sent the old and young to hospitals to be put on respirators. When the air was at its worst, schools that could afford it installed inflatable covers over sports fields with airlock-style revolving doors and home air filters became as ubiquitous as rice cookers.</p><p>Key to the improvement was closing or moving heavy industries out of Beijing and nearby areas. Older vehicles were taken off the road, many replaced with electric vehicles. China still is the worlds largest producer and consumer of coal, but almost none is consumed at street level. The average PM 2.5 reading in Beijing in 2013 of 89.5  well above the WHOs standard of 10  fell to 58 in 2017 and now sits at around 30. China had just one city  Hotan  in the world's top 10 for worst air.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/2e/09/35696bd14125b15ea9ab350e75d3/canada-wildfires-worldwide-air-quality-42564.jpg"></figure><p>Mexico City, ringed by mountains that trap bad air, was one of the most polluted cities in the world until the 1990s, when the government began limiting the number of cars on the streets. Pollution levels dropped, but the city's 9 million people  22 million including suburbs  rarely see a day when air pollution levels are considered acceptable. </p><p>Each year, air pollution is responsible for nearly 9,000 deaths in Mexico City, according to the National Institute of Public Health. It's usually worse in the dry winter and early spring months, when farmers burn their fields to prepare for planting.</p><p>Authorities havent released a full-year air quality report since 2020, but that year  not considered particularly bad for pollution, because the pandemic reduced traffic  Mexico City saw unacceptable air quality on 262 days, or 72% of the year.</p> Los Angeles gets 'F' grade for air quality once again in national report<p>In the summer months, intense rains clean the city's air somewhat. That's what brought Vernica Tobar and her two children out Thursday to a small playground in the Acueducto neighborhood near one of the city's most congested avenues. </p><p>We dont come when we see that the pollution is very strong," Tobar said. Those days you feel it in your eyes, you cry, theyre itchy," she said.</p><p>Her son was diagnosed with asthma last year and changes in temperature make it worse. </p><p>But we have to get out, we cant be locked up, Tobar said as her children jumped off a slide.</p>___Naishadham reported from Washington.

Because they are so small and elusive, many of the sightings through powerful binoculars are categorized as probable or likely. The animals also emit clicks that can be heard through acoustic monitoring devices.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/35/b3/0caaf49641d3ad101068b3d25ced/mexico-endangered-porpoise-09055.jpg"></figure><p>Experts from Mexico, the conservation group Sea Shepherd and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said they sighted at least one and probably two vaquita calves, raising hopes for the survival of the worlds most endangered marine mammal. </p><p>They said there may be more vaquitas out there, since the voyage covered only part of the creatures habitat in the gulf, also known as the Sea of Cortez. It lives nowhere else, and the species cannot be </p>captured,<p> held or bred in captivity.</p><p>But it is far too soon to celebrate. Illegal gill nets have trapped and killed vaquitas for decades; the population has declined from nearly 600 vaquitas in 1997. </p><p>Fishermen set the nets to catch totoaba, a fish whose swim bladder is considered a delicacy in China and can fetch thousands of dollars per pound.</p><p>While the Mexican government has made some efforts to stop the net fishing  like sinking concrete blocks with hooks to snag nets  the fishermen still appear to have the upper hand, entering the protected area to fish on a daily basis and even sabotaging monitoring efforts.</p><p>According to the report, fishermen have begun removing the acoustic devices used to record vaquita clicks. The data recorded on each device is lost, and it is expensive to replace" them.</p><p>Unless enforcement of the fishing ban is effective and the theft of equipment is stopped, acoustic monitoring cannot collect data as it has in the past, the report stated.</p><p>Researcher Barbara Taylor called on Mexico to sink more concrete blocks to snag nets, because some of the vaquitas were seen outside the protected area.</p><p>The expedition, from May 10 to 26, crisscrossed a corner of the gulf where the </p>few<p> remaining vaquitas had last been seen.</p><p>Alex Olivera, the Mexico representative for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this is encouraging news and it shows that vaquita are survivors. But we still need urgent conservation efforts to save these tiny porpoises from extinction. </p><p>Olivera, who was not part of the expedition, estimated that even in a gill net-free habitat, it will take about 50 years for the population to return to where it was 15 years ago, adding "we need Mexico to urgently comply with existing regulations to prevent the vaquita from disappearing forever.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-20/mexico-president-lopez-obrador-advice-us-moral-decay">President Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador</a>s administration has largely declined to spend money to compensate fishermen for staying out of the vaquita refuge and stop using gill nets, or monitor their presence or the areas they launch from.</p><p>Sea Shepherd has been working in the gulf alongside the Mexican navy to discourage illegal fishing in the area known as the zero tolerance zone, and no fishing is supposedly allowed there. However, illegal fishing boats are regularly seen there, and so Mexico has been unable to completely stop them.</p><p>Pritam Singh, Sea Shepherds chairman, said that patrols with the Mexican navy have reduced the number of hours that fishing boats spend in the restricted zone by 79% in 2022</p>,<p> compared to the previous year.</p><p>The last vaquita sighting expedition in 2021 yielded probable sightings of five to 13 vaquitas, a decline from the previous survey in 2019. </p><p>Illegal fishing itself has impeded population calculations in the past.</p><p>According to a report by experts published in 2022, both the 2019 and 2021 surveys were hindered by the presence of many illegal fishing boats with gill nets in the water. Some areas could not be surveyed at all on some days due to the density of illegal fishing.</p><p>The governments protection efforts have been uneven, at best, and also often face violent opposition from local fishermen.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"There's a little bit of PTSD involved from that whole experience." </p><p>For much of Thursday, the air quality in Himrod was <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Himrod&amp;state=NY&amp;country=USA" target="_blank">classified as "unhealthy"</a> by the U.S. Air Quality Index</p> . Salpeter and Sweet <p>founded Sweet Farm in Half Moon Bay in northern California in 2015. But in August 2020, the sanctuary </p> was threatened by the<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-23/massive-california-firestorms-expected-to-worsen-with-more-lightning-winds">CZU Lightning Complex fire</a>, which ravaged San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. In just four hours, a team of about 45 </p>people of <p>workers and community volunteers evacuated more than 140 animals, including cows, pigs, ducks, goats</p>,<p> and a 37-year old stallion called Sturgis</p> ,<p> to two other sanctuaries out of the raging fire's path.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/30/81/16bf9cb74d10802e39c9a86a57ee/la-na-pol-dc-wildfires-animal-sanctuary-sturgis.JPG"></figure><p>The fire, which <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/16/czu-lightning-complex-including-warnella-fire/" target="_blank">destroyed 1     ,  500 properties and consumed 86,000 acres</a>, ultimately spared the farm, but the sanctuary's team found the experience difficult</p> ,<p> nonetheless. Just going through that experience was extremely traumatic, it was stressful for the animals, for the team, and everyone involved, Salpeter told The Times on Thursday.</p><p>That close call was a catalyst. After years of wildfires, droughts and other extreme climate conditions, Salpeter and Sweet decided to relocate the animal sanctuary to Himrod, a town in western New York that they determined to be climate</p>-<p> stable and also close to Sweets hometown, Penn Yan.</p><p>If it wasnt that [CZU fire] that actually burned down the farm or caused catastrophe, when would the next one happen and would that be the one that actually burns it down? Salpeter said. We wanted to [move] on our own terms, before it was an eleventh</p> -<p>hour emergency.</p><p>Climate change has influenced other Californians' migration decisions. Stanford University's Nina Berlin Rubin and Gabrielle Wong-Parodi <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9399564/" target="_blank">found in a recent study</a> of 1</p> ,<p>100 California residents that "experiencing negative outcomes during the 2020 wildfire season was associated with an increased likelihood of intending to migrate." About a third of respondents intended to move in the next </p>5 five <p>years, and nearly a quarter of those likely to move reported that wildfire and smoke </p>impacted  influenced <p>their decision at least a moderate amount.</p><p>In May 2022, after months of planning, paperwork and animal blood tests, the </p> Sweet Farm team loaded t heir <p>cows, sheep, geese, pigs, llamas and chickens  and the aging Sturgis  onto two 18-wheeler trucks to make the 47-hour, nearly 3</p> ,<p>000-mile journey to Himrod.</p>That sense of safety and serenity was disrupted this week when wildfires burning in neighbouring Canada brought a smoky haze across New York state and the rest of the East Coast region of the United States. The East Coast which has largely been spared the smog and bright red sun as a result of wildfires is now getting a taste of harsh conditions that have become all too familiar in California and the West.<p>A year later, Salpeter says he and Sweet have no regrets. The lake provides them easy access to fresh water, and the region has a wine industry, which is a reminder of their former home. They are no longer under the near-constant threat of wildfires and other extreme climate events. </p><p>But this week's harsh conditions have also provided a reminder.</p><p>"No one is immune, no one is completely unaffected by climate change, no matter where you're located," Salpeter said.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, employers will be required come Jan. 1 to compensate goat herders at an hourly rate, now set at $15.50 for farmworkers, plus required overtime. </p><p>And given <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-goat-herder-20181222-story.html">the nature of a goat herders' job</a>, which is considered on-call 24/7, industry leaders and the California Farm Bureau estimate that change would come out to </p>an<p> almost $14,000 a month. </p><p>We cant afford that; cities cant afford that," said Tim Arrowsmith, the owner and manager of Western Grazers in Red Bluff, who employs a few dozen herders for his several thousand goats. He said that monthly salary is almost four times what he currently pays his goat herders, which he already considers a fair wage, noting that they are also provided with housing, groceries, cell</p> <p>phones and clothes.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b6/b3/4400722f4be58336304538d467df/la-me-california-goats-reduce-wildfire-fuel-01.JPG"></figure><p>Arrowsmith said if this switch goes into effect next year, he will not be able to sustain his goat-grazing business  and many areas in need of his easy and eco</p>-<p>friendly fire abatement will be at a loss. </p><p>Weve lost millions of homes ... we've had <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-07/when-wildfires-are-too-fast-to-escape">loss of life</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-paradise-survivors-20181202-htmlstory.html">towns have burned up</a>" from wildfires, Arrowsmith said.

But even as birders celebrate the return of wet conditions along portions of the Pacific Flyway, experts worry that this liquid avian <p>bonanza </p> could ultimately poison tens of thousands of the avians  animals <p>as temperatures rise and newly formed lakes and ponds begin to evaporate. </p><p>The concern: botulism.</p><p>"Botulism occurs naturally in the soil and in the Tulare basin," said John Carlson, president of the </p>California Wildfowl Association California Waterfowl Assn.<p> "When the water temperature heats up during the summer and gets stagnant, the botulism really kind of booms, and you can have </p>a <p>multi-thousand-bird die-offs."</p> Carlson estimates there is a<p> "high probability" of a die-off this summer. </p> That grim prognosis has added<p> to the emotional whiplash bird lovers and wildlife officials have experienced in recent years as extreme climate variability has gripped the West Coast, alternately parching and starving waterfowl and providing them with a surfeit of habitat.</p><p>"We have loads of breeding ducks like </p>cinammon cinnamon<p> teal, gadwalls and mallards that are really utilizing these floodwaters all throughout the Tulare Lake basin area," and beyond, said Matt Kaminski, a regional biologist for </p> the hunting and conservation group, <p>Ducks Unlimited.</p><p>But now relief from the rains is turning into trepidation as conditions ripen for a major outbreak.</p>Clostridium botulinum<p>, a toxin</p> -producing bacteria<p>, flourishes in warm, shallow waters. The soil bacteria </p>is <p>are taken up by aquatic invertebrates, which in turn are eaten by waterfowl and other birds. </p><p>In 2020, an estimated 60,000 birds died in the Klamath River basin when the few remaining wetlands of this once-rich marsh expanse dried up  forcing thousands of birds into </p>the same, <p>small, muddy holes where exposure became rampant.</p><p>It's an insidious and gruesome death for the poisoned birds, who become unable to move their muscles as the bacteria </p> bind blinds <p>to nerve endings, impeding their ability to walk or fly. Eventually, they are unable to hold up even their heads  often drowning in the dank puddles they stopped at to quench their thirst.</p><p>Carlson said his organization is working with the </p> California <p>Department of Fish and Wildlife </p>to prepare, <p>so that, should an outbreak occur, they'll be ready to flush the wetlands with freshwater  if it's available  and have crews ready to clean up carcasses as quickly as possible.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/1c/b8/6736cb1b464abd0fcae22c32caa4/1240952-me-capturing-floodwater-recharge-12-cmc.jpg"></figure> Cleanup is crucial<p>, Carlson said, because botulism can be further spread by the fly maggots that infest dead birds. "Live birds see those maggots and say 'that's a good meal' and they start eating those maggots. Those maggots have botulism in them."</p><p>Carlson said he is hopeful the summer stays cool  which would lessen the threat. And if he had to choose between a botulism outbreak and another drought, he'd take the outbreak.</p><p>"We have approximately 6 million ducks and geese come down in the winter every year," he said. "If you lose 50,000 to botulism, that's tragic. But it's nothing compared to the hundreds of thousands, maybe millions you'll lose if there's no water</p> <p> and they're displaced."</p>Just this past  As recently as <p>December, wildlife biologists and birders were fretting about the drought's impact on the well-being </p>and survival <p>of birds migrating along the Pacific </p> Flyway  flyway<p>. </p><p>"The problem is that when they come here for the winter they need to have food and shelter and water to survive the winter," </p>said<p> Carlson </p> said<p>. "And so if </p>you<p> one part of their life cycle is in horrible shape because of a drought, then when they go back up north to breed, if their body condition is in really bad shape, then you know you're gonna have unsuccessful breeding and unsuccessful nests  the whole nine yards."</p> Heavy rain and snow this winter<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-01/epic-snowpack-throws-sierra-nevada-ecosystems-into-turmoil">brought a helpful reprieve</a>.</p><p>"We had a colony of </p>White  white<p>-faced ibis nest, and we're actually starting to see some of the young fledge," said Miguel Jimenez, project leader for the Kern National Wildlife Refuge Complex. </p>He said in  In past years,<p> he said, the ibises would either "just utilize this for a roosting site and wouldn't nest because of the lack of water,</p>.

Even with this influx of water, however, scientists said they dont yet know how much of it will make its way underground, and that it will likely only recoup a portion of the groundwater that has been extracted to supply agriculture during years of severe drought.</p><p>One good winter of rain and snow wont make up for years of extreme drought and extensive groundwater use, said Felix Landerer, a research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p><p>We have accumulated quite a bit of water debt, groundwater debt, over the last 20 years, Landerer said.</p><p>Plotted on a chart, the satellite measurements </p> of the total amount of water in the region<p> form a line that, through seasonal ups and downs, has declined dramatically during the droughts from 2012-2016 and 2019-2022, reflecting major losses in total water resources. In 2023, the line has risen sharply.</p><p>Even though we had a lot of water gain, much of that is in the surface, Landerer said. That means much of the water remains in rivers, lakes, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151422/california-reservoir-rebound?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">reservoirs</a> and the soil, as well as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-15/planes-track-california-historic-snowpack">frozen in the snowpack</a>. So far, he said, not much has percolated down to aquifers.</p><p>It's actually pretty dry still down below, Landerer said. The key point is now, how much groundwater recharge will there be?</p><p>He and other scientists plan to track that as the snow melts and runoff courses through the Central Valley over the next several months.</p><p>In other <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-12-22/groundwater-depletion-is-accelerating-in-the-central-valley">recent research</a>, scientists have found that the pace of groundwater depletion accelerated in recent years during the drought.</p><p>Data for the last two decades  and earlier data going back to the 1960s  reveal successive drops in average water levels in a step-like pattern, with brief wet periods that have only temporarily slowed the declines.</p><p>Over the long term, groundwater is in a pretty steep decline, said J.T. Reager, a scientist at </p>the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL<p>.</p><p>In wet years, we get a little bit of a recovery, and then in dry years, when there's not a lot of surface water or snowmelt, we tend to hit the groundwater really hard, Reager said. We never get the recovery to replace what we're drawing down, what we're using during the dry years.</p><p>The Central Valley is one of the worlds major farming regions, producing almonds, pistachios, grapes, walnuts, tangerines, rice and other crops, as well as cattle and dairy products.</p><p>The research is based on data collected from two NASA satellite missions. The current pair of satellites, which <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2018/05/22/nasas-satellites-track-shifts-water-supplies-worldwide/633652002/" target="_blank">launched into orbit</a> in 2018, track changes in Earth's gravity field to measure shifts in the total amounts of water, above and below ground.</p><p>The big question for this year, with all of the snow and rain that we received, is really how much of that rain and snowmelt is going to recharge that groundwater? Reager said. How much of that water can infiltrate the soil?</p><p>If all the water could be channeled underground, it would bring a tremendous recovery, he said. But he said its possible a lot of the water may not reach the aquifer.</p><p>Part of the reason relates to the valleys geology. There are clay layers in many areas that hinder the downward movement of water, while in other areas, water passes swiftly through <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-18/hidden-riverbeds-may-be-key-to-recharghing-aquifers">permeable layers of sediment</a>.</p><p>The water streaming down from the Sierra Nevada has inundated vast farmlands in the southern San Joaquin Valley, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-23/risk-of-catastrophic-flooding-has-diminished-in-tulare-lake">re-forming Tulare Lake</a>, which according to state officials now covers more than 113,000 acres, an area nearly as large as Lake Tahoe.</p><p>State water officials have sought to make it easier for local water districts and farms to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-21/california-looks-to-farmland-to-recharge-groundwater">use floodwaters to recharge depleted aquifers</a>.</p><p>Since December, the State Water Resources Control Board has issued 10 temporary permits for agencies to divert water for groundwater recharge projects, all but one of them in the Central Valley. The board also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-11/california-will-use-floodwater-to-recharge-groundwater">approved a request</a> by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to divert floodwaters from the San Joaquin River and send much of that water flowing to lands where it spreads out and soaks into the ground.</p><p>These approvals allow for the diversion of more than <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2023/PR-on-1-million-AF-of-GW-Recharge.pdf" target="_blank">1.2 million acre-feet</a> of water  more supplies than Folsom Lake reservoir can hold  for groundwater recharge, wildlife refuges and other purposes. State officials say its the largest amount of water they have made available for groundwater replenishment in such a short period.</p><p>The state has taken unprecedented action to leverage the benefits of our recent wet weather by replenishing our groundwater resources, said Yana Garcia, secretary of Californias Environmental Protection Agency. She said its an example of how the state is taking steps to become more resilient as climate change makes extreme droughts and floods <a href="https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/news/151/warming-makes-droughts-extreme-wet-events-more-frequent-intense/" target="_blank">more intense and more frequent</a>.</p><p>State water officials have also been <a href="https://www.watereducation.org/western-water/high-tech-mapping-central-valleys-underground-blazes-path-drought-resilience" target="_blank">conducting aerial surveys</a> to map optimal areas for groundwater recharge, using helicopters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-18/hidden-riverbeds-may-be-key-to-recharghing-aquifers">equipped with electromagnetic imaging systems</a> that peer underground to reveal fast pathways for replenishing aquifers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the effects of overpumping have continued to affect rural communities, where some residents whose wells have gone dry <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-18/many-californians-with-dry-wells-face-long-wait-for-fixes">rely on trucked shipments of water</a> to fill their household tanks. The state has received reports of 249 dry household wells this year. State regulators have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-03/groundwater-plans-deemed-inadequate-by-california-regulators">told local groundwater management agencies</a> in large portions of the San Joaquin Valley that their plans for combating overpumping are inadequate.</p><p>Researchers have said addressing the long-term groundwater deficit will likely require taking large portions of farmland out of production and that planning will be key in transitioning some agricultural land to other purposes, such as solar farms, crops that consume less water or habitat restoration areas.</p><p>This extremely wet year, and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-snowpack-melting-water-supply-flood/" target="_blank">historic levels of snowpack</a> that remain, offer the conditions for a rare experiment to see how much the groundwater levels might rise in the Central Valley, Reager said.</p><p>This year, we've got this nearly infinite supply of recharge, he said. How much can you actually get in the ground? And that's what we're looking to see.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday was by far the nations worst day in recent history for wildfire smoke pollution, with more people exposed to higher levels of soot than any day since 2006, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallBBurke/status/1666843238270128129">rapid analysis by Stanford University scientists</a>.</p><p>Thats hardly a surprise to people from New York to Minnesota who have been suffering under this acrid, life-threatening pall. And its the type of in-your-face environmental health crisis that Californians know too well, with authorities urging people to stay inside and filter the air they breathe and canceling outdoor activities, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill">large numbers of people</a> almost certainly getting sick or dying. The second-worst smoke day, after all, was in September 2020, when the haze from an explosion of climate-fueled wildfires up and down the West Coast blotted out the sun, shrouding San Francisco in an apocalyptic orange and contributing to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/23/smoke-from-california-fires-may-have-killed-more-than-1000-people/?clearUserState=true">potentially thousands of early deaths</a>.</p><p>The otherworldly veil that has hung over some of the nations most densely populated areas is the latest illustration of the fact that an overheating planet knows no human-made boundaries, and that as much as we try, no one will be spared the impacts. Everyone, after all, has to breathe.</p><p>These wildfire smoke episodes are disasters as serious as hurricanes, floods or heat waves, and come with a steep human toll. Whether in the East or in the West, they are just one tragic example of how climate change is coming for us all in both a slow accretion and sudden, dramatic bursts.</p><p>We often talk about global warming in terms of incremental change, like fractions of degrees over decades. But it also moves quickly, through the amplification of extreme events such as California's recent spate of record-breaking wildfires, the deadly 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome that pushed temperatures in Portland, Ore., to an unthinkable 116 degrees </p>Fahrenheit <p>and the torrential rain of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 that <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/digest/hurricane-harvey-climate-change-double-flooding-homes">flooded tens of thousands of homes</a> </p> in Texas and Louisiana. <p>Now we add to this horrible list the Manhattan skyline enveloped in a</p> <p> sickly sepia smog that looks </p>like  as if<p> it floated out of the dystopian world of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4">Blade Runner 2049</a>."</p><p>These smoke-filled vistas should be front of mind when we talk about the climate crisis, because they send a clear signal that it's a health crisis too.</p><p>And unfortunately, many Americans can expect more smoky days like these in their future. Much like heat waves, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/smoke-waves-will-affect-millions/">smoke waves,</a> a term researchers coined several years ago to describe consecutive days of unhealthy air quality from wildfires, are expected to grow more frequent, long-lasting and intense over the next few decades. Growing numbers of people will have to contend with unhealthy levels of smoke, a particularly nasty type of pollution that lodges deep in the lungs and can enter the bloodstream to worsen asthma, lung and heart disease and cut lives short.</p><p>The increase in smoke pollution, driven by bigger, more intense fires fueled by human-caused global warming, has already been <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30882">eroding hard-won improvements</a> in the nations air quality from decades of emissions-cutting regulations. And even people living hundreds of miles from a wildfire can pay a grave health toll. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/20/wildfire-smoke-deaths-eastern-us/">One 2021 study found</a> that about three-quarters of the wildfire smoke-related asthma emergency room visits and deaths in recent years occurred east of the Rocky Mountains, due to the regions higher population density.</p><p>We have a chance to reduce this suffering, and prevent an even worse lung-choking reality for future generations. But only if we use this as an inflection point to get serious about slashing climate pollution and putting an end to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Lets not wait until the smoke clears to start. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

In the San Francisco Bay Area, powerful storms felled trees, prompted widespread power outages and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-21/southern-california-spring-storm-strong-wind-heavy-rain">sent glass tumbling from skyscrapers</a> onto city streets. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/1a/bb/eb1aebe049928c611006e6796e56/ap23071778063411.jpg"></figure><p>And in the Tulare Lake region, floodwater and melting snow rushed over low-lying fields and ranches, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-24/as-tulare-lake-reappears-floodwaters-raise-tensions-in-san-joaquin-valley">refilling the dormant basin for the first time in decades</a>. Officials say the area could remain underwater for at least two years. </p><p>Aside from regional variations, "big partisan differences" permeated most of the responses to climate questions, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the IGS poll. Forty percent of Democrats said they were somewhat or greatly affected by the winter storms, compared with 16% of Republicans.</p>put updated graphic here<p>There was an even greater divide among those who are concerned that extreme weather will get worse  91% of Democrats compared with only 28% of Republicans, the poll found.</p><p>"I think Republicans have a different mindset, and perhaps that leads to greater tolerance of some of the hardships that they may be seeing around them," DiCamillo said. "That also probably leads to a much smaller proportion of Republicans saying, 'I'm very concerned about these weather events in the future that may lead me to want to move from where I live.'"</p><p>Ellen Hanak, vice president and director of the Water Policy Center at the Public Policy Institute of California, said concerns about worsening weather extremes are warranted.</p><p>"California's precipitation patterns have always been volatile, with swings between wet and dry periods, but we are already beginning to see signs of increasing weather whiplash  with more intense dry and wet periods  and this is expected to increase in coming decades," Hanak said.</p><p>The poll's findings are broadly consistent with annual surveys conducted by PPIC</p>, which that<p> track Californians' views about climate change impacts, she said.</p><p>The institute's <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-the-environment-july-2022/" target="_blank">survey from July 2022</a> found that nearly </p> 7 in 10seven in ten<p> Californians think the effects of climate change have already begun, and </p> 8 in 10eight in ten<p> say climate change is a serious threat to Californias future economy and way of life.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c6/7e/45ab06ad4034b1a6f3028cf161c4/california-wildfires-99056.jpg"></figure><p>It's likely that more Californians will have to move away from their homes due to changing climate conditions  notably, increasing wildfire risk, Hanak said.</p><p>"To my mind, increasing wildfire risk may cause some of the biggest shifts in this regard, especially as it becomes more difficult and expensive to purchase insurance," Hanak said.</p><p>Just last week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-farm-halts-home-insurance-sales-in-california-5748c771?utm_id=99473&amp;sfmc_id=2807928" target="_blank">State Farm halted home insurance sales in California</a>, citing rising costs and wildfire risks. </p><p>Hanak noted that the risks are often greatest for lower-income communities and residents with fewer resources and less capacity to adapt. </p><p>Despite some divisions, respondents to the IGS poll were somewhat more aligned across the spectrum when it </p> came comes <p>to one of California's most ingrained environmental principles: water conservation.</p><p>Eighty-one percent of respondents  including 95% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans  said that despite this year's unusually wet winter, it's still important for the state to enforce its water conservation policies and programs for residential, commercial and agricultural water users in the coming years. </p><p>Among such efforts are two bills passed Wednesday by the state Assembly. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1572" target="_blank">AB 1572</a> would prohibit the use of drinking water for purely decorative grass along roads, in medians, at public and institutional properties, </p> and at<p> businesses and multifamily housing developments. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1573" target="_blank">AB 1573</a> would require non</p>-<p>residential projects to eliminate the use of non</p>-<p>functional turf and transition to low-water and local native plants beginning in 2026. </p><p>"This is really grass where the only time you walk on it is to mow it," said Tracy Quinn, president and </p>CEO chief executive<p> of Heal the Bay, which supported AB 1572 along with the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p><p>"There is really broad agreement among stakeholders, including many water agencies, that there really is no place for nonfunctional turf in our communities," Quinn said. "We just don't have the water to be able to waste, to keep grass alive when it's serving a purely aesthetic function."</p><p>The ban on decorative grass would take effect in phases between 2027 and 2031. The proposal would make permanent measures that California water regulators have imposed on a temporary basis. </p><p>DiCamillo said the broad agreement on the matter speaks to Californians' ethos of water conservation. </p><p>"I believe that Californians have been conditioned now to value water, and to conserve as much as they can because there may be years when we dont have much," he said. However, he noted that Democrats were more than twice as likely </p> than Republicans<p> to rank water conservation as "very important."</p> than Republicans. <p>The poll was conducted from May 17 to May 22  only days before California and six other states reached a tentative agreement on how to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-22/seven-states-announce-colorado-river-water-deal-agreeing-on-water-cuts-for-three-years">dramatically reduce the use of the Colorado River</a>, a lifeline that supplies water to nearly 40 million people in the West. </p><p>About 60% of respondents said they favored reductions in water deliveries from the Colorado, while 14% said the status quo should continue. Twenty-seven percent said they were uncertain.</p><p>The poll also comes <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-19/return-of-el-nino-would-have-far-reaching-impacts">ahead of the expected return of El Nio</a> later this year. The climate pattern in the tropical Pacific is associated with wetter winters in Southern California and hotter temperatures across the globe.</p><p>Forecasters say there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years  and the five-year period as a whole  will be the Earth's warmest on record.</p><p>The poll was administered online in English and Spanish among 7,465 California registered voters. </p><p>The poll sample was weighted to match census and voter registration benchmarks. Because of weighting, precise estimates of the margin of error are difficult, but the results are estimated to have a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points in either direction for the full sample.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

An analysis by the Los Angeles Times found that within this class of chemicals, called perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the two most common compounds were detected in 86 water systems that serve up to </p> 9 <p>million Californians.</p><p>State officials released the water quality results on Monday, the first step in what's likely to be a years-long effort to track the scale of the contamination and pinpoint its sources. Only a small fraction of California's thousands of drinking water wells were tested in this initial study. Officials said they planned to examine many more, but have not committed to future statewide testing.</p><p>The results offered the clearest picture yet of California's exposure to a public health crisis that is playing out nationally.</p><p>"This has the potential of being an enormously costly issue both on the health side as well as on the mitigation and regulatory side," said Kurt Schwabe, an environmental policy professor at UC Riverside. "It's going to be one of the defining issues in California, environmentally, for decades."</p><p>About half of the wells sampled did not have the chemicals at detectable levels  a result that state officials said was a hopeful sign the contaminants may not have spread as widely as they have in other states. Yet testing found contaminated drinking water in communities across California, from densely-populated cities with large and complex water systems to mobile home parks that depend on a single private well.</p><p>Clusters of contaminated wells were found in Southern California, in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The city of Los Angeles did not detect the chemicals in its water, but neighboring Glendale did.</p><p>In some cases, the testing had an immediate effect  the city of Anaheim has shut down three of its drinking water wells so far this year in response to elevated levels of the chemicals.</p><p>Exposure to the chemicals, commonly known as PFAS, has been traced to kidney and testicular cancer, as well as high cholesterol and thyroid disease. Mothers and young children are thought to be the most vulnerable to the chemicals, which can affect reproductive and developmental health.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3a/e7/970239b044668be4c312689bd197/la-photos-1staff-468667-la-na-pol-pfas-contamination-ca-504.jpg"></figure><p>Scientists have called them "forever chemicals" because they persist indefinitely and accumulate in the human body.</p><p>The chemicals were developed in the 1940s and used in countless household products, from Teflon cookware and Scotchgard to waterproof clothing and food packaging. They were also a key ingredient in firefighting foam used on military bases and, as a result, have become a major source of groundwater pollution.</p><p>A Times analysis found that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-10-08/firefighting-foam-leaves-toxic-legacy-california-water" target="_blank">California has 21 contaminated bases</a>, more than any other state, including six where the chemicals have leached into off-base drinking water supplies.</p><p>There is no agreed-upon safe level of PFAS. The Environmental Protection Agency has classified the chemicals as an "emerging contaminant" and has delayed setting a national standard for limiting the levels in drinking water. In 2016, the agency issued a nonbinding health advisory for two of the most common types, PFOS and PFOA, recommending that water utilities notify the public if levels of the chemicals reached a combined 70 parts per trillion.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/7e/f583d7d1479c94e716768a591dc5/la-photos-1staff-468667-la-na-pol-pfas-contamination-ca-446.jpg"></figure><p>California health officials are developing their own safety standards for the contaminants.</p><p>A state law that takes effect in January will require utilities to inform customers if PFAS are found at any level. It will also force water systems to either shut down wells that test over the federal health advisory level or notify their customers of the contamination  steps that, at present, are only voluntary.</p><p>For the first round of testing, California's State Water Resources Control Board focused on hundreds of wells located within one or two miles of commercial airports, municipal landfills, and water supplies already known to have elevated levels of the chemicals. Each of these wells was tested for about a dozen different compounds within the broader PFAS family, which includes thousands of unique chemicals.</p><p>Officials plan to widen their search in the coming months to include drinking water systems near military bases, manufacturing hubs and wastewater treatment plants.</p><p>California has about 3,000 water providers, most of which have not been ordered to test for PFAS. Those that have been forced to confront the problem have looked for solutions based on what they can afford and whether they have other sources of clean water readily available.</p><p>An example of this can be found in the cities of Oroville and Chico. Both have detected PFAS in their drinking water wells, but because Oroville gets the majority of its water from Lake Oroville, in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, local water suppliers there can reduce their reliance on groundwater without feeling pinched. Chico, on the other hand, is dependent on groundwater wells.</p><p>"Every water system is different, and that changes the options that you have," said Loni Lind, water quality manager for California Water Service, which supplies both towns.</p><p>In interviews with The Times, water district managers emphasized that having contaminated groundwater wells does not necessarily mean that residents are being exposed to dangerous levels of PFAS. Some utilities have treated the water to remove most of the chemicals, while others have started blending contaminated water with other sources to lower their concentration. Still others have closed wells or put them on emergency-use-only status.</p><p>In Orange County, where testing ordered by the state found PFAS chemicals in 10 different water systems, four groundwater wells with elevated levels of the chemicals have been shut down.</p><p>Jason Dadakis, Orange County Water District's executive director of water quality, said that based on water testing, the district concluded that the chemicals were coming from wastewater treatment plants in Riverside and San Bernardino. Those facilities discharge water into the Santa Ana River, he said, which feeds the county's groundwater basin.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/bf/85/b9ec359545e6b6c1650cd6886e07/la-photos-1staff-468667-la-na-pol-pfas-contamination-ca-451.jpg"></figure><p>Sewage treatment plants aren't designed to remove a compound like PFAS, Dadakis said. "It just passes through their system."</p><p>If the chemicals spread and the district is forced to treat the water, Orange County residents could see their water bills rise by as much as 15%, Dadakis said.</p><p>Local water suppliers in other parts of the state said they had no idea where the chemicals could be coming from, but they expected answering that question would take years of investigation.</p><p>"It's really difficult to say what's happening and where it's being generated," said Tom Moody, who oversees the city of Corona's water system, where eight wells tested above the EPA's health advisory level. Rather than close them all down, the city now sends water from these wells through an existing treatment plant.</p><p>"In my generation, we probably absorbed this chemical in everything from tennis shoes to popcorn and pizza and all that stuff," Moody said.

In fact, test results showed the water contained toxic chemicals from firefighting foam used for decades on a now-shuttered Air Force base a mile away. Church leaders say they did not understand their well was contaminated.</p><p>The churchs well is one of thousands of water sources </p> located <p>on and near military bases polluted with chemicals from the foam, which was used by the armed services since the 1960s.</p><p>Defense Department officials know that the chemicals, called per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, have seeped into the groundwater underneath nearly two dozen military bases throughout the state. But the department has conducted only limited testing off base and cannot say how many civilian water sources they've polluted or who will pay for it.</p><p>Since 2016, when the Environmental Protection Agency classified PFAS as an emerging contaminant linked to liver cancer and other health problems, the Pentagon has found the pollutants at levels above federal health guidelines in soil and groundwater at more than 90 bases nationwide.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c8/99/4d890d6741588949f1c52f56fc63/la-photos-freelance-contract-464346-na-pol-environmental-hazards08-mw.JPG"></figure><p>California has the most of any state, with contamination at 21 bases, including six where the chemicals threaten the water supply in nearby communities, according to a review of hundreds of pages of Defense Department records by the Los Angeles Times.</p><p>In Riverside County, Barstow, Orange County and Sacramento, PFAS have been detected in private wells or public water systems outside the boundaries of military installations</p> , <p>records show.</p><p>At Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos and Fresno Air National Guard Base, the chemicals are suspected of moving into the community water supply.</p><p>One military contractor warned in September that residents "using groundwater for drinking water" near Los Alamitos may potentially be exposed to migrating PFAS contamination. Another contractor said in March that five wells west of the Fresno airfield could be affected.</p><p>But the Pentagon has not completed off-base testing at either location, and at other California bases, leaving the full extent of the contamination unknown.</p><p>The Pentagon faces the prospect of a gigantic environmental cleanup that officials estimate could cost in excess of $2 billion and take decades to complete. The day Defense Secretary Mark Esper took office in July, he appointed a task force to oversee the Pentagon response.</p><p>Wherever they have already found PFAS in drinking water above the EPA health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, the military has supplied bottled water, paid for filters and purchased clean water for both military personnel and civilians, officials say.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/5b/4b/69e6d118402995cd4a673b8415cd/la-na-pol-aqueous-film-foaming-foam-03-copy.JPG"></figure><p>Our first priority is to cut off human exposure, and everywhere weve identified that someones drinking water is above the EPA health advisory level, we are doing everything we can to provide alternative drinking water, Maureen Sullivan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for environment, said in an interview.</p><p>Citing limited funds from Congress for cleanup and testing, the Defense Department only acts when water sampling finds contamination levels above EPA health advisory level for two of the most common variations of PFAS.</p><p>The threshold, which was set in 2016, is nonbinding, and officials in several states have set much more stringent standards. Congress is currently debating whether to force the Trump administration to adopt an enforceable nationwide standard, a proposal the White House has said it opposes.</p><p>California regulators have few legal tools to force the Pentagon to expand its sampling to groundwater near bases.</p><p>Were doing everything we can to compel the owner, the Department of Defense, to conduct the investigations, to show us its not a problem, said Doug Smith, assistant executive officer with Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board, which monitors groundwater at seven California bases.</p><p>According to the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research organization, about 85% of Californians depend on groundwater for some portion of their water supply.</p><p>Regulators and environmental groups warn that the slow pace of Pentagon testing has left an unknown number of people drinking contaminated water.</p><p>The PFAS plumes are spreading near these military bases, and DOD is turning a blind eye, said Jane Williams, executive director of California Communities Against Toxics, an environmental group that has pushed for more stringent PFAS cleanup standards.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/00/3b/d076110744ac924180b42165f752/la-photos-1staff-464708-na-0904-environmental-hazards-perris-02-gem.jpg"></figure>Forever chemicals' spread<p>Nationwide, the chemicals have been found at 401 current and former military bases. When testing was conducted off-base, the pollutants were found in 1 in 4 wells and water systems, according to a 2018 Pentagon report to Congress.</p><p>Among them is the well at Ruben Mendez's home in the Inland Empire.</p><p>Mendez said he had no reason to think something was wrong with his well water until Air Force officials knocked on his door a few years ago.</p><p>They said, We spilled something, and you need to stop drinking the water for a while, Mendez said in an interview on the front porch of his peach-colored home.</p><p>In 1993, when the Mendez family built the ranch-style home that Ruben, 64, and his 91-year-old mother now share, they settled on property about a mile southeast of March Air Reserve Base. They had a private well dug more than 400 feet down, and for years authorities came every few months to test the water. Mendez said he attributed these visits to his homes proximity to the base.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/60/35/5e7257de456aa0e99ca616b4e491/la-photos-1staff-464708-na-0904-environmental-hazards-perris-07-gem.jpg"></figure><p>In 2016, after the EPA set its health advisory, officials abruptly told the Mendezes and another family nearby to stop drinking the water.</p><p>We thought we had nice, clean water, Mendez said.</p><p>At that point, the Air Force immediately contacted the two private well owners, provided them with bottled water and advised them not to use the well for any consumption purposes, Air Force spokesman Mark Kinkade said.</p>Rubens younger brother Otto Mendez, 62, who lives 60 miles away in Downey, said he wonders whether the contaminated water contributed to his brothers health problems -- arthritis, pain in his bones, hip problems and dramatic weight loss. Otto said doctors couldnt figure out what was wrong.Maybe that chemical had something to do with it, Otto said.<p>The Air Force delivered free five-gallon jugs of water to the Mendez home for more than two years. In 2018, it paid to have the house connected to the municipal water system. Ruben Mendez said he now pays $100 a month for water he used to get for free.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4a/94/2997eaf140d59dc8402b1e50b04f/la-photos-1staff-464708-na-0904-environmental-hazards-perris-04-gem.jpg"></figure><p>The toxic plume that spread from the base has also made its way into the public drinking-water system.</p><p>The Eastern Municipal Water District, which supplies a swath of the Inland Empire that is home to some 825,000 people  from Temecula to Moreno Valley and Perris to Hemet  closed one of its large supply wells in 2016 when the EPA set its new health advisory level for the chemicals.</p><p>We took that well out of service the same day, said Lanaya Alexander, the water districts senior director of water resources planning.</p><p>But the chemicals had spread further south. In February, after a second well tested above Californias notification level, the district shut it down too.</p>An emerging health threat<p>Often referred to as forever chemicals, PFAS can persist indefinitely in the ground and water, be absorbed into people's blood and accumulate in their bodies for years.</p><p>Some states and public health advocates say PFAS are harmful at much lower levels than the federal health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion. California requires state regulators to be notified at levels as low as 5.1 parts per trillion.</p><p>In January, a new state law will mandate that customers be told if any of the chemicals are detected.</p><p>Contamination from these chemicals come from many sources, not just aircraft foam. They were widely used in commercial products like nonstick pans, waterproof clothing and food packaging.</p><p>In Southern California, a major source of the pollutants is believed to be chrome-plating factories.</p><p>Most vulnerable are mothers and young children, whose reproductive and developmental health can be altered by even tiny amounts of the chemicals being passed to fetuses during pregnancy and to nursing infants through breast milk.</p><p>Since only small amounts can be absorbed through the skin, the greatest risk of exposure is from drinking contaminated water.</p><p>Firefighting foam is considered a major contributor to the contamination, because it contains high concentrations of PFAS. Developed by the Navy and 3M Co., the chemicals create a film that cools burning aircraft fuel and blankets flammable vapors.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/49/3b/9b9374114b4d8ff292294a41b391/la-na-pol-aqueous-film-foaming-foam-26.JPG"></figure><p>Because of concerns about PFAS contamination, the Pentagon promised in 2016, after the EPA issued its health advisory, that it would phase out use of the foam. It has halted its use in training, but continues to apply it in aircraft fires.</p><p>Outrage over PFAS contamination has been building in the Midwest and on the East Coast for years, where companies like 3M, DuPont and its spin-off, the Chemours Co.</p> ,<p> which made the chemicals, have sought to <a>downplay their health risks</a>.</p><p>New Hampshire has set some of the toughest PFAS drinking-water limits in the country. Pennsylvania has tested the blood of residents in heavily-affected areas to measure their exposure. New Mexicos attorney general sued the Air Force this year to compel the military to pay for the cleanup of two contaminated bases.</p><p>But in California, which state regulators say does not have any companies that manufactured PFAS, the scope of the contamination is only beginning to be understood.</p><p>California regulators have launched a multi-part investigation, focusing first on more than 600 drinking-water wells located within one or two miles of commercial airports and municipal landfills, where discarded household items release the chemicals.</p><p>They plan to widen their search in the coming months, sampling water from wells near military bases and manufacturing plants.</p><p>Were going to take it case by case, said Dan Newton of the state Water Resources Control Board. Where we find hot spots, we may chase those out further to identify plumes or areas of concern.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4f/fb/d019cc4149e6a5262ed9cc40e089/la-na-pol-aqueous-film-foaming-foam-27-copy.jpg"></figure>High levels found, but not enough testing<p>One of the California bases with the highest levels of on-base contamination, Edwards Air Force Base, has carried out little testing off-site.</p><p>A vast aircraft testing facility in the high desert north of Lancaster, Edwards has 24 contaminated sites where firefighting foam was sprayed heavily.</p><p>At a training site where firefighters practiced dousing flames with the toxic foam, the contamination level in soil samples reached 18,000 parts per trillion, more than 250 times higher than the EPA threshold, according to a contractors 2018 report to the Air Force.</p><p>Tests of the bases drinking water did not show high readings. Still, the environmental testing company hired by the military called for further investigation into whether chemicals from the foam were leaching into the groundwater, noting at least 39 off-base water supply wells are within a 4-mile radius of a contaminated site at Edwards.</p><p>Federal and state regulators agreed that more testing was necessary.</p><p>In March, the EPA complained in an email to base authorities that while the base was conducting limited testing, it had made no commitment to ensure the nature and extent of  PFAS contamination is investigated.</p><p>Californias Department of Toxic Substances Control recommended in a July 22 letter to base officials that the Air Force expand its testing to include off-base wells.</p><p>Sanford Nax, a spokesman for the agency, acknowledged that regulators were concerned about the limited nature of the sampling.</p><p>The Air Force is preparing to do further on-base testing next month near the base's northern boundary, it said in a statement. None of the 24 contaminated sites found at the base to date are in close proximity to any on-base or off-base drinking water wells, it said.</p><p>If future sampling finds contaminated drinking water that exceeds the EPA recommended level, we will immediately provide alternate drinking water to impacted residences and facilities and begin working with the community and state regulators, the statement added.</p><p>Other bases have even higher PFAS contamination.</p><p>At China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, a massive Navy testing facility and airfield near Ridgecrest, groundwater samples in 2017 turned up PFAS levels of 8 million parts per trillion, the highest in California.</p><p>Sampling in 2017 at Naval Base Ventura County found PFAS contamination of 1.08 million parts per trillion.</p><p>And near San Francisco, at Naval Air Station Alameda, the levels reached 336,000 parts per trillion, while at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, a shuttered base in Orange County, samples were as high as 770,000 parts per trillion.</p><p>Recently released Pentagon documents obtained through a public records request by the Environmental Working Group, an environmental advocacy group, showed three more bases in California with elevated contamination levels.</p><p>They include Joint Forces Training Base, a California National Guard airfield in Los Alamitos, and Ft. Hunter Liggett, an Army training base in southern Monterey County.

The Air Force has not reimbursed it for this expense, said Evan Jacobs, a California American Water spokesman.</p><p>In a statement, the Air Force said, "Congress has provided no authority" to pay for constructing the facility, but that it was in negotiations with the company to pay for its operation costs.</p><p>In a sign of growing frustration with the Defense Department, the company has filed a property damage claim against the Air Force  a first step before a lawsuit.</p><p>Tim Miller, California American Waters senior director of water quality, warned regulators at a meeting of the State Water Resources Control Board last spring that the Mather PFAS plume could grow.</p><p>"The risk of PFAS contamination continuing to spread in the groundwater basin underneath the city of Rancho Cordova is increasing," he said.</p><p>If no one acted to prevent it, Miller said, the chemicals could leach into five more drinking-water wells within the next five years.</p><p>The pollutants have already reached Bethany Slavic Missionary Church, which is housed in a former health club a mile from Mather.</p><p>A deep well on the property supplies the Pentecostal church with its drinking water and is used to fill an outdoor swimming pool for baptisms.</p><p>Ciuriuc, one of the church's founders, said he had no idea the Air Force was regularly testing the well for PFAS  or that the tests showed the contaminant level had risen from 14 parts per trillion in 2016 to 50 parts per trillion two years later.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3c/50/ca4121a84a10b0c5343608b310db/la-photos-freelance-contract-464346-na-pol-environmental-hazards10-mw.JPG"></figure><p>When the well was tested again in March, the chemicals had climbed to 59 parts per trillion, according to a letter disclosing the results the Air Force sent to the churchs pastor, Adam Bondaruk.</p><p>The sample results are below the United States Environmental Protection Agency Lifetime Health Advisory level of 70 parts per trillion, said the letter, a copy of which was provided by the church. The Air Force is committed to protecting human health and the environment.</p><p>Since the letter made no recommendations to limit use of the well for drinking water, the church initially took no action.

Everywhere there is evidence of consumption  kombucha bottles, cardboard delivery packages, plastic water bottles, toothpaste tubes, vitamin bottles</p>,<p> and plastic bags.</p><p>"Our garbage tells our story," said recycling coordinator Kreigh Hampel. "It drives home how disposable our lives are."</p><p>Not long ago, these byproducts of a throw</p>-<p>away lifestyle found a market in China, allowing Americans to toss their garbage in recycling bins with a seemingly clean conscience. But in late 2017, China imposed a stringent ban on imports of certain scrap papers and plastics, creating a glut of material and roiling the global recycling industry.</p><p>Now, as still more Asian nations prepare to follow China's lead, California's recycling industry is struggling, posing hard choices for a state that prides itself on its image as an environmental beacon. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-13/recycling-crisis-bottle-can-deposit-redemption" target="_blank">A big hit came this month</a> when RePlanet, Californias largest operator of recycling redemption centers, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-08-05/recycling-center-business-replanet-shuts-down" target="_blank">shut down and laid off 750 employees</a>.</p>Both <p>Consumers and industry </p> alike <p>will need to brace for big changes.</p><p>The Chinese ban and everything else in the last couple of years made us realize we are living in a pretend world of 'wishcycling,' said Roland Geyer, an industrial ecology professor at UC Santa Barbara</p> .<p> What weve tried hasnt worked.</p> Demise of recycling poses hard choices for California consumers<p>To go beyond "wishcycling"  the assumption that everything in the blue bin gets recycled  consumers will need to change their purchase practices, avoiding single-use containers and packaging that have no recycling value, </p>say <p>experts </p> say.<p> Industries that produce these products will need to be held responsible for their life-cycle impacts, possibly in the form of legislative mandates.</p><p>"Weve always recognized that, for many materials, were going to have to have producer responsibility,"said Mark Murray, executive director of Californians Against Waste, a Sacramento</p>-based<p> conservation group. "That idea is not new."</p><p>China started banning certain scrap imports partly because of complaints that the United States was shipping "contaminated" and poorly sorted recyclables, and also because of internal changes in the Chinese economy and waste management systems.</p><p>The shift has prompted<a href="https://www.apnews.com/3d3d86a09b9647b795295e77355877db" target="_blank"> increased investment in U.S. recycling plants </a>to fill the void. Nonetheless, scrap waste is piling up in warehouses and parking lots. Some is ending up in waterways, oceans, landfills and incinerators. In nearly all cases, waste disposal is more expensive.</p><p>Its had a significant impact, said Navnit Padival, senior engineer at the Los Angeles County Sanitation District. The United States and the world over have been affected by Chinas ban.</p><p>The result: </p> Companies <p>that once turned a profit selling our used yogurt containers and water bottles now have accumulating piles of garbage and no place to sell it.</p><p>Within Los Angeles County alone, three recycling centers and two materials recovery facilities have </p>shuttered  closed <p>since 2018, and as profits dwindle, many are operating at a loss and potentially risk closure.</p><p>About a decade back, the Burbank </p>Recycling  Recycle <p>Center earned roughly $50,000 a month on recycled materials. In the </p>past  last <p>year, the value of recycled goods plunged so low </p>they were that it was<p> paying as much as $40,000 a month to outlets overseas just to get rid of </p>it  the material. <p>Its gotten so expensive that the center is resorting to the landfill.</p><p>At the recycling center, the warehouse is dominated by a pile of material roughly the size of a house, which slowly moves onto a conveyor belt to begin an elaborate, multi-step sorting process. The machine song of the sorting line drowns out all other noises, as some 25 workers sort through the sun-faded plastic and broken bottles.</p><p>We just dont have a market for a lot of this stuff, Hampel said. </p>Kreigh Hampel, Recycling Coordinator for the City of Burbank.<p> Were sending </p> balesbails <p>of plastic up to our landfill now and just burying it.</p><p>A collapsed market also translates to higher rates for residents  </p> because <p>the trash haulers who pick up blue bins at the curb rely on </p>the <p>profits from selling them to operate. Without that revenue, haulers are having to raise their prices. Republic Services, which provides hauling services nationally and within Los Angeles, has begun raising its average $4-$6 weekly rate by as much as $1.50 </p> a <p>week in some places.</p><p>While the industry stalls, residents and businesses are consuming and generating more waste than ever. In 2014, Los Angeles County generated approximately 22 million tons of waste. By 2018, that number </p> had<p> climbed to 30 million tons.</p><p>Some see the current crisis as a wake-up call about the realities  and limitations  of recycling.</p><p>Even during the days when China absorbed the bulk of American recyclables, much of what </p>they  it <p>purchased wasn't actually recycled. After more desirable materials were gleaned, some of it was burned or </p>landfilled sent to landfills, according to  said <p>David Colgan, director of communications at UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.</p><p>Even when a product is recycled, </p>Geyer <p>said </p> Geyer, the UC Santa Barbara professor, <p>its eventual destination is still a landfill. In the heyday of recycling, millions of tons of garbage still went to the landfill, and the production of virgin plastics increased at a steady rate alongside recycled products. Between 2010 and 2018, 36 landfills in California expanded and a new one opened.</p><p>At the same time, the number of CRV recycling centers  where the public can recycle bottles and cans in exchange for a refund  has been steadily declining statewide, with 996 closing since 2015,</p> according to  said <p>Lance Klug, a spokesman for CalRecycle, a state agency.</p><p>The environmental cost comes in the form </p> of<p> methane </p>gasses  gases <p>emitted by landfills</p>,<p> and the plastics and waste that end up in waterways, oceans and wildlands, </p>negatively impacting often harming<p> fish and wildlife.</p><p>Plastic is already everywhere in the environment by now, and it will get more and more pervasive in higher concentrations and higher levels, </p>said <p>Geyer </p> said.<p>Despite imminent gridlock, some say the situation calls for reform, not abandonment, of the recycling industry. </p> The <p>Los Angeles County </p> Department of<p> Public Works is unveiling a campaign to encourage </p>the public  people <p>to keep their recyclables well-sorted and clean, which will reduce contamination and make the recycling process more efficient.</p><p>A lot of people have built up good recycling habits in recent years, and we want them to keep up those habits, said Coby Skye, assistant deputy director for environmental programs at the Public Works Department.</p><p>Still, researchers and environmental advocates emphasize that simple changes to </p>our <p>recycling habits wont be enough. The recycling industry itself leaves a footprint resulting from its industrial processes, and even at its most efficient, </p> it <p>doesn't outweigh the waste produced.</p><p>We need to stop looking at recycling as a primary solution to our waste problem, said Colgan, of UCLA.</p><p>A focus on<b> </b>recycling also shifts the burden to consumers, he said, while ignoring other avenues of sustainability, such as production and re-use.</p><p>In California, multiple reform bills are moving through the legislative process, including <a>Assembly Bill 792</a>, which would target beverage container producers by enforcing minimum requirements for recycled materials in production, and <a>AB 1080</a>, </p> known as <p>the California Circular Economy and Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, which would require that all single-use plastic products and packaging products in California </p>are  be <p>recyclable or compostable by January 2030.</p><p>Industry lobbyists have fended off previous legislative attempts to regulate single-use containers</p>,<p> and may do so again.</p><p>"The transformational question before policymakers is 'who should be responsible?'" said Murray, adding that manufacturers want to maintain the status quo </p>since  because <p>they profit from continuing to buy cheap virgin materials</p>,<p> with no disposal obligations.</p><p>In the recycling industry, strong markets remain for many goods, such as paper, cardboard, and aluminum. But there's a growing volume of plastics and mixed plastics  things like plastic-coated cartons or potato chip bags that no longer have a recycling value</p>,<p> or never had one in the first place.</p><p>The path forward is uncertain.</p><p>"The U.S. is having a come-to-Jesus moment," said Hampel, Burbank's recycling coordinator. "Recycling is not going to undo the damage done by consumption."</p>Times staff writer Alex Wigglesworth contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The bottom just fell out with RePlanet, that's what happened.</p><p><a href="http://www.replanet.com/" target="_blank">The company,</a> which ran redemption centers across the state, shut its doors Aug. 5</p>last Monda<p>, causing ripple effects down to the street level. Californians often turned to RePlanet to redeem deposit fees placed on beverage containers, a </p> nickelnickle<p> or dime, depending on the size of the container.</p><p>"Many people rely on getting that nickel or dime back, and when you can't get that back it hurts Californians, particularly those living on the lower end of the income scale," said Jenna Abbott, executive director of Protect CRV, a recycling industry trade group.</p><p>The collapse of Re</p>p<p>Planet has also sparked debate on California's entire beverage container recycling program, whether it can be revived and whether lawmakers and a state agency, <a href="https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/" target="_blank">CalRecycle</a>, moved quickly enough in the face of mounting problems.</p><p>"There's no question that CalRecycle's inaction is responsible for the demise of redemption centers in this state, Court said. If they simply paid them more to stay open until we had a longer-term solution, we would not be in this crisis.</p><p>Redemption centers are crucial to implementation of a 1986 state law, informally known as the "California Bottle Bill," which aims to reduce litter and excessive consumption of natural resources. Under the law, the state pays subsidies to redemption centers, including a processing payment to cover the cost of containers they collect  including glass and plastic containers  that are more expensive to process than the raw material is worth. The payments are calculated using a formula that takes into account national economic data.</p><p>But two years ago, China started refusing to accept many kinds of U.S. recyclables, contributing to the collapse of recycling markets. The declining price of commodities sent the formula dipping into negative territory, said Lance Klug, a spokesman for CalRecycle.</p><p>That started to decrease processing payments just as the recycling industry started to feel the effect of the global market decline, he said.</p><p>Mark Murray, director of environmental lobbying group Californians Against Waste, said problems with the container recycling program are very much legislative.</p><p>It is a statutory problem, not a CalRecycle problem, he said. CalRecycle does not have the authority to fix this.</p><p>Beverage manufacturers pay CalRecycle a processing payment </p> that <p>is intended to help the redemption center compensate for collected container that dont have scrap values. While the law conceptually promises that, there are outdated provisions of the law such that that's not actually happening, Murray said.</p><p>RePlanet's demise took many by shock, despite the chaos roiling recycling markets. The company said in a statement it would work with creditors after concluding that operating redemption centers was was no longer financially sustainable. Representatives did not return requests for comment.</p><p>Though California's troubles have been driven by global market forces, the state has felt the pain more acutely than many others, some advocates say.</p><p>There's a much more responsive system in other states, Court said. It's largely because the best states with the highest redemption rates don't rely on recycling centers as much as they do retailers.</p><p>Eight of the nine other states that have bottle deposit programs require that beverage retailers, in addition to redemption centers, accept empty containers for recycling, Court said. Some of the most successful states also have higher bottle deposits.</p><p>In Oregon, the deposit is 10 cents, and the program is run by a cooperative of beverage distributors.</p><p>Oregon reported a beverage container recycling rate of 90% in 2018, higher than California's 76% </p> thethat <p>same year.</p><p>CalRecycle said it has tried to adjust. The agency engaged in emergency rule-making each year since 2016 to amend the processing payment calculation in an attempt to help soften the blow. Any additional increase, Klug said, would require a change in statute.</p><p>Newsom, in his most recent budget, also approved $5 million in temporary assistance for the states lowest-volume recyclers. About 416 redemption centers will receive an additional $1,000-per-month subsidy, Klug said.</p><p>"Moving forward, I think this is going to be viewed as part of a larger problem that requires a collective response in California," he said.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Others, however, argued that the countys plodding response to a hazardous materials release exposed glaring flaws in government procedures and warrants reforms.</p><p>One hundred ninety-four days after the release, we are now at the point where we're telling people it's </p> OK<p> to eat different fruits and vegetables, said Tony Semenza, a resident and member of the county oversight committee. The process is flawed. This should have been done much quicker.</p><p>County officials, for their part, promised there would be consequences for Martinez Refining, which did not immediately notify the proper authorities </p>immediately<p> after the hazardous materials release, prompting regulators to find out through complaints from residents.</p><p>These results do not excuse the Martinez Refining Co. for the lack of notification at the onset of this incident, said Matt Kaufmann, deputy health director. While this does bring some relief in terms of long-term health impacts to our community  the lack of timely notification negated our ability as health officials to protect our community, including those most vulnerable, namely the medically compromised, the elderly and the children within our community.</p><p>The county health department has referred two violations to the Contra Costa County district attorneys office  one for failure to notify the proper authorities of a hazardous materials release and one for illicit discharges into the county stormwater system.</p><p>The FBI and thje U.S. Environmental Protection Agency </p>has<p> have also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-26/fbi-investigating-hazardous-fallout-from-bay-area-refinery">launched a joint investigation</a> into the Martinez Refining release, speaking with residents who may have been exposed to the toxic fallout.</p><p>They have not filled us in on details of that investigation, Kaufmann said. We're really not privy to </p>what's been<p> what they're looking at or who they're talking to.</p>Beyond confirming the investigation is ongoing, An FBI spokesperson confirmed that the investigation is ongoing<p> but declined to comment further.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Residents, particularly the most vulnerable, were urged to stay indoors; others were advised to wear high-quality, N95 masks outside, an unwelcome reminder of those frightening and uncertain days of the </p>Covid  COVID<p> pandemic. </p><p>Flights were temporarily grounded or facing major delays at critical transportation hubs, including in Philadelphia and New York City, because of low visibility. School field trips and</p> recess and<p> outdoor recess </p> were canceled <p>for millions of students in affected states as concerns lingered about when the smoke would lift. </p><p>According to AirNow, which offers real-time tracking of AQI, Maryland and Washington, D.C., were hotspots for polluted air Thursday, after the smoke began to travel southward from parts of the upper Northeast. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, which covers D.C. along with parts of Maryland and Virginia, issued its first code purple alert, triggered when fine particulates reach very unhealthy levels  above 200 AQI  for everyone.</p><p>There was somewhat of a windshift to bring that plume down to the south overnight last night into this morning, said Cody Ledbetter, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Air quality alerts have been issued as far south as the Carolinas. The National Weather Service also <a href="https://origin.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd">said</a> that air quality is likely to decline in Georgia and Alabama.</p><p>In Washington, D.C., where the air quality level was 273 as of 1 </p>PM  p.m.<p> Eastern </p> on<p> Thursday and residents shared photos of <a href="https://twitter.com/sbaker517/status/1666788855767355396">a gloomy, apocalyptic capital early,</a> the White House <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-host-thousands-white-house-pride-party-2023-06-08/">postponed</a> its Pride event</p> Thursday night<p>, which was expected to draw thousands of people, on the South Lawn </p> on<p> Thursday night to Saturday. The Washington Nationals postponed their game Thursday against the Arizona Diamondbacks to June 22, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nationals/status/1666828850423029761">the team said on Twitter.</a></p><p>In New York City, which for several days running ranked No. 1 for the world's most polluted city as indexes climbed above 400, residents woke up to hazy skies again, but air quality levels across the state appeared to improve. By Thursday afternoon, counties across New York had dropped to unhealthy levels below 200  still above normal, but better than previous days. </p><p>Officials were urging residents to stay indoors, noting the conditions could change rapidly. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said that approximately 1 million N95-style masks would be made available at state-owned facilities. The Belmont Stakes, a major horse racing event on Long Island, could be canceled this weekend if air quality levels </p>crept  creep <p>back up above 200, </p>Hochhul  Hochul <p>said.</p><p>Residents in New Jersey and Pennsylvania  where hazardous conditions hit record levels in some areas overnight  battled another day of bad air, though dangerous conditions were dropping off throughout the day as the smoke drifted south.</p><p>The smoke blanketing the region stems from Canada, which has had an explosive start to its wildfire season with nearly 400 active blazes scorching forests around the country, about 150 of which are in the eastern province of Quebec. High temperatures and dry conditions, along with lightning, ignited the provinces fires, which swelled over the weekend and floated south across the border with the windflow.</p><p>President Biden has spoken with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada to offer federal support.</p><p>We've deployed more than 600 U.S. firefighters, support personnel, and equipment to support Canada as they respond to record wildfires  events that are intensifying because of the climate crisis, </p>President <p>Biden said on Twitter.</p><p>An area of low pressure stalled over New England is directing the airflow from Canada, meteorologists have said.

"Settling this case without litigation is huge. This is like flying to the moon or something."</p><p>At the center of the matter are two adjacent properties along the 27900 block of Pacific Coast Highway, where enforcement officials say the homeowners and their predecessors violated the Coastal Act by obscuring public accessways, or easements, from the highway to the beach. </p><p>"Escondido Beach means 'Hidden Beach' in Spanish, and the lack of public access here kept it hidden from many people that could not find a nearby public trail to the beach, or even a public parking spot, over the decades," commission staff wrote </p>in a<p> <a href="https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2023/6/W9.1-9.6/W9.1.-9.6-6-7-23-Report.pdf" target="_blank">in a report</a> ahead of Wednesday's decision.</p><p>The properties are currently owned by Frank Mancuso, former chief executive of Paramount Pictures and MGM, and the family of Don Wildman, founder of Bally Total Fitness. Wildman died in 2018, leaving the property to his heirs. </p><p>But the violations </p> stretch<p> back to the early 1980s, when prior owners Ken and Jeannette Chiate and Marilyn and Roger Wolk wrongly recorded the location of the easement along a steep grade instead of a gently sloped arroyo, according to the report. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9d/97/96c42ced4506bf30405c279bd19f/1302412-me-public-access-escondido-beach-10-brv.jpg"></figure><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/8d/2ec1a1554584911b6640f575daae/1302412-me-public-access-escondido-beach-11-brv.jpg"></figure><p>In the years and decades that followed, lot line adjustments, metal fencing, thick vegetation, paved driveways and other encroachments installed by Chiate and later Wildman further obscured the </p> pathway and <p>parking spaces along Pacific Coast Highway, </p> the report said.<p>"Even if the public knew that the vertical public access easement was here, they could not physically use that easement," </p> enforcement analyst <p>Robert Moddelmog </p> told<p> the commission.</p><p>Wildman purchased his property in the mid-1980s, and Mancuso in 1991. </p><p>Both argued through the 1990s and 2000s that the public accessway should be moved elsewhere, due to the difficulties of building on and improving the recorded easement area, the report said.</p><p>In California, the coastline is considered public land up to the high-tide line.</p><p>"Whenever we see access blocked to this resource that is public, and guaranteed to be public by our laws in California, we want to do our best to protect them," said Laura Walsh, California policy manager for the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation, which supported the decision.</p><p>"We feel, really, a sense of injustice when a legal, public resource that's ours is violated, and that's what happened here in a very convoluted way," she said. "We think it's amazing that different entities were able to come together on a reasonable solution."</p><p>The public has not won a new highway-to-beach access point in Malibu since 2013, when the commission <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/westside/la-me-malibu-beach-access-20150703-story.html">secured an opening</a> from Carbon Beach property owner Lisette Ackerberg after a decades-long struggle. That access point opened in 2015.</p><p>Music mogul David Geffen similarly spent years attempting to block public access near his Carbon Beach compound before <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-feb-15-me-geffen15-story.html">settling with the commission in 2007</a>.</p><p>"If you say the word 'Malibu' to anybody in the world, they think of going to the beach, they think of surfing and beach life and picnicking and all the stuff that goes along with the California coast," Haage said. "It's just so ironic that there's so few access points, and every single one, we've had to fight and fight and fight for."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4d/e5/83c6485846d09e0d9afdfefbc60e/1302412-me-public-access-escondido-beach-4-brv.jpg"></figure><p>Escondido Beach, which overlooks Point Dume, is home to many wealthy residents who have long enjoyed access to the secluded spot. Nearby neighbors include <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-01-28/billionaire-david-saperstein-ask-115-million-for-malibu-mansion">billionaire David Saperstein</a> and Jay-Z and Beyonce, whose <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-19/beyonce-jay-z-malibu-mansion-200-million-record">$200 million home purchase in Paradise Cove</a> last month shattered California price records.</p><p>Geoffrey's is about a half-mile </p> east of<p> the easement. Paradise Cove Cafe is a quarter-mile </p> west<p> and charges <a href="https://www.paradisecovemalibu.com/parking-info/" target="_blank">up to $65 for beach parking</a>.</p><p>The easement "really reduces the length you have to walk, particularly with gear" such as kayaks and surfboards, Walsh said. "And also, the parking that's going to be created at the trailhead is going to be free, so it's more equitable access in that sense." </p><p>Under the agreement, the families will remove the</p> ir<p> encroachments and restore the public's easement. </p> They will also<p> install five new public parking spots, a public restroom and signage along the highway. </p><p>The Wildmans will construct the accessway and parking lot, among other improvements, at an estimated cost of $3 million, the report says. Mancuso will remove an unpermitted driveway, provide land for the easement and pay a $600,000 fine.</p><p>The estimated public value of the resolution is at least $4 million, commission staff said, but the avoided cost</p>s<p> to taxpayers is likely much higher.</p><p>Alan Block, an attorney for Mancuso, said the violations were not disclosed when he purchased the property. The circumstances have been a burden, he said.</p><p>"The Mancuso family has never done anything on the property whatsoever  they bought it the way it is  but they understand the law, and they've worked out an agreement and they hope the commission will approve it," Block said ahead of Wednesday's vote. </p><p>Wildman's heirs similarly inherited the violations. Susan Hori, an attorney for the family, said they were pleased with the decision.</p><p>"We are very happy that the commission did support and approve the resolution," Hori said. "And we're very appreciative of the time that it took from staff to come and work with us on that resolution."</p><p>But while the victory is significant for the public, it is all the more meaningful due to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-sea-level-rise-california-coast/">changing coastal conditions</a> driven by sea level rise, erosion and other </p> consequences<p> of climate change. </p><p>"We are in a really big hurry to open up as much access as possible because of sea level rise and climate change," Haage said. "People need beaches more than ever, and we want to get people out there while there's still a beach to go to. ... The future of access in California is uncertain, so we're trying to do all we can now to protect it going forward."</p><p>Commissioner Linda Escalante spoke in favor of the agreement during the meeting, and said it "helps restore the legacies of these two families, who have embraced their responsibility as stewards of this public trust land that they share with Californians." </p><p>"In the 35 years I've lived in L.A. County, I've never set foot on this beach before, so I can't wait until I'm able to do it while my knees still allow it," she said. </p><p>The easement could open to the public as soon as 2024, pending necessary permits and construction, officials said. </p><p>Even on a cloudy day last week, it was easy to see the area's appeal. The stately homes towered high above the bluff; quiet waves crashed along the shore. </p><p>Tom Pabst, a neighbor, was the only other person on the beach that day. He said he hadn't heard about the plan, but that he was "absolutely" in favor of it.</p><p>"This is a beautiful beach," he said. "The more public access, the better."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Massive tongues of unhealthy air extended as far as Virginia and Indiana, affecting millions of people.</p><p>I can taste the air, Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, N.Y., which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, made him a bit dizzy. </p><p>In Baltimore, where officials warned residents to stay indoors when possible, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk around Ft. McHenry, the national monument overlooking the Patapsco River. The air hung thick over the water, obscuring the horizon as distant ships pushed slowly through the haze.</p><p>I walked outside this morning and it was like a waft of smoke, said Funk, who said the couple had considered skipping the walk but wanted some exercise. The two planned to stay inside later Wednesday.</p><p>Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the nation's worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated very quickly, exhausting firefighting resources across the country, fire and environmental officials said.</p> Wildfires are getting worse across the globe. How does California compare? <p>Smoke from the blazes in various parts of the country has been drifting into the U.S. since last month but intensified with a recent spate of fires in Quebec, where more than 100 were burning and considered out of control Tuesday. </p><p>The smoke was insane yesterday. I had to close my window because the fresh air just smelled like campfire, said Zachary Kamel, 36, of Montreal. </p><p>Quebec Premier Franois Legault has said the province has the capacity to fight about 40 fires at the moment  and the usual reinforcements that could be called in from other provinces have already been strained by fires in Nova Scotia and elsewhere. </p><p>Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center spokesperson Jennifer Kamau said more than 950 firefighters and other personnel have already arrived from the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and more will be arriving soon. </p><p>The largest town in Northern Quebec  Chibougamau, population about 7,500  was evacuated Tuesday, after another Quebec community was left to burn Monday, drawing the ire of local residents. Legault said firefighters had no choice because the flames around the hamlet of Clova were too intense to send in water bombers. No homes had burned as of Tuesday. </p><p>Eastern Quebec got some rain Wednesday, but Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense.</p><p>U.S. National Weather Service meteorologist Zach Taylor said the current weather pattern in the central and eastern U.S. is essentially funneling in the smoke. Some rain should help clear the air somewhat in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend or early next week, though more thorough relief will come from containing or extinguishing the fires, he noted.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/40/58/1a99261146efa9e4e28a50bbf517/canada-wildfires-new-york-32469.jpg"></figure><p>Across the border, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned the public to prepare for this over the long haul," New York City Mayor Eric Adams told residents to limit outdoor activities as much as possible. </p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration paused some flights bound for LaGuardia Airport and slowed planes to Newark Liberty because the smoke was limiting visibility. The smoke also was contributing to delayed arrivals at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.</p><p>Schools in multiple states canceled sports and other outdoor activities, shifting recess and lunch time inside. Live horse racing was canceled Wednesday and Thursday at Delaware Park in Wilmington. Organizers of Global Running Day, a virtual 5K and celebration of running, posted a warning on their website advising participants to monitor the air quality in their cities and change their running plans accordingly.</p> Wildfires getting worse globally, and governments are unprepared, U.N. report says<p>Some political demonstrations </p>in spots from Manhattan to Harrisburg, Pa.,<p> were moved indoors or postponed, and striking Hollywood writers were pulled off picket lines in the New York metropolitan area. </p><p>Sitting in a Brooklyn park with a black mask on her face, nanny Meagan Bobb said she was surprised by how bad the air was. </p><p>The little girl was coughing, and I was having problems breathing when I was walking around, so were looking to go inside somewhere soon, Bobb said. </p><p>The smoke was a particular worry for people such as Vicki Burnett, 67, who has asthma and has had serious bouts with bronchitis. </p><p>After taking her dogs out Wednesday morning in Farmington Hills, Mich., Burnett said, I came in and started coughing and hopped back into bed. </p><p>Still, she stressed that she's concerned for Canadians, not just herself. </p><p>Its unfortunate, and Im having some problems for it, but there should be help for them, she said.</p>Peltz reported from New York and Gillies from Toronto.

Buy some air purifiers. Put on that KN95 mask. Just because you cant see the threat doesnt mean its not there.</p>This is just some of the wisdom <p>West Coasters who have long lived with the danger of wildfires offered </p> some words of wisdom to <p>their East Coast counterparts Wednesday, as residents along the Eastern seaboard faced another dizzying day of hazy skies </p> amid <p>smoke and air pollution from wildfires burning in Canada.</p><p>Tens of millions of Americans were <a href="https://www.weather.gov/">under air quality alerts</a>, stretching from parts of western Missouri to New York, from Maine to South Carolina, where particulate levels were expected to enter unhealthful territory and many residents experienced the scratchy throats and irritated eyes and lungs that wildfire smoke can cause.</p><p>By afternoon, the <a href="https://www.iqair.com/us/world-air-quality-ranking" target="_blank">IQAir World Air Quality Index</a> ranked New York City No. 1 for the worst air quality on the planet for the second straight day, ahead of global cities </p> such as <p>New Delhi, </p>India,<p> where such conditions are more common. </p><p>The air quality index in New York continued to deteriorate </p> as the day went onWednesday<p>, </p>climbing soaring<p> from below 200 </p> to above 400 by late afternoon,in the morning to 413 by 4:30 p.m. Eastern time 324<p> according to AirNow.gov, which offers real-time tracking of AQI. </p> New York City Mayor Eric Adams said  in a news conference Wednesday evening that at 5 p.m.,  Eastern the AQI had hit 484, "the highest level index of our knowledge since the '60s." <p>Values of 301 or higher are considered hazardous, </p> a level at which<p> the Environmental Protection Agency warns that everyone is more likely to be affected, spurring a health warning of emergency conditions. </p> Canada wildfires are leading to air-quality alerts in the U.S. Here's why there is so much smoke The conditions were predicted to worsen into Thursday, with a reprieve expected Friday, but Adams warned that the situation is changing daily.  "Smoke predictability that far out is low," he said. "We cannot provide guidance more than a day in advance at this point."  He continued to advise <p>vulnerable residents, including older New Yorkers, those with heart and breathing problems and children, to stay indoors and wear high-quality </p>KN95 <p>masks if they needed to venture outside. </p> Gov. Kathy Hochul said that approximately 1 million N95-style masks would be made available at state-owned facilities. New York City's <p><a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSchools/status/1666387607264059392?s=20">public schools,      which        were open  </a></p>  Wednesday and kept students indoors, will be closed Thursday because of a previously scheduled closure, Adams said. Beaches would remain closed because of poor visibility, and other outdoor activities around the city would also be canceled, he said, adding that drivers were urged to maintain caution on the roads.  "Our city is strong and resilient," Adams said. "We have faced crisis before, and we will get through this together."  Hochul on Wednesday <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mT0hfR6tYoc" target="_blank">warned residents</a> </p> statewide that the situation was a "crisis" that could last  stretch for days. "This is typically a West Coast phenomena," she said, emphasizing that people need to stay indoors whenever possible.  Canadian wildfire smoke spreads hazardous haze through northeastern U.S.<p>The sky in New York grew more ominous and darker </p> during the day<p> as <a href="https://twitter.com/nymetrowx/status/1666479008899293187">smoke overpowered much of the city</a>, </p>and <p>shroud</p> ing<p> the five boroughs in a deep, orange glow </p> and disrupting activities<p>, </p> from professional sports to theater. <p>Wednesday night's <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceBeck4NY/status/1666542242360696835" target="_blank">MLB game between</a> the New York Yankees and the Chicago White Sox was postponed one night after the teams faced off under an ashen sky.

The first two performances of the Free Shakespeare in the Park production of "Hamlet," which takes place in Central Park, were canceled for Thursday and Friday.<p>The Federal Aviation </p> Administration<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1666508927066841088" target="_blank">said on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon</a> that it slowed traffic to and from New York City area airports "due to reduced visibility from wildfire smoke." Philadelphia's airport also was brought to a ground stop, the agency said. </p> New Yorkers said the smell of smoke, similar to that of a campfire, was so overwhelming that they could not step outside without coughing or their eyes burning. Many wore masks as they commuted across the boroughs and shared photos of the ashen sky from landmarks across the city.  Other parts of the state  and nation  were also blighted by hazardous AQI levels<p>. In Binghamton, which registered 400 AQI before midday, visibility was reduced to just one mile.</p> In Washington,  D.C., a haze settled across the National Mall, and the city <p><a href="https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-urges-residents-follow-recommendations-related-code-red-air-quality-alert" target="_blank">was under a "code red" alert,</a></p>  triggered when the AQI breaches 150 and vulnerable groups are at particular risk. Parts of Pennsylvania, where its most-populous city of Philadelphia was also under code red, and New Jersey also saw their AQI surpass 400. <p>The smoke </p> blanketing the East Coast<p> has drifted </p> south <p>from Canada, <a href="https://sopfeu.qc.ca/en/">where nearly      250   149 active wildfires are scorching the forests around the eastern province of Quebec</a>. High temperatures and dry conditions, along with lightning, ignited the fires, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151430/fires-burn-across-quebec">which swelled over the weekend.</a></p><p>An area of low pressure hanging over northern New England is directing the airflow, said John Cristantello, a meteorologist for the National Weather Services New York City office.</p><p>The weather pattern is such that the winds just keep funneling down, from generally north to south, Cristantello said.

We have it every year, but not every place has it so bad," Johnson said, adding the El Dorado fire was especially scary and felt like uncharted territory, even for the most experienced. So Johnson shared tips on Twitter, including advising car owners and homeowners to replace their air filters  now and after the fires. </p><p>"Theyre doing some heavy lifting right now and you want them effective, <a href="https://twitter.com/sherellesays/status/1666269020486791168">Johnson said.</a> Other tips included keeping windows closed, downloading smartphone apps that measure AQI and making sure to stay hydrated, including </p>for<p> your pets. </p><p>S.E. Smith, a Northern California-based writer and journalist, cautioned East Coasters against not taking measures to prepare.</p><p>Wildfire smoke doesn't have to be visible to hurt your lungs, <a href="https://twitter.com/sesmith/status/1666211986848493570" target="_blank">Smith wrote on Twitter.</a> Mask up, use an air purifier, and stay indoors if you can. If you feel tired, cranky, or out of sorts, you are probably feeling the smoke!</p> Some have pointed out the indifference some New Yorkers have to the constant threat West Coast residents face from wildfires every year  until it knocked on their own door.  "It's hard to not notice how wildfire smoke is suddenly very important now that New York City residents are experiencing it," <p><a href="https://twitter.com/KarlBode/status/1666442156343726080" target="_blank">Karl Bode, a Seattle-based writer, said on Twitter</a></p> . "Seattle looked like ...  f mordor for several summers, and I recall a lot of yawning on the part of most new york city brunchlords."  COPY DESK: Please remove if not OK/bjt Others said the issue has also become yet another coastal competition. "Why are New York and California beefing over who has worse wildfire smoke," <p><a href="https://twitter.com/hari_sanil/status/1666536144459186178" target="_blank">     one Twitter user wrote  </a></p> .                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Many are the original scents.</p><p>The aim of the Perfumers Garden is to unlock the mysteries and significance behind the scented flowers of the 17th century French court  yet also remind us that it was no accident that the Versailles Palace was the very place where the job of perfumer was actually invented during that century.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jul-11-cl-21091-story.html" target="_blank">The gardens sprawl</a> in four sections, reimagining <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jun-06-ca-hohenadel6-story.html" target="_blank">the vision of the Sun King</a>, Louis XIV, who wanted his grounds to overflow with the scents of orange blossom, hyacinth, tuberose and jasmine. The king had a practical reason for his obsessions: Following the plague that killed tens of millions of people in the Middle Ages in Europe, people feared that hot water could spread infection. Courtiers instead washed with alcohol rubs and used scents to mask body odors.</p><p>But there was also a diplomatic explanation for these floral obsessions: The kings flower collection served as a means of projecting strength as France became the worlds greatest power in that century.</p><p>Versailles was all about olfactory diplomacy in those days. Flower meant power. Dignitaries were impressed by the exotic flowers because only the king  who was now very powerful  had the money to fund expeditions to bring back exotic blooms, said Giovanni Delu, one of the gardens creators. Its a vegetal cabinet of curiosities."</p><p>Delu said that court-funded expeditions brought back fashionable plants  many of which are featured in the new perfumers gardens  from far-flung South Asia that were nursed or acclimatized in the French soil of Brittany, before being planted in Versailles. Any French nobleman who wanted to replant the prized flowers in his grounds had to first be granted a royal charter or face punishment.</p><p>The stories of Versailles' modern gardeners convey the hidden intrigue, humor, knowledge and mystery the flowers once held. Vibrant historical anecdotes flow freely from their mouths, unveiling an unending trove of historical color. Legend has it that Louis XIV loved the orange blossom, as featured in the garden, so much that his courtiers doused themselves in it to curry favor, at one point causing the king to faint. The scent from some blooms was so intense that the bulbs during this latest venture had to be physically separated in the gardens so that they didn't conspire to produce an undesirable  or equally intoxicating  nasal mix.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/1d/79/8e9bf0e44aa095147bd62854fdaa/france-versailles-perfume-18919.jpg"></figure><p>There were unexpected twists in its conception. A secret garden  with four brick walls  was properly discovered and renovated on the site only recently, sending ripples of excitement among the Versailles gardening staff. Now a sanctuary, it has been adorned with plant species so delicate that only the head gardener has the right to handle them. One 17th century plant now growing there called the firethorn  which leaves a delightful citrus smell on the fingers when rubbed  is prized and feared because it literally catches on fire with the slightest heat. </p><p>Another flower holds secrets in its petals to the love story of Louis XV, an obsessive botanist, and his mistress Madame de Pompadour.</p><p>Louis XV sent botanical species hunters around the world to bring species back, because he and his mistress expressed their love through a shared passion for flowers, gardener Fulvia Grandizio said.</p><p>Grandizio said that Louis XV used one of the worlds very first prototype greenhouses here to nurse his plants  a version of which is on display now. Lovingly caressing the flower with billowing pink-red petals called the calycanthus, Grandizio said nostalgically it was Madame de Pompadours favorite.</p> Plant by plant, flower by flower, he created his own Shangri-La in a Griffith Park nook<p>Yet the garden has its villains. Grandizios eyes narrowed when she spoke of Marie Antoinette. It was bad, she said, that the French-Austrian queen wasn't interested in keeping up the scientific work of the previous king, Louis XV, in exotic flowers  and was taken instead with the heady ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers and unbridled nature.</p><p>Its a real shame when Marie Antoinette arrived at Versailles that she transformed what Louis XV built, the big greenhouse and the plant nursery, into a wild English garden, Grandizio said, with a hint of sadness.</p><p>Despite that claim, Marie Antoinette loved flowers, and was at the heart of the development of perfume.</p><p>Shes not that bad. History has been unkind to her, Grandizio added.</p><p>The Versailles Perfumer's Garden opened on </p>May 30  Tuesday<p>, in collaboration with high-end perfume company Maison Francis Kurkdjian.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

I wasnt sure I wanted to, would have time, would care. I wasnt sure it would ever stop raining.&nbsp;</p><p>After six of the warmest years ever recorded in California, after five years of record wildfires, amid the driest period in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-drought-status-maps-water-usage/">1,200 years</a>, this years record snowfall, its deluge after deluge of violent rain seemed more than the earth could take.&nbsp;</p><p>More water is a net good after long drought, but its also an uneasy bounty. &nbsp;During </p> the<p> storms, our roads washed out, our fields reverted to ancient lakes. Now, more infrastructure will be challenged by the enormous snowmelt that is coming. Hillsides blooming from heavy rains will produce more tinder for the next wildfire. The past winter's storms felt ominous. Now <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-19/return-of-el-nino-would-have-far-reaching-impacts">El Nio could bring</a> another catastrophically wet winter, and climate change could <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/15/us/california-superstorm.html">spark a cycle of superstorms</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The sun is out now and the weather is mild. It may seem that the hard winter should have nothing to do with the work I do in my yard and a nearby community garden. Yet I still hold the downed trees, the homes swept away, the overtopped rivers in my head and in my body.&nbsp;</p><p>Theres a phrase friends of mine have started tossing around: climate grief, our sharp sadness that the planet we knew is in terrible flux, that were losing pieces of it, in real time, in front of our eyes. Climbing over fallen redwoods strewing the road after one of the toughest storms in March, I realized that my climate grief presents as numbness, disgust, fury and despair. It makes me feel as if whatever we do now  whether cleaning our yards, building more resilient wetlands, voting in decent climate policies  will be too little, too late. Im sure Im not alone in this. </p><p>And yet, sweeping back the layers of wet muck and adding some dry straw to the compost, turning over soil, putting in seedlings, watching for weeds, Ive discovered that my anger and my numbness and my grief are actually places I need to get to, to excavate, to dig out, to feel. I need to get into a garden, to work through the grief, to engage it.&nbsp;</p><p>When I garden, I lose, for a few hours at least, the sense that </p>only <p>a catastrophe of losses is upon us. I lose for a while the nagging feeling that there's no hope, that we dont care at all, that were irrevocably broken. Instead, Im setting intentions for dark, microbe-rich soil. I'm discovering things that can survive  some mint, some carrots, a bumper crop of potatoes  and things that volunteer: a cucumber plant, at the edge of the compost. </p><p>The garden cures me of my numbness in other ways too. Because our garden is in our front yard, Im out sharing plants with my neighbors. I dont have enough sun for everything I want to grow, so Ari keeps my potted blueberry bushes in her yard, and we share the fruit. Stephen, who was born outside Kharkiv, has an annual tradition of bringing by special </p>Ukranian Ukrainian<p> tomato starts, a variety that flourishes here despite the Bay Areas summer fog.&nbsp;</p><p>I trade seeds and starts for straw from my chicken coop, which other gardeners like for its nutrients. Dalya, who lives two doors down, wanders by to share insights about cultivating shitakes on loam in a shady side yard. She expounds on the amazing fact of mycelial networks, the great web they build in the soil. </p><p>Above ground, suddenly, I feel less angry or afraid or despairing or alone.&nbsp;</p><p>In a record year after record years, I stop and look at a pea blossom, faint green veins weaving its pale green face. I weed daikon with my daughter and cut fava leaves to make into a pesto with my son. We make a salad out of turnip sprouts. We water our plants with a bucket that captures the now-guiltless flow from our backyard sink.</p><p>We cant save what we dont love. When Im in the garden, I realize that my grief is actually another name for this love, is a call to get out and tend this planet we often feel like were losing before our very eyes. When I do, I remember that my actions matter and that life is stronger and more surprising than I knew, and both of these things help ground me for the road ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether in a plot in a yard or pots in a window, every politically engaged person should have a garden, says my friend Camille Dungy, who just published a book of essays called "Soil: The Story of a Black Mothers Garden</p>." <p>She says the act of tending plants might help us find some of the grace we need to care for one another and the planet writ large. Its part of our job not to miss the enormous beauty thats still left, says my friend, the poet Jane Hirshfield. We still have to celebrate all thats left to save, as marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson puts it.&nbsp;</p><p>The garden reminds us that despite what</p> <p>has been destroyed, what is at risk, we can build, amend, repair. In doing so, we</p>  find delight <p>in whats still here, in what we can still share, together, now. &nbsp;</p>Tess Taylor is an award-winning poet.
