The road had been closed for weeks </p> due to <p>roadway damage</p>s<p> left by the multiple storms of last winter. </p><p>Two other crucial park roads (both of which close every winter) have yet to open.</p><p>The snows have forced many changes and delays as the park</p>s<p> gears up for summer. The cables that climbers use to summit Half Dome, for instance, usually are put in place in May, but that hasn't happened yet. (While Highway 120 has been closed, Bay Area visitors have been reaching the park via Highway 140, a detour of roughly 30 miles.)</p><p>Though the reopening of Big Oak Flat Road doesnt change northbound driving directions for most visitors from Southern California  who enter the park by way of Oakhurst and Highway 41  it is likely to ease traffic circulation in the park. And it means visitors can follow loop itineraries, entering from the south entrance and returning by way of the west entrance.</p><p>Today, </p>June 9,<p> the park is </p>also <p>starting summer shuttle service on Mariposa Grove Road. That service takes visitors from Mariposa Grove Welcome Plaza  near the park's south entrance  to Mariposa Grove, home to more than 500 giant sequoia trees. (The road from the plaza to the trees is open only to shuttle buses and private vehicles with disability placards.)</p><p>Meanwhile, road crews are working toward summer openings for Glacier Point Road and Tioga Road, but because of lingering snow and construction</p>s<p>, dates remain uncertain.</p><p>Glacier Point Road is expected to open "no earlier than July, probably later," Yosemite's website reports. This is the seasonal route that gives visitors access to </p> the <p>classic view of Half Dome from Glacier Point, about 7,200 feet above sea level and 3,200 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley. Glacier Point Road was closed all last summer for construction. Even after reopening, rangers say, 30-minute delays are likely at first.</p><p>The opening date also remains unknown for the parks most popular seasonal route, Tioga Road, which connects Yosemite to the Owens Valley near Lee Vining and Mono Lake. Tioga Road, snowbound in winter, often opens in May or June after mild winters, June or July after snowy ones. But this years heavy Sierra snowpack  244% of normal on April 1  has rangers reluctant to make any prediction for this summer.</p><p>Another factor for summer travelers to weigh</p>t<p>: Yosemite Valley may be unusually crowded this summer, especially on weekends. This is the first time in four years that the park hasnt required advance booking for summertime day-tripper visits to the valley. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But off-screen, Lewison is a recent graduate of USC who loves to bake, play video games, hit the gym, eat like a king and wander around nostalgic places. </p><p>"Sometimes you become slightly desensitized to how magical [L.A.] can feel, said Lewison, who still lives in South Central near the USC campus after finishing school a year early. </p><p>With "Never Have I Ever" returning for its fourth and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-03-08/never-have-i-ever-netflix-season-4-mindy-kaling">final</a> season this week,</p>JUNE 8<p> Lewison takes us through some of the spots he's enjoyed with his friends and the show's cast and crew. Heres how hed spend a perfect Sunday in L.A.</p><p><b>9:30 a.m.: Pop out of bed</b></p><p>My alarm is at 9:30 a.m. every day. My family says we have the Lewison curse, which means you just never sleep. I'm also the type of person where my alarm goes off and I'm out of bed 30 seconds later, brushing my teeth.</p><p><b>9:45 a.m.: Head to the gym</b></p><p>I grab a protein bar and walk to the <b>USC Lyon Recreation Center</b>, which is where I work out. Im about to move, but for the last four years  my entire time being out in L.A.  I've lived and gone to school at USC. I graduated a year ago, but I'm still sort of living the college life. All my friends are still here and a lot of them are from out of state, so I was like, you know what? Ill spend one more year with my friends. </p><p><b>12 p.m.: Snack time</b></p><p>Then I'll come home, shower and I'll make the best protein shake of all time. I use this protein powder that's chocolate-flavored, the brand is Dymatize. I get two scoops of peanut butter in there and then some oat milk. I'm telling you, it tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Then, in a perfect world, I'm gonna make some Oreo cookie brownie bars to enjoy after dinner. I'm a big baker. I have a massive sweet tooth.</p><p><b>1 p.m.: Get lunch at the </b><a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/" target="_blank"><b>Original Farmers Market</b></a></p><p>I'm going to the <b>Ffarmers mMarket </b>at <b>Tthe</b> <b>Grove</b>. When I was a kid, I would come to L.A. for pilot season and I would eat at the farmers market with my mom and then drive to an audition.</p><p>Lunch is gonna be with my roommates, who are my best friends. I might have a corned beef sandwich at one of the deli spots. I might do the kebab stand. I might do the fried chicken place. I like to eat, so it could be that I go get a pickle from the <a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/merchants/kaylin-and-kaylin-pickles" target="_blank">little pickle guy stand</a>, or at least a sample. I'd probably get a fresh squeezed lemonade. I would like to say I can control myself, but I probably can't.</p><p><b>2 p.m.: Pick out a new book</b></p><p>Then I'm probably walking around <b>Barnes &amp; Noble</b>. I was never a reader growing up but after college, I was like, I want to read. I really like realistic fiction or sci-fi. Growing up, "Ender's Game" was like the only thing I ever read besides Percy Jackson and like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent"  whatever was popular. But recently, I read all of Sally Rooney's books. And I really liked those  I'm a huge fan of Normal People. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal, their performances [in "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six"] are mind-boggling to me and that's one of my favorite limited series. So right now, I'm reading "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six." I guess if it gets adapted into a TV show, I'm like, oh, I should do it.</p><p><b>2:30 p.m.: Wander around a museum&nbsp;</b></p><p>It might be the<b> Broad</b>. It might be the<b> Academy Museum of Motion Pictures</b>. I've been wanting to go to the <b>Petersen Automotive Museum</b>, so I'm probably gonna go there with my friends. I have a dream of owning a raven black Thunderbird, like a 1957 with chrome, red interior, and it's a convertible.</p><p>It's a very silly vision, but in my mind, when I've made it, I've got that car, I'm in a black suit with a black dress shirt with Ray-Ban sunglasses. The top is down and I'm driving down PCH to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqR1cjuPXUg&amp;ab_channel=ColterWall-Topic">The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie</a>. So I think that the Petersen Automotive Museum might be the closest I ever get to sitting in that car and driving on PCH while that song plays, but we'll see, you never know.</p><p><b>4:30 p.m.: Get an afternoon cone</b></p><p>My family has a tradition: we used to do 3 o'clock ice cream on vacations. I'm going to <b>McConnell's Fine Ice Creams</b> and as dark chocolate as it can get, that's what I want. My family is in Dallas, but I'll send them a picture in our family group chat.</p><p><b>5 p.m.: Head home to play Rocket League</b></p><p>My little group of seven will probably have a couple of drinks and we like to play <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>. That's a big one in my house, we do some tournaments. My Rocket League partner, Dan, is one of my best friends. We've definitely figured out how to get some chemistry going on the Rocket League field.</p><p><b>7:15 p.m.: Eat as much meat as humanly possible </b></p><p>We're going to K-Town. I love Korean barbecue, I'm probably eating my face off. We're gonna have some beer, we're gonna have all the meat, maybe some of the fixings, but definitely a lot of meat. I'll probably be the grill master.</p><p>The first [Korean barbecue joint] that I was ever exposed to was <b>Gyu-Kaku</b>, which is really solid. But there are a couple of gems in K-town. Every time I go, I try a new place. <b>Quarters Korean BBQ</b> is really, really good. I actually went there with the "Never Have I Ever" crew and cast.</p><p><b>9:30 p.m.: Choose an adventure </b></p><p>There are a few options now. We could do karaoke in K-town. Im a Texas boy. I am not a singer, but I think I can sing a country song and be all right. I think it's gonna be "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker. One time, my roommate and I went up for karaoke and sang "My Way" by Frank Sinatra, and I do think that brought the house down.</p><p>Or perhaps an escape room. Or we're going back to my house, and it's a game night. My house is a Settlers of Catan house. We actually have a chalkboard wall and we have a winner's standings column that gets updated after every game.</p><p><b>12 a.m.: Grab a midnight snack at Canters</b></p><p>At this point, it might be time to go to <b>Canter's Deli</b>. I'm a huge Jewish deli person and Canter's is open 24 hours, so I'm gonna milk the hell out of that. </p>So I'm probably getting the corned beef sandwich. And then I think bedtime is around 1:30 a.m.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It's also a ride that's likely weirder than you remember it. Its a world of tears, hopes and fears, the irresistible song tells us, reminding us were alike in both our hopes and what stresses us.</p><p>It's a Disneyland original, and there's no other ride quite like it at the theme parks. </p>There's no debate, right?just cuz... there was a debate<p>Times readers, however, had a slightly different pick for the best ride at the Disneyland Resort. </p><p>It turns out that it's a pirate</p> '<p>s life for many of you. Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean  our No. 2 ride at the resort  received the majority of votes for the top ride at the park, with readers singling out its sense of adventure  instantly recognizable from the ride's musty scent  humor and light thrills as what makes it deserving of the top spot. But I don't feel too bad. Not only do I love Pirates of the Caribbean, but It's a Small World came in at No. 2 in our reader poll, indicating that Disneyland die-hards love the classics best.</p><p>"I too love Its a Small World, but it is another boat ride that has always been my favorite," wrote Kammie Rivera. "As a child, standing in line for that ride I felt both scared and excited. I knew there was the drop at the beginning of the ride and it frightened and thrilled me. I also knew once we past the drop, then the smaller drop the music would come roaring on and you went through a romanticized vision of what pirate life was like."</p><p>"Its fully immersive," wrote Rebecca Mabee. "The scent snaps me right back to childhood as does the feel of the air. The darkness forces your senses to stay engaged, and there are small thrills along the way  it has it all!"</p><p>The poll, however, wasn't overwhelmingly unanimous. </p> Turns out,<p> picking a favorite ride at Disneyland isn't </p>always <p>easy. Does one vote for personal nostalgia, historical importance or modern wizardry? Readers singled out 18 different attractions, including two that are no longer at the resort  the Carousel of Progress and </p> t<p>he Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, rides that live on in Florida at Walt Disney World. </p><p>In agreeing with me regarding It's a Small World, reader Jan Lloyd wrote, "Not only is it a joyous ride, it is the ride that helps break down the barriers in this world, reminding us we are all here on the planet earth as one family."</p><p>Pirates of the Caribbean led with about 26% of the votes. </p>Not too far behind was  As a runner   - up<p>, It's a Small World, </p>which<p> received about 16% of No.1 votes. A few rides were tied with 7% of the votes, including the Haunted Mansion, the Disneyland Railroad and Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance. </p>The latter, along with That last one and <p>Indiana Jones Adventure</p>,<p> were the only modern rides to receive multiple votes, as Times readers</p>  who took the survey<p> tend to favor the attractions </p> with  that represent a <p>historical importance. </p>of the park. <p>Still, we loved Rise of the Resistance in our rankings, placing it at No. 4. We argued that if It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted Mansion represent Disneyland's past, Rise of the Resistance represents its future. </p><p>Reader Iris Polak agreed. "The first time I rode [Rise of the Resistance] was a constant barrage of, 'Wait, they can do that?' I rode a motion simulator as part of the pre-show, got arrested by the First Order, watched the walls be struck by blaster fire and had my trackless ride vehicle drop into a motion simulator for the finale. The wait may be twice what Id wait for even my second favorite, but theres at least three different rides in there, so its a deal."</p><p>If there was one thing many of the votes had in common, it's that readers highlighted rides that </p> emphasize emphasisis<p> world-building over high-speed thrills. In making the case for the Haunted Mansion, Shawndra Kuffel wrote, "The theme of this deathly attraction in the happiest place on earth shouldnt work and yet the macabre humor and spooky vibes of this haunted house thrills in every way."</p><p>While Big Thunder Mountain, the Matterhorn and the Incredicoaster received some attention, the resort's pure thrill rides seemed to split the vote. It was old-fashioned Disney storytelling that our readers gravitated toward.</p><p>"There are certainly superior technical and sophisticated rides and attractions at Disneyland and California Adventure, but the sheer non-technical nature of the Storybook Land Canal Boats is precisely why I love it," Gail Robillard wrote. "From the moment you enter Monstro's mouth, reality is suspended and you enter a fantasy world of fairy tales. No tech, no drops, just lazy water and detailed miniatures."</p>You can read our ride rankings <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/list/disneyland-rides-ranked">here</a></p>.                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Here, youll find 15 ways to make the most of summer 2019.</p>May 25-26:<p> Gidget had one. So did Frankie and Annette. Is there anything more quintessentially California than <b>a bonfire on the beach</b>?</p><p>Its definitely a cool thing to do, said Jon Kincaid as he sat by his primed bonfire at Dockweiler Beach recently, with three grocery-store cords of wood standing at the ready. His date, Ashley Gomez, looked more cold than chill in the late-afternoon breeze.</p><p>The two just started dating a week ago, Gomez said, and shed never had a bonfire at the beach, so Kincaid drove them from their homes in Glendale for an evening of cooking food on a stick over an open fire, with the cry of seagulls and ocean smells mingling with the thick aroma of lighter fluid. Its been fun, she said somewhat grudgingly. Its a more relaxing date than normal.</p><p>Nowadays its not so easy to arrange a bonfire date. Complaints from residents and environmental concerns have closed most of the opportunities in Los Angeles County. Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro has a few pits, but the biggest crowds come to Dockweiler, at the western end of Imperial Highway in Playa del Rey. People come from all over the county to stake out one of the 60-odd, no-reservation pits before theyre gone, said Nicole Mooradian, public information officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches and Harbors.</p><p>The pits are first come, first served, she said. Ive heard of people hiring people through the TaskRabbit app to just go sit there in the morning to reserve their spot.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/be/50/ef9bb4c7a296a56d00699245c3b4/la-1558466427-da9l23i7b5-snap-image"></figure><p>Your best chance for a fire pit is to arrive before noon. Bring plenty of wood  Kincaid said his grocery store bundles last about 45 minutes  and a way to ignite your fire, such as lighter fluid, kindling or even paper plates. Youd be amazed at the people Ive seen here, trying to light their wood with a match, he said. Im like, Dude, thats not going to work.</p><p>Dont despair if you cant arrive early. Bring wood anyway, Kincaid said, and then ask someone if theyre willing to share their bonfire. People underestimate how quickly their wood will burn, and they find themselves with a dwindling fire early in the evening, he said. Theyre going to have to leave anyway, so if you have wood, you have something valuable to offer.</p>Dockweiler State Beach, 12000 Vista del Mar, Playa del Rey, CA 90293, includes 118 RV hookups; fire pits outside the RV park are open to the public. <a href="https://beaches.lacounty.gov/dockweiler-beach/" target="_blank">beaches.lacounty.gov/dockweiler-beach/</a> In Orange County, check out fire pits at Huntington Beach and San Clemente.<p> Jeanette Marantos</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9b/b7/e569425001ad1e362bb32622b0f1/la-1558470334-oy28zeaqrf-snap-image"></figure>June 1-2<p><b>: </b>Most visitors to <b>the island of Santa Catalina</b>, about 30 miles off the coast from Long Beach, stick to the quaint bayside town of Avalon.

(There is a <a href="https://www.catalinachamber.com/island-info/catalina-island/getting-around/">25-year waiting list</a> to own a car on the island.)</p><p>But Catalinas rugged backcountry is stunningly beautiful, with pristine coves, pine forests, rare wildflowers, bald eagles, a unique species of fox and even herds of wild bison, the descendants of a dozen or so left behind by a Hollywood crew in the 1920s.</p><p>Thanks to hundreds of miles of trails and unpaved roads, the interior is accessible by foot or bicycle.

All they see are the concrete culverts. The water often looks more like the runoff of a Jiffy Lube than that of a great American river. And in no way does it qualify as a great river. Yet the L.A. River is undergoing a renaissance, making these <b>kayak trips in the shadow of Dodger Stadium</b> a sought-after summer experience.</p><p>There are two kayak stretches. One is a slow, dark-eyed bayou in the San Fernando Valley near the Sepulveda Basin. Beautiful, but lazy  a Disney theme ride for kids.</p><p>Better yet  more splashy, and with some zigs and zags  is this Glendale Narrows stretch. Sporty but not treacherous, the rapids meander between islands. Its not for everyone, says L.A. River Expeditions founder George Wolfe, but people whove got some kayaking experience, are reasonably active and have a good attitude will be rewarded with a  bucket-list experience.</p>L.A.

If youre splurging, you start at 4 p.m., which gives you a saddleback view of the city from near the top of Mount Hollywood during golden hour, just before sunset .</p><p>The ranch, whose stables house about 50 horses, goes back to 1929  when the sign above still said HOLLYWOODLAND and had flashing lights. For many years, the ranchs offerings also included a two-hour ride into the San Fernando Valley, dinner and margaritas in a Mexican restaurant, followed by a ride back. But after years of struggling to coax customers back onto their horses after the dinner, the ranch folk came up with the current barbecues instead.

I had never gone on a trip with a pet. </p> When<p> it came time for my boyfriend and me to plan </p> our<p> annual road trip  <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1183424667614248960" target="_blank">two years ago</a> we went to Yosemite and <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1315722873701425152" target="_blank">last year</a> we did Arizona, New Mexico and Utah  with a pandemic puppy now living with us, we quickly realized we wanted <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1369329630386155520" target="_blank">Millie, our 11-month-old goldendoodle</a>, to come along.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to our trip that took us to five national parks  Capitol Reef, Arches, Rocky Mountain, Black Canyon of the Gunnison and Grand Canyon  <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1446493385141805064" target="_blank">in a rented camper van</a>, I did tons of research about where to stay, what to do and what to see, including finding dog parks and other dog-friendly spaces.</p><p>Two days before we set out on our </p> six-day, five-night<p> trek, I voiced concerns to John. Were we doing the right thing by taking Millie with us? Would she like being in the van for the majority of most days? Would she behave? Would there be enough for her to see and do? </p><p>Ultimately, we decided it was too late to change our plans. We just had to go with it. We ended up having a great time and making the sweetest memories. If you're planning to hit the road in 2022, especially for the first time with a pet, these are some things we learned along the way about traveling with a dog.</p><p><b>Do your research to find the camper van company that works for you. </b>We used <a href="https://www.cabana.life/" target="_blank">Cabana</a>, which I had first heard about <a href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2021-06-11/shower-check-flat-screen-tv-check-roughing-it-is-fun-in-a-tricked-out-camper-van">in a Times article</a> earlier this year. It allows pets (for a fee). And the big sell? It had unlimited mileage. That was important to us because we knew we'd drive far (we clocked close to 2,500 miles), and we found most other companies only allow for a set number of miles per day and then charge per mile after that.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/75/94/54aceb7e46a79702f1d399031bfa/la-photos-1staff-la-tr-van-life-with-dog-martinez-06.JPG"></figure><p><b>Find dog parks or other places your dog can stretch its legs along your route. </b>Depending on your dog's energy level and needs, you'll want to stop the car every two hours or so. I made note of a dog park or two every day of the trip so we never had to worry. Still, despite my extensive research, we were pleasantly surprised by a small fenced-in area at a rest stop in southwest Utah where we let Millie run. We stopped at several rest stops along the way when we were ready for a break, but we really loved a Moab, Utah, dog park where Millie <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CU2Ylo1hIO-/" target="_blank">got her legs covered in red dirt</a> and a large park in Montrose, Colo., with lots of trees and small trails where Millie could explore.</p><p><b>Look into dog-friendly spots near your destination      or destinations  . </b>Our plan was to make this a national park tour, but national parks aren't overly dog friendly. (They're allowed but access varies. We found Black Canyon National Park <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CU5Hm5Jr7Ye/" target="_blank">was very welcoming</a>.) This meant tracking down dog parks or state parks, which typically allow dogs, nearby. (</p> I found that <p>Rocky Mountain <a href="https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/pets.htm" target="_blank">does a great job</a> of advertising close dog-friendly places</p>  on its website   ,  nps.gov website address needed for print; remove for online<p>.)</p><p><b>Before you go, practice driving your dog around especially if it's not used to a moving vehicle. </b>Millie is in a car most days, although I was still worried she'd get carsick on the trip. </p> Thankfully she<p> never did </p> despite<p> winding, mountainous roads. We think being used to being in a car helped her a lot.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ea/be/ad33a16342d1b74d7e1477b5ba19/la-photos-1staff-la-tr-van-life-with-dog-martinez-08.JPG"></figure><p><b>Buy a few things for your dog that'll make life on the road easier. </b>One of the first things we bought as we neared the start of the trip was a cheap dog bed. We knew it'd likely get dirty (it did) and we were fine with throwing it out when we got home. We also bought a pad for Millie to </p> lielay<p> on outside </p>of <p>the van once we were at a campground, a 20-foot leash so she could have some freedom to explore, and a thick bone marrow chew for long stretches in the van.</p><p><b>Bring the comforts of home with you, too. </b>I packed up so much of Millie's stuff it may have looked like we were moving. We brought the dog bed, blankets, a stuffed animal and a few chew sticks and balls. Because I was so worried how she'd do, I may have overdone it, but she seemed to like to have options. Millie especially loved a rope toy, which kept her busy in the van and we'd play together at campgrounds before settling in.</p><p><b>Overpack if you're able. </b>If you have some extra room in your vehicle, overpacking can make all the difference. We knew we would camp in semi-remote areas and we had days with long drives, so we made sure to bring a few extra things. This is what helped us: towels for when we were covered in dirt, more than enough allergy pills, an extra blanket for the bed and tons of snacks. We also packed more jugs of water than we needed. For Millie, we also had towels, lots of treats and an abundance of food. We always had a small amount of water and food available to her in the van as we drove, and whenever we stopped somewhere, we took a collapsible water bowl for her.</p><p><b>Look into apps to download ahead of time because you may lose service. </b>In Moab</p> , <p>John and I ran into Morgan Phillips and Amber Calvo, who do photography work for Cabana, and they told us about <a href="https://www.ioverlander.com/" target="_blank">iOverlander</a>, an app they use to find places to park their van away from people so <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUDKiyHJG35/" target="_blank">their two dogs</a> can run (we do not trust Millie enough yet for that). We downloaded the app and toward the end of our trip, when we were in a crunch, we used it for the first time. iOverlander had plenty of recommendations  submitted by the app's users  of remote places to park and overnight street parking in cities. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/73/84/6f4ca47d44058bd5a5e356c626cd/la-photos-1staff-la-tr-van-life-with-dog-martinez-07.JPG"></figure><p><b>Make a backup plan for everything, especially if you're going somewhere with bad weather. </b>I had lengthy notes ahead of the trip, but there were a few instances</p>  for which<p> I didn't have backup plan. We found ourselves having a small setback our first night in Colorado when snow caused a highway to shut down, preventing us from getting to our campsite. We ended up scrambling to find a spot to spend the night. After initially failing to find a place to park the van overnight, we tried a nearby campground, a hotel and street parking. We ended up settling for the night in a large parking lot in Golden, Colo., that served a strip mall, a Holiday Inn Express and a Home Depot. </p><p><b>Last, have realistic expectations. </b>This could be in terms of your vehicle, your plans, your traveling partner or your pet. Millie has never walked more than </p> two2<p> miles at a time, so we knew tough hikes wouldn't be an option. Because we had an ambitious itinerary, we also knew we never had too long in any one place. Still, we carved out time for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dark.sky.coffee/?hl=en" target="_blank">local coffee in Torrey</a>, dinner from a food truck <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1446876576558157827" target="_blank">under string lights in Moab</a>, stopping to marvel at <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1447651833170694145" target="_blank">yellow trees in Telluride</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamartinez/status/1447935729376636928" target="_blank">playing in the snow at the Grand Canyon</a>.</p><p>So, will we travel with Millie again? Two days into this trip, we already started planning the next one.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
