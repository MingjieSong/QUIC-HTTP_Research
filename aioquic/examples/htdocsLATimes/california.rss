Pride parade, said Councilman John Heilman, who was on the inaugural council.</p><p>They weren't intimidated  too much was at stake.</p><p>"Us being out and being visible  that in and of itself is a political statement," said Heilman, 65, who is gay and has been attending Pride events for four decades. </p><p>Since then, there have been tragedies and trials  and immense progress as LGBTQ+ people found broader acceptance in American society, won the right to same-sex marriage, could serve openly in the U.S. military. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3e/d2/36f5ae9747a58d1a5b7daa635125/1301234-me-0604-weho-pride-parade-gem-012.jpg"></figure><p>It seemed that, especially in liberal California, the LGBTQ+ movement had finally <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-lgbt-activism-20150712-story.html">gone mainstream.</a> To some, the colorful annual parades even became  of all things  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-10102020-gay-pride-boycott-notourpride-snap-story.html">kind of bland.</a> </p><p>But this year, Pride month comes amid a volatile national backlash against LGBTQ+ people, from conservative lawmakers' efforts to ban drag shows and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-07/wave-of-anti-trans-laws-reminds-advocates-of-another-struggle-abortion-rights">restrict the rights of transgender people</a> to outcry against brands </p>like<p>such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-25/anti-transgender-backlash-against-bud-light-explained">Bud Light</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-24/target-removes-lgbtq-merchandise-pride-month-threats-workers">Target</a> for marketing to queer people. </p><p>In Southern California recently, protests erupted in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-02/parents-protest-lgbtq-pride-day-los-angeles-saticoy-elementary-school">North Hollywood</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">Glendale</a> over the teaching of gender and sexuality in schools. The L.A. Dodgers invited, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-19/sisters-of-perpetual-indulgence-dodgers-pride-night">then booted,</a> then <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2023-05-22/dodgers-apologize-invite-sisters-perpetual-indulgence-pride-night">re-invited</a> the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2023-05-25/the-sisters-of-perpetual-indulgence-are-on-a-mission-to-spread-universal-joy-despite-the-dodgers-drama">satirical nuns in drag,</a> to its Pride Night. </p><p>For queer people in and around West Hollywood, the internationally </p>-<p>known </p>mecca<p>haven for LGBTQ+ culture and longtime home of L.A. Pride, the vitriol has been met with sadness and anger, but little surprise. </p><p>Amid the backlash, they say, Pride feels more relevant than ever. </p><p>"It may be a little bit pass for some of us who've been around a long time, but I have to say, every Pride I feel a sense of renewal ... I see all these young people out celebrating in a way I don't think I did at their age, and that gives me a lot of hope," Heilman said. </p><p>Bamby Salcedo, president and chief executive of the TransLatin@</p> cq @ sign<p> Coalition, said that with right-wing politicians seemingly using transgender people "as political pawns" to "gain votes and to cater to extremist people," it feels especially important this year to be marching. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/7f/fe/7d4eace44f3185b105922be2867c/1301234-me-0604-weho-pride-parade-gem-020.jpg"></figure><p>"If we focus on the negativity, that will bring us down," said Salcedo, 53. "When we have these moments like Pride, we are ... able to show our joy to the world and our community so that they are able to understand that, regardless of the challenges we continue to experience, we find joy in whatever way possible." </p><p>As Pride grew into a social  and financial  behemoth, fissures emerged.</p><p>This month, L.A. Pride and the newer WeHo Pride are taking place on back-to-back weekends, two miles apart  the result of years of tension between L.A. Pride's parent organization, Christopher Street West, and the city of West Hollywood.</p><p>Critics said L.A. Pride, which at 53 is one of the nation's oldest Pride parades, had become too corporate, the festival tickets too expensive. And there were widespread complaints that the organization and city were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-15/lgbtq-pride-black-lives-controversy">unwelcoming of queer people of color</a> and transgender people. </p><p>So West Hollywood, which hosted L.A. Pride for four decades, launched its own parade and festival last year. </p><p>This year's WeHo Pride wound along Santa Monica Boulevard last weekend. L.A. Pride will step off <a href="https://lapride.org/2023-la-pride-village-parade-route-revealed/" target="_blank">Sunday</a> morning at Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue, about four blocks northeast of West Hollywood city limits. </p><p>Salcedo marched in WeHo Pride while dressed as a social justice warrior carrying a shield that read, "Invest in Trans Lives." And she will be at the L.A. Pride parade this weekend. </p><p>For the TransLatin@ Coalition, she said, Pride isn't just a party. It's a critical venue for passing out information about resources for queer people, about combating hate and about the prevention of COVID-19 and other diseases.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/eb/80/2a5509c0417cb9e74e3931333766/1301234-me-0604-weho-pride-parade-gem-014.jpg"></figure><p>Gerald Garth, the board president for Christopher Street West, has been coming to L.A. Pride for a decade. </p><p>In 2013, Garth had just moved to Los Angeles from Louisiana. He hopped on a bus to West Hollywood alone, </p>in <p>wearing a feather boa and a fedora with a rainbow-colored brim.</p><p>"In the body which I occupy, there has to be a great level of boldness to occupy it, as a tall, dark Black man," said Garth, 40. "There's a very prescribed experience which society has given him, and then you layer that with an LGBTQ+ experience."</p><p>By the time he finished walking down Santa Monica Boulevard, Garth felt lighter. More joyful. It felt, he said, like he was "initiated into the rainbow." </p><p>No matter what's going on politically, first-timers </p> are <p>transformed by </p> the <p>Pride parade each year, Garth said. </p><p>With thousands of people on the streets, security is a top priority, organizers for both L.A. Pride and WeHo Pride said. </p><p>Increasingly, there is debate about the presence of armed law enforcement officers at Pride. </p><p>The LGBTQ+ community has a fraught history with police, who, for decades, raided gay bars </p>like<p>such as the famed <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-stonewall-inn-anniversary-20190628-story.html">Stonewall Inn</a> in New York and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-silver-lake-black-cat-lgbtq-20170208-story.html">Black Cat tavern</a> in Silver Lake. </p><p>At WeHo Pride last weekend, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested two volunteers at a booth for Equal Means Equal, a nonprofit that pushes for the adoption of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/us/equal-rights-amendment-what-is-it.html" target="_blank">Equal Rights Amendment</a> to the U.S. Constitution. </p><p>A video <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1665405269814247425?s=20" target="_blank">posted to Twitter</a> shows at least six uniformed deputies wrestling LGBTQ+ activist Xodiac Rose and their friend Abby Thomas to the pavement. </p><p>"At Pride, oh my </p> G<p>od!" a bystander shouted.</p><p>"This is what we mean!" Rose, 25, screamed as they were being handcuffed. A deputy, Rose yelled, "was being homophobic" and laughing at signs at the booth. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9e/f3/f88d28494732a74cf4464ac8a12d/1301234-me-0604-weho-pride-parade-gem-008.jpg"></figure><p>In <a href="https://nixle.com/EGY2Z" target="_blank">a statement,</a> the </p> S<p>heriff's </p> D<p>epartment said Rose, who was in custody for four days, had an outstanding warrant </p> on claims offor<p> battery, vandalism and </p>robbery  robbing someone<p> of a cellphone outside the West Hollywood </p> L<p>ibrary in April. </p><p>Thomas, 28, was arrested on suspicion of "interfering and obstructing an arrest," according to the </p> S<p>heriff's </p> D<p>epartment. She was released from custody hours later, and witnesses dispute the allegation.</p><p>Alice Crenshaw, a spokesperson for Equal Means Equal who witnessed the arrests and called them "extremely aggressive," said the warrant against Rose stemmed from a protest outside a Drag Queen Story Hour event at the West Hollywood Library. </p><p>Videos <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/status/1665405647679107072?s=20" target="_blank">posted on Twitter</a> show <a href="https://twitter.com/SamBraslow/status/1647297282042400769?s=20" target="_blank">Rose voguing</a> in front of a man filming outside the library. Rose then stomped on a cellphone. A far-right website called Right Now Views  which includes </p>numerous <p>videos of protests outside LGBTQ+ events  created a wanted poster with photos of Rose, the words "Tweaker Antifa" and a phone number for the </p> S<p>heriff's </p> D<p>epartment. </p><p>In an email, West Hollywood Mayor Sepi Shyne said it was "deeply disconcerting to see images of anyone being held on the pavement surrounded by deputies in gear" and "even more alarming when this takes place in our safe LGBTQ+ spaces."</p><p>"Pride celebrations are supposed to be places where we as queer people feel empowered, affirmed, and safe," she wrote. "We cant lose sight of the fact that this is emblematic of a larger division in our nation right now."</p><p>Shyne said she has heard from community members who want no law enforcement at Pride celebrations and from others who are grateful for added security during tense times. The city, she said, is working to "balance safety concerns, which is our responsibility during Pride, with the legitimate concerns of our LGBTQ community members who have had difficult relationships with law enforcement in the past." </p><p>Shyne, 46, who is Iranian American and the first queer woman of color elected to the</p> West Hollywood<p> City Council, said Pride is essential. </p><p>"In Iran, LGBTQ people are given the death sentence, so there are no Pride celebrations," she wrote. </p><p>"Pride events, with all their public displays of flair, flamboyance, and fun are vital  because someone somewhere, even in a City like West Hollywood, still may believe they would be better off dead than be LGBTQ. We can't let that happen." </p><p>On Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood this week, people were reveling in Pride </p> m<p>onth, with all its rainbow flags and ribald humor. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0b/ca/d477299e4b9290e00ba585bd029b/1301234-me-0604-weho-pride-parade-gem-017.jpg"></figure><p>A banner on the window of Hugo's Restaurant read: #dragisnotacrime. A sign in the window of the West Hollywood Library promoting Drag Queen Story Hour advertised "Fake Eyelashes, Real News." Giant ads with muscular men wearing skimpy swim trunks and stethoscopes promoted an HIV-prevention drug with the words: "I Ho, You Ho, WeHo ... together on PrEP." </p><p>At The Gallery at Circus of Books, Jess Clauss, 42, a studio manager for fashion designer Julia Clancey, adjusted displays for her Pride collection, arranging "budgie smugglers"  briefs-style swim bottoms  with colorful banana prints and <a href="https://www.juliaclancey.com/collections/pride/products/luxe-madam-electric-frou-kaftan" target="_blank">shimmery kaftans</a>. </p><p>Clauss, of Koreatown, went to WeHo Pride at his husband's urging. He initially resisted because, as a younger gay man, he felt a lot of pressure to "have a certain physique." </p><p>But his husband told him: "Let's make our own memories." He came away inspired, especially by younger queer people who "are not as concerned about appearance." </p><p>The same weekend, his niece came out as pansexual by posting on Instagram that she was "living my truth." She had faced some resistance from loved ones. He shared his own experiences as a queer person and told her he supported her. </p><p>The national backlash against LBGTQ+ people is frustrating, Clauss said. But ultimately, things are so much better than when he was discovering his sexuality, without access to the internet or much information at all. </p><p>"It seems like the rhetoric," he said, "is a result of all the progress we've made."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

wife clean out her father's 1900s-era home about nine months ago when they stumbled upon something truly unexpected. </p><p>Reyes was rummaging through the crawl space in the basement of his late father-in-law's home when he found some loose pennies held together by disintegrating paper rolls. He kept looking and eventually found dozens of bank bags containing copper pennies. </p><p>Reyes, 41, a real estate agent in the Inland Empire, estimated the bags contained about 1 million pennies  with a face value of $10,000. </p><p>"There are banks [named] on the bags I havent even heard of or dont exist anymore," he added. </p><p>Reyes and his family initially intended to take the pennies to a bank and exchange them for their dollar value. He called a Wells Fargo bank in Los Angeles, but the manager told him that they didn't even have enough room for all the coins. The manager told Reyes to bring about $300 worth of pennies at a time but Reyes said that would be impossible because the pennies were all wrapped in paper rolls. </p><p>Reyes then called his local bank and spoke with the manager, who was in disbelief. </p><p>"I showed her a photo and she was like, 'Ive been working with Wells Fargo for forever and I've never seen anything like this. You cant cash these in. Theres a chance you may have valuable pennies,'" he said. </p><p>The U.S. Mint initially made pennies <a href="https://www.usmint.gov/learn/history/historic-coin-production#:~:text=For%20the%20year%201943%2C%20pennies,zinc%20with%20only%202.5%25%20copper." target="_blank">of pure copper</a>, but starting in 1943 pennies were manufactured out of zinc-covered steel because copper was needed during </p>the war effort in <p>World War II. Starting in 1982, the penny was made primarily out of zinc. </p><p>Reyes started researching penny hunters on TikTok and considered determining the exact value of the vintage coins but the family decided they would prefer if someone could take them all off their hands. </p><p>He put the coins on OfferUp, a resale website, asking for three times the coins' </p>dollar <p>value, amounting to about $25,000 to $30,000. He said he's received a few offers from people who said they could take a third or half of the pennies. </p><p>The coins were hauled off by heavy-duty trucks and </p> stored in<p> an undisclosed location in the Inland Empire. </p><p>Reyes said his father-in-law, Fritz, and Fritz's brother emigrated from Germany to the U.S. in the 1960s and were known as "war babies" because they were born during wartime. </p>also known as "war babies." <p>The house, which was built in 1904, has seven bedrooms, three kitchens and multiple bathrooms.

He did not survive.</p><p>The Marine Mammal Center, a nonprofit animal research hospital that oversees 600 miles of the California coast, recently released a report listing hot spots where numerous marine mammals were harassed by people last year. </p><p>More than 25</p> %percent <p>of its animal patients were admitted due to negative interactions with people and dogs  highlighting the impacts of human interference in wildlife, according to researchers.</p><p>Put simply: We're getting too close, said Giancarlo Rulli, a spokesperson for the Marine Mammal Center. In some circumstances, we are literally loving these marine mammals to death.</p><p>The Sausalito-based center covers the coast from Mendocino to San Luis Obispo counties. California sea lions, Northern Elephant Seals, and Pacific harbor seals are the centers most common patients.</p><p>Seals and sea lions are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibits the harassment, hunting, capturing and killing of these animals.</p><p>Taking that once-in-a-lifetime shot or selfie may seem cute or innocent, but it creates challenges for marine mammals, especially young seals and sea lions, Rulli said.</p><p>The areas with the highest recorded cases of human wildlife interference were Santa Cruz and Monterey counties, which accounted for about 40% of the centers admitted patients last year, Rulli said. But thats not too surprising, he added.</p><p><b></b>Monterey Bay is like a sea cafeteria, Rulli said. Theres ecological bounty in the area for numerous marine mammal species, but its also a very busy tourist area along our coast.</p><p>Other hotspots along the coast included San Luis Obispo with 18% of harassment incidents, San Mateo with 13%, and San Francisco with 8% of the recorded cases last year.</p><p>Crowding was the most common type of harassment followed by touching and picking up, which made up about 35% of all cases. Incidents were equally common during the spring pupping season and in summer, researchers said.</p><p>Although the overall number of cases were fewer in the Bay Area than in the Central Coast, incidents up north were found to be more more severe, according to the report. In Marin County, researchers noted more cases of illegal pickups of harbor seal pups. Human and dog interactions with young seals and sea lions were recorded in high numbers in</p> the<p> San Francisco and San Mateo counties.</p><p>Rulli said it's the first time the center has collected this kind of data, and researchers plan to use it as a baseline to track marine mammal health and address behavioral issues related to human wildlife interaction.</p><p>We are very lucky that we can go to many places along the California coast and view wildlife up close. But with that comes increased responsibility on our part to share the shore with these animals, Rulli said.</p><p>In Los Angeles County, the Marine Mammal Care Center rescues, </p>rehabilates  rehabilitates <p>and releases injured animals along the coast and on Catalina Island. Though they have not collected data like their colleagues up north, CEO John Warner said they intend to start.</p><p>For us, 25% would probably be an under report of what the numbers really are, Warner said.</p><p>In sunny Los Angeles County, beaches are more populated with people and marine mammals are unable to comfortably rest on the shore, Warner said. He remembered incidents in which animals were dragged by the flippers, covered under blankets, or had sand thrown at them.</p><p>Biologists advise people to keep a safe distance from marine mammals on beaches and in the waters. If an animal reacts to you, then you are too close. Photography is fine, but seal-fies are not.</p><p>People who see a marine mammal in distress are asked to not approach them, but instead call the Marine Mammal Centers hotline at 415-289-SEAL or in Los Angeles County call 800-39-WHALE.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Investigators determined that the Lexus was traveling west in the eastbound lanes of Pacific Coast Highway when it collided with the first vehicle, setting off a chain reaction of collisions, according to police.</p><p>Investigators said that speed, drugs and alcohol are not believed to be a factor in this collision, but they did not provide any additional information.

The law would also bar federal immigration authorities or other entities connected to immigration enforcement from accessing city databases or anyones personal data.</p><p>City Council members Bob Blumenfield and John Lee were absent from Friday's vote.</p><p>L.A.'s proposal, referred to the council as a "sanctuary city" law, would essentially codify existing policies, including a <a href="https://lacity.gov/sites/g/files/wph2121/files/2021-04/garcetti_ed20.pdf" target="_blank">2017 executive directive</a> issued by then-Mayor Eric Garcetti. </p><p>If passed, the law would be similar to one in San Francisco. That law prohibits city employees from using city funds or resources to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, officers in the enforcement of federal immigration laws unless such assistance is required by federal or state law.</p><p>The council on Friday also asked for a report back that details any "current gaps" between LAPD Special Order No. 40, a department policy that prohibits police officers from initiating contact with anyone for the sole purpose of learning their immigration status, and Garcetti's 2017 directive. The council also asked for a report on instances when city departments have assisted ICE.</p><p>Those reports are intended to answer outstanding questions about the city's existing policies. </p><p>The motion voted on Friday by the council says that policies allow ICE officers to access city jails to interrogate people in LAPD custody. The motion also states that LAPD officers are permitted to transfer individuals to ICE custody, even when judicial warrants are not issued.</p><p>On Friday, however, the LAPD disputed such claims. </p><p>LAPD Capt. Anthony Otero, assistant commanding officer of the department's Custody Services Division, said the LAPD doesn't allow ICE to enter LAPD jails to interrogate people. Otero also said that the LAPD doesn't transfer people into ICE custody without a judicial warrant.</p><p>Describing the LAPD's relationship with ICE, Otero said</p> the<p> ICE will "fax us holds on occasion for persons we have in custody, at which point we follow our polices." </p><p>Asked to describe its "policies," the LAPD didn't immediately provide The Times an answer.</p> ICE declined to comment Friday on the sanctuary city proposal. The spokesperson said the agency doesnt comment on pending legislation.<p>The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-07/los-angeles-city-council-sanctuary-city-motion">"sanctuary city" motion</a> was brought forward earlier this year by Councilmembers Nithya Raman, Eunisses Hernandez and Hugo Soto-Martnez. It was seconded by Councilmembers Curren Price and Heather Hutt.</p><p>Some of their colleagues asked for more clarity about the city's policies at a March City Council committee hearing on the motion.</p><p>Councilmember Monica Rodriguez, who represents the northeast San Fernando Valley, said at that meeting she was "confused" by suggestions that local government is cooperating with ICE. </p><p>"But more importantly, the suggestion that the city hasn't already adopted these principles," she said. </p><p>Rodriguez also said at that meeting there had been "unintended consequences" because of the city's policies around immigration.</p><p>She said that when President Biden came into office, the city attempted to participate in the reunification of children who had been separated from their immigrant families, but had to leave that work to Los </p>Angles Angeles<p> County. </p><p>"We were unable to participate because of the policies that we had adopted," Rodriguez said.</p><p>Senate Bill 54, Californias so-called sanctuary state law, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-brown-california-sanctuary-state-bill-20171005-story.html">passed in 2017</a>.

The indiscriminate violence was dubbed the Zoot Suit Riots, named for the baggy suits popular among the young people at the time.</p><p>The city of L.A. can finally take responsibility and apologize for its role effectively sanctioning the violence perpetuated eight decades ago, said Councilmember Kevin de Len, who introduced a council <a href="http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2023/23-0004_misc_5-17-23.pdf" target="_blank">resolution</a> last month condemning the riots. </p><p>The council celebrated the historic apology this Friday with zoot suit-clad dancers and remarks from De Len and community leaders, who praised the apology as a necessary step in highlighting the role city played in the weeklong riots. </p><p>"You had young boys  as young as 12 years of age  who were violently beaten, they were stripped of their clothes," De Len said. "Acts that exposed deep-seated racism that targeted Latinos. And just as disgraceful, back in the day, were the actions of our Police Department, the LAPD, and the City Council." </p><p>As De Len started his remarks, a few people in the back heckled him, calling him a racist. Others urged them to show respect. </p><p>In the first week of June 1943, minority youths were beaten, harassed and their clothing was ripped off in the streets, according to reports from the time. Some were urinated on in public, De Len said. </p><p>I remember my mother distinctly telling me when I was a kid how angry and upset she was watching young Mexican kids running down the street naked from having their suit ripped off, said Miguel Lopez with the Chicano Moratorium Committee, who was flanked in the front of council chamber by a few dozen people dressed in Pachuco style.</p><p>As the speakers stood at the front of council chambers, black and white historical images, old newspaper clippings and recent footage of lowriders cruising over the 6th Street Viaduct flashed on two TV screens above the council horseshoe. The newspaper clipping highlighted the support outlets at the time, namely The Times, gave to the cause of the white mobs rather than the victims. Zoot suiters learn lesson in fights with servicemen, read one such headline. </p><p>Manny Alcaraz, described as a Pachuco culture enthusiast, said he hoped the city's apology would inform young generations both about the riots and the long list of famous Zoot Suiters who wore the attire the Los Angeles City Council had tried to ban: Cesar Chavez, Cab Calloway and Malcolm X, to name a few.</p><p>"This week, tonight, the Zoot Suit Riots were ongoing," he said. "This is what I want the younger generation to know.</p><p>Racial tensions at the time had been heightened by the now notorious <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-zoot-suit-riots-anniversary-20180604-story.html">Sleepy Lagoon murder trial</a>. After a young Latino man was killed in Southeast L.A., 300 suspects were rounded up, most of them Latino. Twenty-two boys were charged, fueling anti-Mexican sentiment.</p><p>Through the resolution, the city formally apologized for wielding their power to outlaw the </p>wide pegged  white-legged<p> trousers and billowy coats rather than cracking down on the white mobs perpetrating the violence. </p><p>The Los Angeles City Council and the City of Los Angeles must apologize for responding to these racialized attacks by attempting to pass an ordinance to ban wearing Zoot Suits rather than seeking to protect the community who was directly targeted by this brutal multi-day assault, the resolution said.</p><p>The celebration come on the heels of a similar <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/los-angeles-county-denounces-dark-chapter-of-zoot-suit-riots-80-years-later">apology</a> by Los Angeles County. Last month, the county voted unanimously to condemn the attacks and vowed to fight racial discrimination. </p>Times staff writer Julia Wick contributed to this report.                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The other, Jeff Ranen, recalled giving a rousing Jerry Maguire speech to convince colleagues to follow him out the door.</p><p>But over the weekend, Lewis Brisbois struck back. </p><p>In an extraordinary move, its management team directed the release of scores of emails in which Barber and Ranen used vile terms for women, Black people, Armenians, Persians, and gay men and traded in offensive stereotypes of Jews and Asians. In one fell swoop, the venerable firm managed to torpedo its new rival, destroy the defecting partners careers and send the legal establishment reeling.</p><p>The emails, stretching back 15 years, were head-spinning in their coarseness and vitriol. A Superior Court judge was called Sugar </p>Tits <p>Ts. Multiple female lawyers were referred to as "c</p>t<p>." The epithets fag and faggot were deployed as all-purpose insults. An Asian job applicant was denigrated for the supposed size of his genitalia. Ranen dismissed another job candidate with, How about someone whos not a Jew.</p><p>By Monday, the emails had been excerpted by the New York Post and the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, and the nascent firm Barber Ranen had collapsed.</p><p>"The last 72 hours have been the most difficult of our lives, as we have had to acknowledge and reckon with those emails," Barber and Ranen said in a joint statement announcing their resignations. "We are ashamed of the words we wrote, and we are deeply sorry."</p><p>Barber Ranens chief executive Tim Graves, a former Lewis Brisbois attorney, said in a statement that the remaining partners will form a new firm and asked for support while we heal and plan our path forward.</p><p>The roster of lawyers was stripped from the Barber Ranen website, and some had already asked for their old jobs back at Lewis Brisbois, a spokesperson said.</p><p>It was not all good news for the firm. Some saw the email release as a self-own for Lewis Brisbois, revealing a culture of bigotry thriving in some corners of the behemoth firm. Many objectionable messages were copied to co-workers, from junior associates to fellow partners.</p><p>I just dont understand that, said Ann Park, a corporate litigator and president of the L.A. County Bar Assn. It just reflects poorly on  obviously these lawyers  but also on their colleagues for not calling it out.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois recently retained a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to review internal practices, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>The men writing the emails were not junior employees, but influential veterans and supervisors. Barber was a member of the firms management committee, which governs its nearly 1,700 attorneys in 55 offices around the country, and Ranen had been the youngest person to make partner, according to his former firm biography. Both helped run its labor and employment practice, defending corporations against harassment and discrimination lawsuits.</p><p>Though the departure they instigated in early May represented about 8% of the firms lawyers, it came on top of an exodus earlier in the year of 30 others. Within days, the firms 87-year-old chair, Bob Lewis, who had founded it in 1979, stepped aside for a rejiggered management team.</p><p>Meanwhile, Barber and Ranens new practice was attracting positive coverage in legal news outlets. According to Lewis Brisbois, it was during this time that the firm received an anonymous complaint about the former partners. It specifically recommended the firm scrutinize the emails of both men, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Firm managers launched an investigation and were shocked to find dozens of emails  with unacceptable, prejudiced language aimed at our colleagues, clients, attorneys from other firms, and even judges, the firm said in a statement.</p><p>The firms leaders consulted ethics experts who laid out a variety of options: publish the emails on the Lewis Brisbois website; share the emails with partners at Barber and Ranens new firm; and file a complaint with the State Bar of California, which licenses attorneys, according to the person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Ultimately, firm leaders chose to provide the media with a curated, partly redacted set of correspondence  a decision that was presented as transparency and which many in the legal field saw as revenge delivered ice cold.</p><p>Scott Cummings, a UCLA law professor who teaches ethics, said that there was no legal requirement that the firm make the emails public, but that it was the ethically correct thing to do because it informed prospective employees and clients of the repugnant views the men held.</p><p>Bringing these things to light does go toward protecting the public and alerting the profession to conduct that should be stopped, Cummings said. Even if Lewis Brisbois was motivated by vengeance, he said, the benefits to the field and the public still stood. These things can happen simultaneously.</p><p>Barber and Ranen practiced in an area where company email accounts are routinely mined for evidence, and racist, sexist or other bigoted messages can translate to costly settlements or verdicts.</p><p>Yet both men appeared to revel in their flagrant disregard for professionalism and decency. In 2013, Ranen told Barber that if you want to have fun for a second, he should keyword search the words c and Jew on your email inbox and sent box.</p><p>It's like you know me, Barber replied.</p><p>The pair injected mundane work correspondence with antisemitism. Ranen repeatedly used Jew as a synonym for haggling over prices: I might be able to Jew them down to $390, he wrote in 2016. When Ranen alerted colleagues to bagels he had brought to the office in 2014, Barber replied, Jew c.</p><p>In a boasting 2012 email, Ranen told Barber, Gypsy is my new word to describe about half of the minorities in California. Generally with an Armo, Persian or middle eastern flair.</p><p>Over the next decade, Ranen invoked the gypsy moniker repeatedly to mock several attorneys, prompting one</p>  fellow colleague<p> at Lewis Brisbois to </p> confide in him <p>last year, Dirty Gypsy is my new favorite epithet.</p><p>Sex was another frequent topic. After a friend promised a 2015 trip to Las Vegas where debauchery level is unprecedented, Ranen said he would get a continuance in a federal trial to attend and informed others accompanying him, Were going to a strip club or bringing in hookers.</p><p>When a female lawyer asked for upgrades to the firm lactation room, Ranen forwarded it to a male colleague with speculation about her appearance after bearing two children. He then added, She could be 200 pounds and acne scarred and after all this time Id still f her.</p><p>The emails also include a seemingly gratuitous use by Barber of the n-word. After a colleague informed him that another participant in a 2013 mediation objected to the word being spoken, Barber replied, Got it. He then spelled out the word.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois redacted the names of many individuals who participated in the odious conversations, but the names of some maligned are visible. One is Linda Miller Savitt, an employment lawyer at a rival law firm who Ranen described as a real c in a 2018 email to two other lawyers.</p><p>Its very disappointing to learn this about colleagues, even if they are competitors, she told The Times. Savitt represents the newspaper in employment litigation.</p><p>Jonathan Delshad, an attorney who opposed Lewis Brisbois in a 2016 case, found out from The Times on Tuesday that Ranen had written of him to a co-worker, Tell him that hes the reason why most people hate Jews.</p><p>I make it a point not to get caught up in personal disputes, Delshad said, adding, I do my best to treat every human being with dignity and respect regardless of our position on a legal dispute.</p><p>Merle Vaughn, an attorney and legal recruiter specializing in finding diverse candidates, said that the emails raised the question of what office life had been like for women and minorities.</p><p>If they were putting that in writing, what were the quote-unquote microaggressions they had to endure to keep their job, said Vaughn, the managing partner in the L.A. office of Major, Lindsey &amp; Africa.</p><p>Their apparent comfort in putting offensive ideas in writing was evidence, she said, that they believe they are above it and they wont get caught.</p><p>Barber seemed to recognize as much. In 2015, he told an acquaintance, There is no NSFW for me, abbreviating "not safe for work."</p><p>"My average email would get someone fired," he added.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

And what does that mean when it does come?</p><p>A new study provides a possible answer  the drying <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-11-29/u-s-government-pledges-250-million-to-help-ailing-salton-sea">Salton Sea</a>, about 150 miles southeast of L.A., and the lack of sudden, major floodwaters funneling into it since it formed more than a century ago.</p><p>But one thing is certain. The drought of earthquakes on the San Andreas fault will not last. A drying Salton Sea may be helping delay the next Big One, but that could result in a more powerful quake when it does strike.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06058-9" target="_blank">study</a> published </p> Wednesday<p> in the journal Nature by scientists at San Diego State University and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego aimed to help explain why the southernmost tip of the San Andreas fault, close to the Mexican border, hasn't had an earthquake of a magnitude 7 or greater in about 300 years.</p><p>That's an unusually long gap. Other sections of the San Andreas have ruptured more recently. A section between Monterey County and San Bernardino County ruptured 166 years ago</p>1857<p>, and another portion ruptured in the great San Francisco earthquake 117 years ago</p>1906<p>.</p><p>In this southernmost section of the San Andreas, there have been seven major earthquakes between the 10th and 18th centuries. Some were probably separated by only a 40- or 50-year gap. For others, the gaps were probably as long as 280 years.</p><p>But it's been about three centuries  sometime between 1721 and 1731  since a temblor that was at least a magnitude 7 struck the southernmost section of the San Andreas.</p><p>"Yet we know that this portion of the fault has accumulated enough tectonic strain to produce such an event," said Ryley G. Hill, a doctoral candidate in geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and San Diego State who was lead author of the study. "And so this area actually poses the largest seismic hazard in all of California because it <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-07/devastating-turkey-earthquake-has-urgent-lessons-for-california">could severely damage the Los Angeles metropolitan area</a>." </p><p>A plausible earthquake that begins at the Salton Sea and ruptures through Palm Springs, continuing to Los Angeles County, is known as the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-06/earthquake-like-turkeys-would-devastate-southern-california">ShakeOut scenario</a>. That envisions a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that could result in 1,800 deaths and nearly 50,000 injuries  the deadliest quake in modern Southern California history. More than 1,000 of those deaths could occur in L.A. County alone. </p><p>So what could explain this unusually long quiet period?</p><p>Before the Salton Sea began to form in 1905  the result of both <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340038533_Formation_of_California's_Salton_Sea_in_1905-07_was_not_accidental" target="_blank">human and natural causes</a>  the low-lying Salton Trough, which sits below sea level, cycled over thousands of years between filling with water from the Colorado River and drying out.</p><p>The ancient predecessor to the Salton Sea is now referred to as Lake Cahuilla, which, when full, was 40 times larger in volume than its modern-day remnant. Lake Cahuilla was so vast that it stretched from the Coachella Valley south into Mexico and from as far west as Plaster City, Calif., to as far east as the Chocolate Mountains, according to study co-author Thomas Rockwell, a professor of geology at San Diego State.</p><p>A full Lake Cahuilla reached an elevation of about 40 feet above sea level, with a maximum depth of more than 300 feet before it started to spill again. By contrast, the Salton Sea currently<b> </b>reaches a <a href="https://www.iid.com/water/salton-sea#:~:text=With%20the%20high%20evaporation%20rates,feet%20below%20mean%20sea%20level." target="_blank">height</a> of about 240 feet below sea level, and with a maximum <a href="https://saltonsea.jpl.nasa.gov/site-description#:~:text=Salton%20Sea%20is%20approximately%2060,many%20species%20of%20migratory%20birds." target="_blank">depth</a> of about 50 feet.</p><p>Researchers found a pattern of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/colorado-river-in-crisis">Colorado River waters</a> pouring into Lake Cahuilla and accompanying large earthquakes before the lake periodically dried up. Lake Cahuilla is believed to have been full six times in the last millennium</p> : roughly  between the periods of 930 to 966, 1007 to 1070, 1192 to 1241, 1486 to 1503, 1618 to 1636, and 1731 to 1733<p>. </p><p>"By looking at the earthquake history, and its relationship to the lakes, we realize that most of the earthquakes have occurred when a lake was present," Rockwell said. </p><p>Of the seven major quakes researchers found, six occurred when Lake Cahuilla either was filling up or was at a peak level. </p>And  of the six times the lake filled during this period, all were accompanied by major quakes. <p>"Although previous studies were inconclusive about the temporal correlation of the earthquakes and lake episodes over the past millennium, the new earthquake history strongly suggests that all lake-filling events were accompanied by large earthquakes," the study said. "Such a correlation between the earthquake and lake timings is probably not coincidental."</p><p>The central reason <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-12/earthquake-science-definitions-causes-effects">why earthquakes occur</a> remains the same: </p>strain that <p>Strain has accumulated for decades or centuries because of tectonic plate movement, and the fault suddenly ruptures. Such a quake would've inevitably happened whether Lake Cahuilla was there or not. But its periodic refilling may have been the tipping point that triggered earthquakes when they did occur.</p><p>The decline of the Salton Sea, however, does not mean Southern California will forever be protected against a San Andreas earthquake as long as that area is </p>dessicating desiccating<p>. </p><p>"The idea that letting the Salton Sea dry up will keep us safe from earthquakes is definitely the wrong takeaway," said </p> Belle Philibosian<p>, a research geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey who wasn't affiliated with the study. </p><p>"Even if this ancient Lake Cahuilla or the Salton Sea never existed, these earthquakes would still eventually have happened anyway. They just happened a little bit sooner than they otherwise would have, due to the influence of the filling and emptying of the lakes over time," Philibosian said. "Even if the Salton Sea dries up completely, that next southern San Andreas earthquake is still going to happen. And we still need to be prepared for it."</p><p>Scientists have also noticed other examples in which the filling of reservoirs brought earthquake faults closer to failure, possibly advancing temblors, the study said. </p> A report published in 1997 <p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s000240050089" target="_blank">     noted  </a></p>  that seismicity "is likely to be more widespread and deeper for a larger reservoir than for a smaller one."  One documented example, cited in a study <p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/C-Scholz-2/publication/279695807_Two_types_of_reservoir-induced_seismicity/links/59f46772a6fdcc075ec373ca/Two-types-of-reservoir-induced-seismicity.pdf" target="_blank">     published  </a></p>  in 1988, involved the Koyna dam in western India. The reservoir behind the dam began to fill in 1962; five years later, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck, resulting in damage to the dam and a nearby town, and 200 people were killed. More recently, some scientists have <p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27812436/" target="_blank">     suggested  </a></p>  the filling of the Zipingpu reservoir in China could plausibly have helped advance the timing of the devastating magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Sichuan in 2008, which <p><a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usp000g650/impact" target="_blank">     killed  </a></p>  more than 69,000 people. It's unclear whether the new reservoir directly triggered the initial rupture of that quake. But scientists suggested it could have helped a small rupture along the fault to trigger larger ruptures elsewhere. In addition, earthquakes have been <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-man-made-quakes-20150424-story.html">     associated  </a></p>  with the injection, deep underground, of wastewater  left over from fracking operations to extract oil and natural gas.<p>Such activities increase something called pore pressure  essentially, increasing the fluids between the grains of a rock. "So if you have a rock and you fully saturate it with water, the pore pressure in it will increase due to the fluid inside it," Hill said. And that weakens the earthquake fault, making it more likely to rupture.</p><p>Increasing pore pressure is similar to turning on an air hockey table, Hill said. Low pore pressure would be like trying to nudge the puck when the table is off  it's harder, but you can still move it. Higher pore pressure would be like when the table is on, meaning it's much easier for the puck to move when given the same amount of push.</p><p>"That's exactly what the lake is doing. ... It's basically unclamping" the two sides of the fault, making them easier to move, resulting in an earthquake, Hill said. </p><p>That there isn't </p> a massive Lake Cahuillamuch of a lake<p> in this part of California anymore could mean more seismic strain is accumulating before it could rupture in a quake. That could make it possible for a larger magnitude event when an earthquake actually occurs. </p><p>"We could potentially have a much larger event, because more stress could be released," Hill said. </p> The last big earthquake in this area on the San Andreas caused one part of the fault to move past the other by 12 to 14 feet, making it a likely magnitude 7.3 or 7.4 earthquake. Rockwell said he expected the next one to be larger because it will have been at least 300 years since the last quake, with one side of the fault potentially moving past the other by 16 feet or so, or making it a magnitude 7.5. An open question is how much farther the San Andreas would rupture. Rarely, earthquakes from this area will rupture the fault not only through the Salton Trough and Coachella Valley regions, but propagate farther north, toward Riverside and San Bernardino.  "So one of the big questions is, if we have a large earthquake, will it potentially cascade to the north and produce an even larger earthquake," going through Los Angeles County and potentially all the way to the southern edge of Monterey County, Rockwell said.  The forming of the Salton Sea at the turn of the last century was small in comparison to the flows that previously filled ancient Lake Cahuilla. Nonetheless, the rapid increase of water flow into the newly forming body of water may have helped trigger a magnitude 6.1 earthquake in Brawley on April 18, 1906, Hill said. Scientists have previously suggested that quake was distantly triggered by the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which occurred 11 hours after the event in Northern California.  The Salton Sea has long been fed by Colorado River water draining from the farmlands in the Imperial Valley. The lake has been shrinking since the early 2000s, when the local irrigation district began transferring a portion of its water to urban areas. Its water is now about twice as salty as the ocean and continues to get saltier with evaporation, a shift that has caused <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/88077367-132.html">major declines in fish</a> and bird populations</p> . Based on current trends, the lake is projected to continue shrinking in the coming years. Along the retreating shorelines, state officials have been working on projects to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-11-29/u-s-government-pledges-250-million-to-help-ailing-salton-sea">control dust</a></p>  and build wetlands to provide wildlife habitat. A state-appointed panel last year <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-05/panel-rejects-idea-of-filling-salton-sea-with-ocean-water">     recommended against   </a></p> the idea of importing seawater to stop the Salton Sea from shrinking. The panel concluded that California shouldnt pursue such a plan, citing costs estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, harm to the coastal environment and a construction timeline that would take many years before any water would reach the lake. Advocates of importing water to the Salton Sea have strongly criticized the panel's conclusions, arguing the analysis was faulty.Times staff writer Ian James contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"There's a little bit of PTSD involved from that whole experience." </p><p>For much of Thursday, the air quality in Himrod was <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/?city=Himrod&amp;state=NY&amp;country=USA" target="_blank">classified as "unhealthy"</a> by the U.S. Air Quality Index</p> . Salpeter and Sweet <p>founded Sweet Farm in Half Moon Bay in northern California in 2015. But in August 2020, the sanctuary </p> was threatened by the<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-23/massive-california-firestorms-expected-to-worsen-with-more-lightning-winds">CZU Lightning Complex fire</a>, which ravaged San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties. In just four hours, a team of about 45 </p>people of <p>workers and community volunteers evacuated more than 140 animals, including cows, pigs, ducks, goats</p>,<p> and a 37-year old stallion called Sturgis</p> ,<p> to two other sanctuaries out of the raging fire's path.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/30/81/16bf9cb74d10802e39c9a86a57ee/la-na-pol-dc-wildfires-animal-sanctuary-sturgis.JPG"></figure><p>The fire, which <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/16/czu-lightning-complex-including-warnella-fire/" target="_blank">destroyed 1     ,  500 properties and consumed 86,000 acres</a>, ultimately spared the farm, but the sanctuary's team found the experience difficult</p> ,<p> nonetheless. Just going through that experience was extremely traumatic, it was stressful for the animals, for the team, and everyone involved, Salpeter told The Times on Thursday.</p><p>That close call was a catalyst. After years of wildfires, droughts and other extreme climate conditions, Salpeter and Sweet decided to relocate the animal sanctuary to Himrod, a town in western New York that they determined to be climate</p>-<p> stable and also close to Sweets hometown, Penn Yan.</p><p>If it wasnt that [CZU fire] that actually burned down the farm or caused catastrophe, when would the next one happen and would that be the one that actually burns it down? Salpeter said. We wanted to [move] on our own terms, before it was an eleventh</p> -<p>hour emergency.</p><p>Climate change has influenced other Californians' migration decisions. Stanford University's Nina Berlin Rubin and Gabrielle Wong-Parodi <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9399564/" target="_blank">found in a recent study</a> of 1</p> ,<p>100 California residents that "experiencing negative outcomes during the 2020 wildfire season was associated with an increased likelihood of intending to migrate." About a third of respondents intended to move in the next </p>5 five <p>years, and nearly a quarter of those likely to move reported that wildfire and smoke </p>impacted  influenced <p>their decision at least a moderate amount.</p><p>In May 2022, after months of planning, paperwork and animal blood tests, the </p> Sweet Farm team loaded t heir <p>cows, sheep, geese, pigs, llamas and chickens  and the aging Sturgis  onto two 18-wheeler trucks to make the 47-hour, nearly 3</p> ,<p>000-mile journey to Himrod.</p>That sense of safety and serenity was disrupted this week when wildfires burning in neighbouring Canada brought a smoky haze across New York state and the rest of the East Coast region of the United States. The East Coast which has largely been spared the smog and bright red sun as a result of wildfires is now getting a taste of harsh conditions that have become all too familiar in California and the West.<p>A year later, Salpeter says he and Sweet have no regrets. The lake provides them easy access to fresh water, and the region has a wine industry, which is a reminder of their former home. They are no longer under the near-constant threat of wildfires and other extreme climate events. </p><p>But this week's harsh conditions have also provided a reminder.</p><p>"No one is immune, no one is completely unaffected by climate change, no matter where you're located," Salpeter said.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Even with this influx of water, however, scientists said they dont yet know how much of it will make its way underground, and that it will likely only recoup a portion of the groundwater that has been extracted to supply agriculture during years of severe drought.</p><p>One good winter of rain and snow wont make up for years of extreme drought and extensive groundwater use, said Felix Landerer, a research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</p><p>We have accumulated quite a bit of water debt, groundwater debt, over the last 20 years, Landerer said.</p><p>Plotted on a chart, the satellite measurements </p> of the total amount of water in the region<p> form a line that, through seasonal ups and downs, has declined dramatically during the droughts from 2012-2016 and 2019-2022, reflecting major losses in total water resources. In 2023, the line has risen sharply.</p><p>Even though we had a lot of water gain, much of that is in the surface, Landerer said. That means much of the water remains in rivers, lakes, <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151422/california-reservoir-rebound?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank">reservoirs</a> and the soil, as well as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-15/planes-track-california-historic-snowpack">frozen in the snowpack</a>. So far, he said, not much has percolated down to aquifers.</p><p>It's actually pretty dry still down below, Landerer said. The key point is now, how much groundwater recharge will there be?</p><p>He and other scientists plan to track that as the snow melts and runoff courses through the Central Valley over the next several months.</p><p>In other <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-12-22/groundwater-depletion-is-accelerating-in-the-central-valley">recent research</a>, scientists have found that the pace of groundwater depletion accelerated in recent years during the drought.</p><p>Data for the last two decades  and earlier data going back to the 1960s  reveal successive drops in average water levels in a step-like pattern, with brief wet periods that have only temporarily slowed the declines.</p><p>Over the long term, groundwater is in a pretty steep decline, said J.T. Reager, a scientist at </p>the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  JPL<p>.</p><p>In wet years, we get a little bit of a recovery, and then in dry years, when there's not a lot of surface water or snowmelt, we tend to hit the groundwater really hard, Reager said. We never get the recovery to replace what we're drawing down, what we're using during the dry years.</p><p>The Central Valley is one of the worlds major farming regions, producing almonds, pistachios, grapes, walnuts, tangerines, rice and other crops, as well as cattle and dairy products.</p><p>The research is based on data collected from two NASA satellite missions. The current pair of satellites, which <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2018/05/22/nasas-satellites-track-shifts-water-supplies-worldwide/633652002/" target="_blank">launched into orbit</a> in 2018, track changes in Earth's gravity field to measure shifts in the total amounts of water, above and below ground.</p><p>The big question for this year, with all of the snow and rain that we received, is really how much of that rain and snowmelt is going to recharge that groundwater? Reager said. How much of that water can infiltrate the soil?</p><p>If all the water could be channeled underground, it would bring a tremendous recovery, he said. But he said its possible a lot of the water may not reach the aquifer.</p><p>Part of the reason relates to the valleys geology. There are clay layers in many areas that hinder the downward movement of water, while in other areas, water passes swiftly through <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-18/hidden-riverbeds-may-be-key-to-recharghing-aquifers">permeable layers of sediment</a>.</p><p>The water streaming down from the Sierra Nevada has inundated vast farmlands in the southern San Joaquin Valley, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-23/risk-of-catastrophic-flooding-has-diminished-in-tulare-lake">re-forming Tulare Lake</a>, which according to state officials now covers more than 113,000 acres, an area nearly as large as Lake Tahoe.</p><p>State water officials have sought to make it easier for local water districts and farms to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-21/california-looks-to-farmland-to-recharge-groundwater">use floodwaters to recharge depleted aquifers</a>.</p><p>Since December, the State Water Resources Control Board has issued 10 temporary permits for agencies to divert water for groundwater recharge projects, all but one of them in the Central Valley. The board also <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-11/california-will-use-floodwater-to-recharge-groundwater">approved a request</a> by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to divert floodwaters from the San Joaquin River and send much of that water flowing to lands where it spreads out and soaks into the ground.</p><p>These approvals allow for the diversion of more than <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2023/PR-on-1-million-AF-of-GW-Recharge.pdf" target="_blank">1.2 million acre-feet</a> of water  more supplies than Folsom Lake reservoir can hold  for groundwater recharge, wildlife refuges and other purposes. State officials say its the largest amount of water they have made available for groundwater replenishment in such a short period.</p><p>The state has taken unprecedented action to leverage the benefits of our recent wet weather by replenishing our groundwater resources, said Yana Garcia, secretary of Californias Environmental Protection Agency. She said its an example of how the state is taking steps to become more resilient as climate change makes extreme droughts and floods <a href="https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/news/151/warming-makes-droughts-extreme-wet-events-more-frequent-intense/" target="_blank">more intense and more frequent</a>.</p><p>State water officials have also been <a href="https://www.watereducation.org/western-water/high-tech-mapping-central-valleys-underground-blazes-path-drought-resilience" target="_blank">conducting aerial surveys</a> to map optimal areas for groundwater recharge, using helicopters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-18/hidden-riverbeds-may-be-key-to-recharghing-aquifers">equipped with electromagnetic imaging systems</a> that peer underground to reveal fast pathways for replenishing aquifers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the effects of overpumping have continued to affect rural communities, where some residents whose wells have gone dry <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-18/many-californians-with-dry-wells-face-long-wait-for-fixes">rely on trucked shipments of water</a> to fill their household tanks. The state has received reports of 249 dry household wells this year. State regulators have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-03/groundwater-plans-deemed-inadequate-by-california-regulators">told local groundwater management agencies</a> in large portions of the San Joaquin Valley that their plans for combating overpumping are inadequate.</p><p>Researchers have said addressing the long-term groundwater deficit will likely require taking large portions of farmland out of production and that planning will be key in transitioning some agricultural land to other purposes, such as solar farms, crops that consume less water or habitat restoration areas.</p><p>This extremely wet year, and the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-snowpack-melting-water-supply-flood/" target="_blank">historic levels of snowpack</a> that remain, offer the conditions for a rare experiment to see how much the groundwater levels might rise in the Central Valley, Reager said.</p><p>This year, we've got this nearly infinite supply of recharge, he said. How much can you actually get in the ground? And that's what we're looking to see.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That allows staff roughly six minutes to clean and feed each of the 350 to 400 cats and dogs housed at the facility on any given day, just over a third of the 15 minutes recommended by the <a href="https://jsmcah.org/index.php/jasv/article/view/42/19" target="_blank">Assn. of Shelter Veterinarians' guidelines of care</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the number of animals that wind up euthanized instead of getting adopted is climbing, the report said. The likelihood of a shelter dog getting euthanized appears to have doubled since 2018, according to data compiled by Michael Mavrovouniotis, a former O.C. Animal Care volunteer</p> who was let go of after speaking out about what he was observing<p>.</p> the story doesn't substantiate this and no comment from OC shelter/ AJ<p>"Status quo at the shelter is unacceptable," the grand jury wrote</p> in its report<p>. "Appropriate remedial steps must be taken as animal welfare is paramount!"</p><p>O.C. Animal Care officials declined to comment on the report. They were reviewing the grand jury's recommendations and must submit a formal response within 90 days, agency spokeswoman Jackie Tran said.</p><p>The grand jury suggested that O.C. Animal Care's adoption procedure may be making it harder for families to bond with dogs at the shelter, and less likely to take them home. </p><p>Cat and dog kennels used to be open to the public without prior notice, but the shelter <a href="https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/entertainment/story/2020-11-24/orange-county-animal-care-find-homes-animals" target="_blank">moved to an appointment-only system</a> to minimize contact during the height of the</p>  COVID-19<p> pandemic. Although the process has become somewhat less restrictive since then, walk-ins are limited and kennels remain off limits to visitors. </p><p>A petition that began in July asking O.C. Animal Care to return to pre-pandemic practices had garnered more than 22,000 signatures as of Wednesday.</p><p>"For many of the people I talk to, it's, what happens when a person is at the shelter?" Mavrovouniotis said</p> in an interview<p>. "Can they go to the kennel buildings and look at a large number of the available dogs so they can connect with an animal, which may be based on the way that animal is looking back at them or the way it's wagging its tail? Ya know, that whole impression one gets from an animal. That's the crux of the matter."</p><p>He </p>went on to <p>suggest</p> ed<p> that the current adoption procedure may be contributing to more dogs getting killed. Mavrovouniotis said the more time animals spend at a shelter without getting adopted, the more likely they become to develop problematic behaviors. The grand jury's report indicated that behavioral issues accounted for a significant portion of the increase in euthanized canines.</p><p>"It raises the question of whether the behavioral issues are a side effect of stays that are too long and the inadequate socialization," he said.</p><p>Cat euthanization has also been growing</p> , <p>according to the report. The </p>grand jury's<p> investigation found that the rise coincides with O.C. Animal Care's decision in early 2020 to end</p>  the a<p> practice </p> of known as<p> trap, neuter and return, known as TNR, in which animal control officials </p> pick up stray cats for sterilization before returning take stray cats to get fixed and return<p> them to where they had been living.</p><p>The decision was made after O.C. Animal Care received a cease-and-desist notice stating that TNR may violate laws prohibiting the abandonment of animals, according to the grand jury's report. However, the oversight body noted that the relevant law "has never been adjudicated in a reported California court decision."</p><p>The grand jury said</p> went on to note that<p> O.C. Animal Care resisted </p> its the jury's<p> efforts to learn more about the rationale to stop TNR. So far, it has not been able "to confirm the logic, reasoning or basis," to end preventive efforts to sterilize stray cats.</p><p>"The performance of the shelter has been getting worse because bad policies have this feedback loop effect," Mavrovouniotis said. "They don't just lead to one</p> -<p>step deterioration in performance, but they lead to ongoing deterioration in performance. And that's what we're seeing."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

BB-12's footprints have been discovered by California State Park lifeguards on beaches in the Malibu area, according to National Park Service officials. The young male bear is believed to have taken at least two separate night -time strolls, the most recent occurring near Leo Carillo State Beach. It is highly unusual for bears to wander onto the beach, park officials said.<p>"We don't see bears around here," said Ana Beatriz Cholo, spokesperson for the National Park Service. "That's just not their area."</p><p>But officials said the 3- or 4-year-old bear has been on the move in recent weeks, traveling across the mountains and toward the coast, and has most recently headed north from the Santa Monica Mountains toward Thousand Oaks, making the dangerous trip across the 101 and 118 freeways in late May. </p><p>"He hung around for a few weeks and then he started making his way up north," Cholo said. </p><p>The bear, estimated to be about 210 pounds when <a href="https://www.nps.gov/samo/learn/news/national-park-service-biologists-capture-a-black-bear-in-santa-monica-mountains-national-recreation-area.htm" target="_blank">he was first tagged</a> by biologists with the National Park Service on April 23, is the first bear captured and tagged in the Santa Monica Mountains. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/44/00/74fa1afa47d59e11275a51188079/paws-crop.jpg"></figure><p>According to the National Park Service, the nearest population of black bears lives in the Santa Susana Mountains north of the 118 freeway and, although there have been previous bear sightings in the Santa Monica Mountains in the past, there is no evidence of a population there since the 1800s.</p><p>But officials believe BB-12 has been in the Santa Monica Mountains for almost two years. </p><p>Now, Cholo said, BB-12 has even made an appearance in social media apps like Nextdoor, where residents from Newbury Park have reported sightings of the black bear. </p><p>Jeff Sikich, biologist with the park service, said BB-12 visited the far western end of Malibu, near Point Mugu Beach, on the night of April 30. </p><p>Then on May 6, the bear returned to the coast, this time near Leo Carrillo State Beach. </p><p>Since then, the bear appears to be heading north, Sikich said. </p><p>On May 30, the GPS tracker that was attached to the bear signaled that he had crossed the 101 freeway sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. on May 30. Officials are not sure exactly where he crossed the freeway, but believe it was somewhere between Borchard Road and Rancho Conejo Boulevard, Sikich said. </p><p>The following day, his GPS collar signaled that he crossed State Road 23. </p><p>Later that night, </p>his<p> BB-12 appeared to continue his trek north, crossing the 118 freeway on May 31 between 10 p.m. and midnight. </p><p>Bears in the region have been known to try to cross Southern California's freeways in the past, often with deadly results. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/santamonicamtns/photos/a-black-bear-was-struck-and-killed-by-a-vehicle-last-night-on-the-101-freeway-ne/10152168428373660/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfYHf4OjhFSLmsEjzZI9crg6r9u0SUJ73dmOollmoNUoE3B3ibUA_B3FwrjSh5V4bvY&amp;_rdr" target="_blank">In 2014</a>, a black bear was killed trying to cross the 101 freeway. </p><p>"It's pretty extraordinary that this bear safely crossed this busy freeway," Cholo said. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

A search turned up roughly 1,400 forged cards of various types</p> , <p>according to the federal court indictment.</p> This was around the time cloned EBT cards came onto the radar of a high-tech crimes task force that draws from multiple local law enforcement agencies. Bank debit cards had become harder to copy as chips became standard. Cloned <p><a href="https://edd.ca.gov/en/about_edd/the_edd_debit_card/" target="_blank">     Employment Development Department cards  </a></p> , used to pilfer people's COVID-era unemployment benefits, were falling out of fashion to clone as the pandemic ebbed and the money dried up. By summer 2022, EBT cards had become the card fraud flavor of the month, said Geoffrey Elliott, an L.A. County Sheriff's Department detective and member of the task force. Unlike in past schemes, however, the victims were exclusively low-income people.<p>In the last six months of 2021, EBT fraud cost the state $3.2 million in stolen funds, with losses surging to $51.9 million for all of 2022. Those losses includes cash aid meant for low-income families with children, called <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calworks" target="_blank">CalWORKs,</a> and food stamps, known as <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/inforesources/calfresh" target="_blank">CalFresh.</a> </p><p>In the first three months of this year, the total loss was $31.6 million.</p><p>In California, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-08/ebt-fraud-la-county">EBT theft victims</a> are supposed to be reimbursed for stolen money within two weeks of filling out the proper paperwork. But the wait times can </p>now <p>stretch for weeks as overwhelmed social service agencies try to wade through the </p>exploding <p>rising number of fraud claims.</p><p>Most of the theft takes place at ATMs by lower-level crime-ring members. But authorities say these operations have also found ways to turn stolen food stamp benefits into cash  by racking up exorbitant bills at grocery stores and </p>then <p>reselling what they buy.</p><p>This past fall, a Romanian couple spent roughly $110,000 in purloined food stamps across five trips to a downtown San Diego grocery store, according to a federal complaint. The couple allegedly spent as much as $26,312 in a single grocery store run  nearly all of it on pallets of Red Bull. </p><p>Paul Radu, a </p> Romanian<p> journalist who co-founded the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, dates the rise of Romanian skimming groups back to the early days of the internet.</p><p>The country has long had among the world's <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country">fastest internet speeds,</a> which in the 1990s gave criminals an advantage in the burgeoning world of online fraud.</p><p>Romanian organized crime groups have since come to dominate in the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/card-skimming-fraud-snap-ebt/" target="_blank">billion-dollar skimming industry,</a> Radu said. </p><p>Right now, if you go to the dark web, what you can see is that there are batches of cloned cards that you can buy, he said in an interview.</p> <p>Three years ago, Radu's news outlet <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/how-a-crew-of-romanian-criminals-conquered-the-world-of-atm-skimming/the-riviera-maya-gang-global-atm-bandits/" target="_blank">exposed</a> a massive ATM skimming gang operating along the coast of Mexico. In that case, the groups came from the Romanian city of Craiova. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles recently charged two men from Craiova, </p>referred to described<p> in court documents as a known haven for ATM skimming crews."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3f/10/65bf2ec74ae89dda215a21ebd217/la-me-ebt-skimming01.jpg"></figure><p>All the men arrested in May 2022 at the Mid-City rental said they were from Transylvania, authorities said. A 24-year-old arrested at the house told a judge that he dreamed of coming to California for its cultural diversity, but once he got here found himself surrounded by the wrong people. Another man wrote that he was struggling to find work in Romania due to the influx of Ukrainians displaced by war</p>,<p> and desperately needed money for his newborn daughter.</p><p>Irvine-based attorney Brian Doyle said his client</p>,<p> Maria Vaduva, arrested near a Placentia ATM in March, was similarly desolate and trying to provide for her children. He said she was a<b> </b></p>clear <p>pawn in a </p>much more <p>complex operation. </p><p>Some higher-up clearly must have put themselves into her life</p>,<p> and induced her allegedly to assist a larger organization, Doyle said. Vaduva has pleaded not guilty to federal charges and is in custody.</p><p>Attorney Donald J. Matson in Pasadena said his client</p>,<p> Constantin Rotaru</p>,<p> was </p>himself <p>a victim of the scammers, having become accidentally entangled with the group on a visit to the United States. Rotaru also pleaded not guilty. </p><p>"My understanding is that at the coffee shops and other places that non-English speakers congregate, people approach speaking their language, and recruit them for the footwork part of the scheme," Matson said in an email. </p> Some of those arrested said they entered illegally through Mexico, according to court affidavits, while others claim to have chosen more unorthodox points of entry. Two men arrested near an ATM on March 1 said they made it from the Bahamas to Miami by boat. Another allegedly rode from Ontario, Canada, to Marine City, Mich., on a    J et    S ki. Once here, the crews operate in an "informal hierarchical structure"  various groups each with its their own leader  FBI Agent Rene Persaud wrote in an affidavit.  Decentralization is part of what has made Romanian skimming crews so difficult to tackle, said Louise Shelley, director of George Mason Universitys Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption <p><a href="https://traccc.gmu.edu/" target="_blank">     Center  </a></p> . If you have a network organization, where the people dont know each other, then they cant rat on each other, Shelley said. A sluggish bureaucracy  easily exploited by sophisticated criminals  hasn't helped   .  <p>Local public assistance advocates say they're frustrated with the state Department of Social Services, which has not publicly given a timeline of when chipped EBT card may be rolled out.</p><p>We all agree that there's no financial institution that would ever treat their money this way. They would never let it be lost this way. They'd be bankrupt, said Heather Tallent, an investigator with the Ventura County </p> d<p>istrict </p> a<p>ttorneys </p> o<p>ffice. So why is it not safeguarded?</p><p>Jason Montiel, a spokesperson for the agency, said a specific timeline is not available for implementing cards with chip technology. He said the department is actively working to develop and deploy the use of chip and tap technologies on EBT cards and </p>noted<p>that there are complex technological changes required to get it done.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/5d/19/fd2f89ff40f2ac1a6c5d4a32909c/evidence-skimming-arrest-2.jpg"></figure><p>In the meantime, local and federal authorities continue to make arrests, though some law enforcement officials say these arrests have </p> beenproven<p> a weak deterrent. Those facing state charges have usually been released on bail or on their own recognizance.

Several people received more than 10 deliveries; one person got about 30, another about 40. Some residents were bemused, others annoyed. The unsolicited deliveries were in the names of other people, and mostly came from McDonald's and Starbucks. The food was paid for  and sometimes came with tips for the drivers, who, recipients said, mostly seemed undisturbed.</p><p>It was an odd (and rich) caloric tapestry. One order included four McDonalds McGriddles (two sausage, two chicken). Another consisted of a lone Starbucks iced matcha tea latte with a mocha drizzle. That concoction was far more complex than the beverages that most people received: kid-size cartons of milk and bottles of water  sometimes only one per order. It was these deliveries  the simplest of drinks in the smallest of quantities  that seemed to really weird people<b> </b>out.</p> A tasty L.A. mystery: Unwanted Uber Eats food deliveries vex Highland Park neighborhood<p>But residents said they hadn't received any additional unsolicited food in the weeks after The Times on May 15 published </p>an online<p> a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">story on their experience.</a> That is, until Perrine told me about the reemergence of the phenomenon.</p><p>Her note reignited the low-stakes </p> mystery<p>, which has highlighted the degree to which anonymity is woven into transactions carried out on the platforms of food delivery services, which have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-09-19/the-state-of-food-delivery">grown dramatically</a> since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The free fast-food dispatches have led the denizens of Range View to develop a host of theories that would explain the bizarre situation. Others have weighed in too, including residents in Westwood Hills, where a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">similar episode unfolded</a> in late January and early February.</p><p>People in that tony Westside community posited that the unwanted orders were the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">work of a burglary ring</a> that was casing houses by sending them food to see if anyone was home. No crime has been linked to the deliveries.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/46/6d/d7660bbf430b9e4eab6a819c40f7/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-09.jpg"></figure><p>As various hypotheses were cast aside  including one that speculated<b> </b>the orders were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">part of an experiment</a> conducted by a college psychology class and another that suggested they were the work of scammers phishing for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">drivers' Uber Eats login credentials</a>  a leading theory emerged. It centers on the deliveries being the ploy of criminals who are testing stolen credit cards by making small charges with them via Uber Eats.</p><p>I planned to ask residents about that during a visit to the neighborhood on May 31. But first I placed an Uber Eats order. I parked on Range View under a sky lidded with clouds and </p> chose<p> a coffee and a juice from Starbucks  the sort of small, inexpensive selection that's typical of the undesired </p> deliveries<p>. My aim was to talk </p> to <p>the courier transporting the drinks. The Uber Eats app said her name was Wysper and I hoped for some answers  the sort that the company hadn't yet provided. </p><p>A spokeswoman for Uber, the San Francisco-based parent of Uber Eats, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">previously told The Times</a> that the company was investigating the matter and had banned some accounts from the platform while taking other unspecified steps to prevent misuse of the service. The reports of unsolicited deliveries are concerning, the Uber spokeswoman said in an April statement. We ... will not hesitate to take additional action if the unsolicited orders continue.</p><p>Asked to comment for this story, an Uber spokesman replied with that statement from April. </p> He did not answer a handful of questions, including one inquiring about the source of the offending orders.<p>Perhaps Wysper would have some insight?</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/97/40/782a2fc641ea9da93b26a09ce9d8/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks-7.jpg"></figure><p>A few minutes later, a red Nissan Versa pulled up to the curb and a smiling woman stepped out of the car with a Starbucks bag. She explained her name was Wysper Samone. I launched into a spiel about the situation.</p><p>"Oh, wow," said Samone, offering what figures to be the only appropriate response when a </p> Starbucks run <p>unexpectedly turns into an interview.</p><p>Samone said she hadn't made other deliveries on Range View and wasn't aware of the strange orders in Highland Park. But she did say<b> </b>that something similar had happened near Pico Rivera. She seemed busy, so I wished her well.</p><p>I reached Samone the next day by telephone and asked if she had a theory that would explain the phenomenon. But she demurred.</p><p>"I just pick up </p> and<p> deliver," Samone said. "That's all."</p>'Low-tier' criminals?<p>There was one house I knew I had to visit. </p><p>Back in March, there'd been a sign on its front door that exhorted Uber Eats couriers to "NOT LEAVE ANY ORDERS!"</p><p>Richie Kulchar opened his door, saw my Starbucks </p> bag<p> and started to laugh. He thought I was a neighbor inquiring about the new deliveries. That would have made sense: Three residents on Range View told The Times that they had received multiple orders in recent days; two other people who lived nearby, Perrine included, said </p>that<p> they had gotten several deliveries in mid-May. </p><p>"Every day it's one milk in a bag," said Kulchar, a commercial producer and director who lives on Avenue 50 near Range View. "I'm a pro at this now, I'm checking my credit cards, my Uber Eats account  none of it is showing up on there."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/df/dc/c880bd554e78a6657421116aaa9f/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-06.jpg"></figure><p>At first, Kulchar said, he was amused by the situation. But after </p> enduring<p> five </p> deliveries<p> from May 26 to May 30, he's not laughing.<b> </b>The orders are often brought by couriers who pound on his front door, upsetting his dog, Molly.</p><p>"Now, I'm just annoyed with Uber Eats," Kulchar said. "I throw it away, which is a bummer because I really don't like wasting an unopened milk. But what am I going to do, stock it in my fridge?"</p><p>Kulchar believes the </p> deliveries<p> are the byproduct of "low-tier" criminals attempting to validate stolen credit card numbers. Range View resident <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">Kelsey McManus agrees</a>. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/15/81/23c59dd04c20af2c655af32c0668/la-me-unwanted-uber-eats-delivery-01.jpg"></figure><p>She<b> </b>speculated that the effort could be AI-driven, noting that when some Uber Eats drivers have attempted to telephone the people who've placed the orders, the calls go to "nonexistent numbers." </p><p>We joked about using ChatGPT to solve the mystery. But when I queried the AI, it said that it couldn't "investigate specific incidents."</p><p>Asked if the unsolicited orders were part of an effort by criminals to test stolen credit card numbers, a spokesman for Uber said that it was a possibility the company was investigating. </p><p>Computer security and e-commerce expert </p>Dr.<p> Clifford Neuman wondered if the offending orders were placed by new Uber Eats accounts that were used just once, or whether they came from long-standing ones that made the purchases routinely. He also raised the issue of credit card charge-backs. </p><p>"You would think now </p> ... <p>months after this started, you would have gotten the charge-backs  which Uber would know about  when people saw it on their credit card statements," said Neuman, director of the USC Center for Computer Systems Security. </p><p>The Times asked Uber whether the unwanted orders have resulted in charge-backs and for information about the accounts making the purchases. </p> A spokesman said Uber could not share details of bad actors' methods and the company's response to them, because doing so would reveal internal processes to the offending parties.A 'boring-ass' prank?<p>A gnawing desire to "to know the answer</p>,<p>" has stuck with McManus.</p><p>"When you first tell people, they all go, 'Oh, it's a prank,'" </p>"<p> she said. "But it seems so much more systemic than that."</p><p>In an era of popular television shows built around elaborate reality-distorting ruses  among them Amazon Freevee's "Jury Duty" and HBO's "The Rehearsal"  the notion that the unwanted deliveries are part of a made-for-TV stunt has come up. But there's no evidence this is the case. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/92/ce/72a50b1b40debd4d1c3839a4fc00/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-08.jpg"></figure><p>Some residents think</p>,<p> maybe this is a prank of the more old-fashioned sort: one masterminded by college students.</p><p>Occidental College is<b> </b>just down the road from the affected portion of Range View, an eclectic stretch of about 25 houses and apartment buildings between Avenue 49 and Avenue 50. There is even a fraternity house on the block.</p><p>Wanting to ask the frat brothers if they had the inside scoop, I trudged up the front stairs of the house, snaking past a </p>front <p>yard teeming with overgrown weeds and discarded cans of Modelo Especial and Michelob Ultra. But no one was home  the </p>school<p> semester had ended. Another dead end.</p><p>Kulchar, in any case, doubted the theory.</p><p>"That's the most boring-ass prank that a college student could pull," he said.</p> Who's sending mystery Uber Eats orders to L.A. neighborhoods? The plot thickens<p>Walking past discarded ketchup packets that lined the stairs of the frat house, I was reminding of something </p> mentioned by <p>L.A.-based horror writer Lisa Morton, who called the whole episode a "cosmic comedy."</p><p>"Nothing really harmful is happening to these people, but it is beyond annoying and somewhat disturbing," said Morton, who contributed an unnerving short story to the 2021 anthology <a href="https://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/speculative-los-angeles/" target="_blank">"Speculative Los Angeles,</a>" which offers largely bleak and futuristic visions of the city. "Maybe they have moved past it and accepted that it is going to be uncomfortable. Maybe that's how it is with these dystopian things we confront."</p><p>There was certainly something dystopian about the food waste generated by the ordeal. Some residents said they've eaten the free </p> fare<p> or donated it, but several others, Kulchar included, have been throwing it away. Morton gets it.</p><p>Food cloaked in mystery  mystery food, if you will  doesn't necessarily go down so easily. </p><p>"If I were getting this food, I'd be freaked out," she said. "I wouldn't eat it."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Off the coast of California, <p>orcas are most commonly seen in the deep canyons of Monterey Bay, about 100 miles south, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch.

If a dog attacks, postal workers are trained to stand their ground and protect their body by placing something between them and the dog  such as a mail satchel  and to use dog repellent, if necessary, the USPS said. Letter carriers also have tools to flag dogs along their routes, including an alert feature on their scanners and warning cards that can be inserted with sorted mail.</p><p>Pet owners can help protect mail carriers by keeping dogs inside, on a leash or behind a fence when mail-time rolls around, the USPS said.</p><p>When letter carriers deliver mail in our communities, dogs that are not secured or leashed can become a nemesis and unpredictable and attack, said Leeann Theriault, USPS employee safety and health awareness manager.</p><p>Threatening dogs have in some cases caused disruptions to mail service.

Among other problems, they say</p> ,<p> current law prevents officials from verifying whether </p> claims of senior water rights<p> are valid, </p> ordering those water users to reduce usage, or imposing fines that are large enough to penalize<p> those who flout the rules.</p>  Three <p>bills</p>  gaining<p> momentum in the Legislature are seeking to change that, even as they draw heated opposition from water </p> agencies<p> and agricultural groups.</p> <p>These bills show that the Legislature is taking a serious look at bringing more comprehensive and consistent regulation to water rights  and empowering the State Water Resources Control Board to do the job California needs it to do, said Nell Green Nylen, a senior research fellow at the UC Berkeley School of Laws Wheeler Water Institute.</p><p>Green Nylen is part of a group of legal experts who recently published a <a href="https://legal-planet.org/2023/04/24/managing-water-scarcity/" target="_blank">state-funded report</a> outlining recommendations for legislative </p>reforms <p>and policy changes </p> to improve oversight and management of the water rights system<p>. She said the bills in the Legislature would partially address some of their recommendations, while still leaving some concerning gaps in the states ability to manage water scarcity.</p><p>One bill  <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1337" target="_blank">AB 1337</a>, introduced by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland)  would clarify that the State Water Board has authority to issue a curtailment order for all diverters, including senior right</p> s <p>holders. </p> The legislation was drafted in response to a recent decision by an appeals court, which sided with water agencies in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta that had challenged the states authority to order cuts. In its decision, the court suggested its up to the    Legislature   Legisalture to determine whether its time to update the law.<p>Another measure approved by the Senate, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB389" target="_blank">SB 389</a>, would give the State Water Board the authority to investigate and verify whether the claims of senior rights holders are valid and accurate.</p><p>They've got to have more tools at their disposal to better understand the rights system as it exists, said Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), who introduced the proposal.</p><p>Californias existing water rights <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-california-water-rights-20140819-story.html">allocate far more water</a> than is available in an average year, Allen </p> noted<p>, and state water regulators are </p>charged  tasked<p> with making the system work through increasingly intense droughts.</p><p>The change would help the water rights system function the way its supposed to, before we run out of time to fix it</p> ,<p> Allen said.</p><p>Another bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB460" target="_blank">AB 460</a>, would strengthen the State Water Boards enforcement powers to stop illegal water diversions and would sharply increase fines for violators.</p><p>The bill is intended to prevent the sort of violations that occurred in August in the Shasta River watershed, when farmers and ranchers </p>that  who<p> belong to the Shasta River Water Assn. <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/article268432332.html" target="_blank">defied a curtailment order</a> for eight days and diverted more than half the rivers flow, flouting requirements aimed at protecting salmon. The State Water Board fined the association the maximum amount for the violation: $4,000, which <a href="https://legal-planet.org/2023/04/24/managing-water-scarcity/" target="_blank">worked out to about $50</a> for each of its members.</p><p>The case led to widespread calls for larger fines and stronger enforcement powers.</p><p>If we have scofflaws out there taking water that is not theirs, then it really messes up the entire system, said Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda), who introduced the bill. </p><p>The bill would give the State Water Board the authority to issue temporary orders to stop the illegal taking of water, and would increase fines for violations</p>  to up to $10,000 per day, plus $2,500 per acre-foot of water diverted<p>. </p> (An acre-foot is 325,851 gallons, or enough to cover one acre a foot deep.)<p>Some environmental groups and tribes have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-03-06/is-californias-antiquated-water-rights-system-racist">called for a major overhaul</a> of the states water rights, arguing that the current system was built on a foundation of violence against Native people, the taking of land from tribes, and systemic racism that long prevented people of color from securing water rights.</p><p>Supporters of the reform proposals in the Legislature say the bills arent meant to radically change the existing system, but rather to make a dysfunctional system work.</p> These modest changes are a first step in retrofitting the water rights system for the 21st century challenges ahead, said Amanda Fencl, a senior climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. She said the measures <p><a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/amanda-fencl/ca-legislature-could-make-overdue-changes-to-water-rights/" target="_blank">     offer critical updates  </a></p>  to enable the State Water Board to make informed and timely water management decisions and build climate resilience for the future.<p>The proposals are facing opposition from </p> many<p> water agencies and groups representing the agriculture industry.</p><p>The three bills all create increased uncertainty in the water supply, which would make it harder for growers to plan  and could result in fewer planned acres of food grown, said Gail Delihant, senior director of California government affairs for Western Growers, which represents more than 1,500 crop growers, packers and shippers.</p><p>Delihant said the measures represent attempts to destabilize the water rights system in California.</p><p>Also opposing the bills is the Ass</p>ociatio<p>n. of California Water Agencies, or ACWA, which represents about 460 public agencies that deliver water to cities and farms. Kristopher Anderson, a legislative advocate for ACWA, said the bills present a foundational change in the way Californias water rights system is implemented, managed, and enforced.</p><p>They would authorize the State Water Board to impose punitive penalties on even law-abiding water right holders, curtail water rights in any year, and strip entities of their water rights, Anderson said. </p> This package of legislation would create significant uncertainty, and lead to unintended consequences, for not just water right holders themselves, but communities and businesses across the state that depend on a reliable water supply. Anderson said water agencies that belong to the association agree that higher fines are necessary to deter violations, such as those that occurred on the Shasta River last year. But he and other opponents argued the proposal is overly broad and goes beyond what is necessary. In a <p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23833071-2023-05-12_ab-1337-assembly-appropriations-coalition-letter" target="_blank">letter</a></p>  opposing Wicks bill, representatives of dozens of water districts and agriculture industry groups said they support proposals to modernize administration of the water rights system by improving how the state collects and manages data, and by deploying more stream gages, among other steps. They argued that as it stands, the proposal threatens to remake the way water rights are managed in California by employing a top-down approach that would override decades of successful collaborative water management practices. State officials are working on a project to <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-27/can-california-water-rights-enter-the-digital-age">     modernize Californias water rights information system  </a></p>  by digitizing about 7 million pages of paper records. But officials have said that even those extensive records in many cases dont include original documents that show proof of pre-1914 water rights, which were grandfathered in under the 1913 Water Commission Act.    That act    , which established a permit process for rights from then on. In a <p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23833131-2023-2-18_hearing-on-water-rights-presentation" target="_blank">     February meeting  </a></p> , state officials said there are currently about 2,600 riparian and pre-1914 water rights claims in the San Joaquin River watershed, and more than 3,900 rights claims in the Sacramento River watershed. The rights are held by various entities and individuals, among them agencies that supply cities and agricultural irrigation districts supplying farms that produce nuts, cotton, rice and other crops.<p>In their recent report, Green Nylen and other water law researchers <a href="https://legal-planet.org/2023/04/24/managing-water-scarcity/" target="_blank">recommended various changes</a> to establish what they say would be a fair and effective framework for curtailing water rights. They said that the Legislature should clarify, among other things, that the State Water Board has broad authority to order curtailments for all diverters, including those with the oldest rights.</p><p>The researchers said the State Water Board needs to implement curtailments on a regular basis, not only in times of extreme crisis or only in certain watersheds. They noted that other Western states routinely curtail water rights in this way.</p><p>Drought response has been improvised, spotty</p>,<p> and belated, said Dave Owen, a professor at UC College of </p>// the ?// <p>Law in San Francisco.</p><p>If you talk to people at the board, they will bluntly tell you they're incredibly frustrated with their inability to gather information that they think they need. And then there are anemic enforcement mechanisms, Owen said. We just have this huge mismatch between major problems, big expectations for the agency and a fairly weak set of implementation tools. And it just means that we sort of default to the status quo. We default to improvisation or we default to letting people just kind of do what they want with water  unless it is so egregiously obvious that there is a problem that we have to step in.</p><p>Michael Kiparsky, director of the Wheeler Water Institute at the UC Berkeley School of Law, said its vital that state officials look ahead now to improve how the system functions to respond to the next drought. </p><p>"Our system for water administration in California just doesn't work," Kiparsky said. </p> "It doesn't work because the state doesn't have the tools it needs to do the basics.    Those basics include figuring out who should have the right to divert water from rivers and streams at any particular time, and telling those who should not be diverting water that they can't. It's a very basic function.  "                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Leg warmers, for example, are back. </p><p>"They are clinging with white-knuckle fear to the last bit of power they have," Roma said</p> <p>of the far-right agitators, just as ultra-conservatives did the last time California tried to clear its schools of anything hinting at gender diversity. </p><p>More than 75 laws outlawing a range of gender-related issues  from talking about sexuality in classrooms to holding drag performances in public  have been passed by statehouses nationwide this year. Republican standard-bearers including Ron DeSantis, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marjorie Taylor Green</p> e<p> have made anti-LGBTQ+ hate their brand, and there is real concern that our current Supreme Court will overturn <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-supreme-court-gay-marriage-decision-20150626-story.html">Obergefell vs. Hodges</a>, the landmark 2015 case that legalized same sex-marriage nationwide. </p><p>Hard to believe it's 2023, especially because California has been here, done this, circa 1978 with the Briggs Initiative, also known as Proposition 6. That's when voters considered giving school boards the power to fire gay and lesbian teachers and anyone who openly supported gay rights. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative, named for then-State Sen. John Briggs, a conservative from Orange County, also pitted LBGTQ+ rights against parental rights. The initiative posited</p> <p>that allowing gay and lesbian teachers in classrooms was a danger to kids, because such educators would "recruit" students into their "lifestyles." </p><p>"I don't understand why we have to send our children to sit in front of a homosexual teacher for eight hours," this newspaper reported Briggs saying in July 1977. "We can't risk our children."</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>"Save the children" is nothing new  just a recycled attack, dusted off and freshened up for another generation and supercharged <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-07/how-qanon-has-hijacked-hollywood-movies-for-conspiracy-theories">through the QAnon conduit of social media</a> to serve the purposes of a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-25/california-takes-lead-on-hate">far-right intent on undermining democracy</a> and maintaining the shaky status quo of power. Remember when we were supposed to be saving the children from the adrenochrome-drinking Democrats ritually abusing them</p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/02/16/pizzagate-qanon-capitol-attack/" target="_blank">underneath a D.C. pizza parlo</a>r?</p><p>If those who oppose diversity can't outright try to ban the humans this time, they will ban the ideas, purposefully riling up supporters by conflating inclusion with indoctrination, and "grooming" with existing. Because really, who doesn't want to save the children if the threat feels real?</p><p>Just like now, the whole Briggs mess back then emanated from</p> <p>Florida  specifically in Dade County where Anita Bryant, a pop singer better known for her role as the spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, in 1977 spearheaded a "Save the Children" campaign to repeal a law that protected gay and lesbian people from job and housing discrimination. She successfully argued that she had a right to control "the moral atmosphere in which my children grow up."</p><p>Her campaign was a backlash to a decade of expanding recognition of gay civil rights after the Stonewall riots in 1969. It sparked a national movement that Briggs picked up on, with Bryant's help. </p><p>While Bryant's campaign was successful, it fueled a fierce response from California's LGBTQ+ community. On the night Bryant's ordinance passed in Florida, politician Harvey Milk, then a young member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, led a protest of thousands down Castro Street. </p><p>After the Briggs Initiative made it onto the California ballot, collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures, Milk was among its most vocal critics. In a memorable speech on the steps of San Francisco's City Hall, he spoke of the need to keep California a place of hope and acceptance. </p><p>"(T)he young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, and the Richmond, Minnesotas, who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant on television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope," Milk said. "And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right."</p><p>That's the Harvey Milk whose legacy was recently debased by board members in the Temecula Valley Unified School District, where a conservative majority refused to adopt a new social studies curriculum because Milk was mentioned in a few pages of history materials. That is what erasure means: not allowing future generations to believe in hope for the oppressed, making them feel alone and wrong. </p><p>Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Atty. Gen. </p>eral <p>Rob Bonta announced </p> that <p>they are investigating Temecula's action as a possible violation of state law. </p><p>The Briggs Initiative was ultimately defeated by more than a million votes, despite initial polling that predicted easy passage. The tipping point was when former Gov. Ronald Reagan came out against it, along with then-Gov. Jerry Brown and then-President </p>Jimmy<p> Carter.</p><p>Which brings me to Monday and Sister Roma at the Capitol. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/18/5a/76043a0a4908926752432fdee4ed/unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>I met Roma in a room full of queer leaders at a reception for Pride Month at the Capitol, where 16 LGBTQ+ activists were honored by the Senate and Assembly. Also in the room were the LGBTQ+ powerhouses of the Legislature, where more than 10% of elected officials now identify as something other than heterosexual. </p><p>It was a room you would not find in Kansas, Florida, Nebraska  or anywhere in 1978. Along with Sister Roma, resplendent in a royal blue feather headdress, those honored included tennis legends Billie Jean King and Rosemary Casals; Phil Collum, the first openly gay assistant chief of police in Chula Vista; Janessa Goldbeck, a former Marine captain running for office in San Diego, and others you perhaps have never heard of, but who are engaged in lives of service to help make this state a better place. </p><p>The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have given more than $887,000 to charities since 2000, including the St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church Fund an Immigrant Program, AIDS Housing Alliance / SF and the Bay Area Rainbow Symphony. That's</p> <p>a bit more than the $1,500 they raised at their first fundraiser in 1980 for gay Cuban refugees. The Sisters have come a long way, but never strayed from their mission: to promulgate universal joy and expiate stigmatic guilt.</p><p>"I've never come from a place of hate," said Sister Roma, whose blue eyes are kind and unflinching. </p><p>"It actually hurts" that people believe she's ridiculing anything, she told me. But "visibility without fear encourages others," and so she and her sisters will continue to do what they do. </p><p>Each of the honorees walked down the center aisles of the Senate and Assembly to receive gilt-framed resolutions honoring their work. Republicans walked out of the chamber</p> <p>both times Sister Roma received her commendation. And a few hundred protesters gathered outside, allegedly upset by the "mockery" that Sister Roma and her order represent to the Catholic Church, which, let's remember,</p> <p>is facing bankruptcies across California as the financial toll of sexual abuse lawsuits mount</p> s<p>. </p><p>But as Senate Pro Tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), the first gay woman to hold her post, told me at the reception, there has been a "sea change" in who holds power in California and there will be no going back to 1978. </p><p>"This comes down to freedom," Atkins said. Not just protecting it, but advancing it. </p><p>Earlier in the day, on the same steps where the protest against Sister Roma took place, LGBTQ+ legislators announced they are pursuing a state constitutional amendment for the 2024 ballot that would repeal Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative that banned same-sex marriage in California. Yes, it is still in California's Constitution despite being overturned by courts. It reads: "Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.</p><p>If the U.S. Supreme Court does overturn the federal right to same-sex marriage, having that nullified proposition on the books could be a problem in California. So as state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), one of the authors of the amendment, put it, "we need to be on the offensive." </p><p>Which brings to mind another quote from Milk. </p><p>"Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders," he said, "and by those who are themselves gay, those who are visible."</p><p>With activists like Sister Roma and elected officials like Atkins and Wiener in office across the state, we are on the offensive. For all the hate that is out there, churned from the basest of motives and used to exploit parents, this is not Florida and it is not 1978. </p><p>In California, visibility and equality may not be perfect. But unlike leg warmers, closets are never coming back. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The agency closed the application portal at the end of March 2022. </p><p>A surge in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-03-17/rental-assistance-in-california-how-to-apply-deadlines">denials beginning after the closure</a> propelled advocates to sue, alleging that eligible renters were rejected and left without financial aid. By July, around <a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/ca-rental-assistance">30%</a> of applicants had been denied assistance from the program, even though</p> <p><a href="https://nationalequityatlas.org/CARentalAssistance">93%</a> were likely </p> <p>eligible for debt relief, according to </p> the <p>National Equity Atlas, an organization that reports on racial and economic equity.</p><p>The way the program was set up was not responsive to the population it was meant to serve, </p> said <p>Faizah Malik, senior staff attorney at Public Counsel, a nonprofit law firm that helped represent the community advocacy organizations that sued the state.</p><p>Tenant advocates <a href="https://wclp.org/press-release-lawsuit-filed-against-ca-hcd-for-violating-due-process-rights-in-emergency-rental-assistance-program/" target="_blank">sued</a> the housing department </p> in June 2022<p> for distributing funds through an application process they characterized as muddled with barriers for low-income and vulnerable individuals unfamiliar with navigating government bureaucracy. Tenants found long waits, language and technological barriers, and vague explanations if they were denied assistance, according to lawyers involved in the settlement. The settlement requires the department to make several changes to its system for pending relief applications and </p> to <p>provide tenants with the information they need to appeal.</p><p>More than <a href="https://publiccounsel.org/litigation/acce-v-hcd/" target="_blank">100,000</a> households are waiting to hear whether they will receive rent relief, according to a data analysis by Public Counsel.</p><p>"Ultimately, the petitioners and [the Department of Housing and Community Development] chose to settle the litigation to move the program forward with the shared goal of assisting Californians, department officials said in a</p>n emailed<p> statement to </p> T<p>he </p>Los Angeles<p> Times. We are committed to working with our partners to bring resolution and support to those remaining in the application pipeline.</p><p>The settlement comes as </p> the city of <p>Los Angeles' </p>Citys <p><a href="https://housing.lacity.org/highlights/renter-protections" target="_blank">first rent repayment period ends on Aug. 1</a>  the deadline for tenants to pay rental debt accumulated between March 2020 and September 2021.</p><p>According to the complaint, tenants often received rent relief denials that amounted to a few words, such as nonresponsive, inconsistent</p>,<p> or unverifiable information. Without more detailed explanations, tenants werent sure why they were denied or how to appeal successfully, the advocates suing the state said.</p><p>Applicants who did not speak English received little assistance, while others were denied for a single missing document from the long list of papers required for verification, Malik said. Many tenants do not have formal leases, she added, which also caused denials.</p><p>Low-income older adults who are not used to dealing with online technology similarly found the application process insurmountably difficult, said Cynthia Strathmann, executive director of Strategic Actions for a Just Economy, one of the organizations that sued the state. These individuals often didnt have emails or laptops, struggled to remember their passwords and didnt know how to log in to their portals.</p><p>The housing department's call center provided little, if any, help, Malik said: Tenants would call dozens of times, and nobody would answer. People who did answer did not always have authority to enter the portal.</p><p>Whats more, many tenants were evicted after they applied for funding but before they received it, said Madeline Howard, </p> s<p>enior </p> a<p>ttorney at Western Center on Law &amp; Poverty, one of the law groups that helped file</p>d<p> the lawsuit. The state had no mechanism to track people who were evicted while awaiting assistance, Howard added.</p><p>Valeria De La Luz said she accumulated over $30,000 in rent debt during the pandemic. The Los Angeles resident, who </p>only <p>speaks </p> only <p>Spanish, applied for rental assistance in November 2021. She was approved, she said, but the next day the decision switched to a denial due to insufficient evidence that she qualified. De La Luz submitted an appeal in March 2022, but has yet to hear from the housing department.</p><p>I dont feel safe at home, De La Luz said in an interview with </p> T<p>he </p>LA <p>Times.</p><p>On top of mounting debt and debacles with her landlord, De La Luz said she lost her job due to the pandemic and has been diagnosed with several health issues. She says she hesitates to receive the surgery she needs because she has no safe place to recover.</p><p>I do have some peace and quiet</p> .<p> I feel a little bit of a relief, but I am not calling this a win because I still have not gotten the funds that I was promised, De La Luz said. I know that Im not the only one.</p><p>Landlords, especially those who manage</p>d<p> small properties and are eligible for the relief, are also celebrating the settlement after losing several years of rental income during the pandemic. Debra Carlton, </p> e<p>xecutive </p> v<p>ice </p> p<p>resident of the California Apartment Ass</p>ociatio<p>n</p> .<p>, said she still expects some landlord applicants will receive denials. </p><p>It's been much harder on the smaller owners who can't balance it out with other tenants, she said. </p><p><b>The </b></p> <b>s</b><p><b>ettlement</b></p><p>Tenants who applied for the rental aid before the end of March 2022 and were denied by June 7 of that year or who have pending applications should expect to receive an update about their applications in the coming months, according to a </p>press  news <p>release</p> from June 5<p>.</p> <p><a href="https://publiccounsel.org/ca-rent-relief/">For many tenants</a>, </p> t<p>he housing department is required to issue new, more detailed denial notices. Applicants who are denied assistance will have 30 days to appeal.</p><p>Additionally, the settlement requires the state agency to make the appeals process easier, fix language barriers, and conduct an audit of denials from March to May 2022 due to "non-responsiveness." The department is also required under the legal agreement to fund local, community-based programs to help tenants navigate the appeals process.</p><p>Howard said that plaintiff lawyers and their clients will meet with the housing department every two weeks for three months, and then monthly to ensure that there is open communication in case problems arise.</p><p>In a February court filing, the housing department said it had some $300 million in state and federal funds left to administer.</p><p>Despite the settlement, rent debt left over from the pandemic will remain a source of stress, eviction</p>,<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-28/rising-homelessness-in-the-latino-community">and homelessness</a>, Malik said, as renters have still been accruing debt after the application portal closed in March 2022.</p><p>This settlement doesn't mean that this issue is gone, she said.</p>For <p>Tenants and landlords with pending applications</p>, you<p> can access Public Counsel's FAQ at <a href="https://publiccounsel.org/ca-rent-relief/" target="_blank">www.carentrelief.org</a> or call Housing </p> I<p>s Key's call center at </p> (<p>833</p> )<p> 343-2122.

After his rent surged past $1,000 a month in early 2021 he feared he would have to move out  until he got a $7,300 lifeline from the federal <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-06-09/state-reaches-settlement-over-pandemic-rent-relief-what-tenants-and-landords-need-to-know">Emergency Rental Assistance Program</a>.</p><p>That kept him in his apartment and even helped him build a small nest egg. Now graduated and working full time, hes a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-03-29/buying-a-socal-house-the-great-home-hunt-guide">first-time home buyer</a>.</p><p>Bautista is one of millions of renters who benefited from temporary programs put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on evictions, income support  and the rental assistance program. One of the most ambitious investments in emergency housing in the nations history, it has disbursed $46 billion in aid to state and local governments since early 2021 and kept millions of people in their homes, according to an analysis of government data by Bloomberg News.</p><p>With rents still climbing and the economy at risk of a recession, housing advocates are urging the Biden administration to keep helping tenants. That will be hard under legislation signed into law last weekend that suspended the nations borrowing limit as it clawed back unused pandemic aid and imposed caps on future increases in the federal budget.</p><p>We are facing an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet Republican lawmakers are insisting on slashing funding for and jeopardizing the future of critical housing affordability programs that support working families, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said in a statement.</p> State reaches settlement over pandemic rent relief: What tenants and landlords need to know <p>Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau show that, on average, 48.46 million people reported being caught up on their rent during the first quarter of this year, 4.7 million more than before the Emergency Rental Assistance Program was put in place as the economy was reeling from shutdowns. Even though the estimated number of renters in the country increased during the period, the number of people behind on their rent fell.</p><p>These policies drove eviction filing rates to historic lows," </p>according to <p>a <a href="https://evictionlab.org/covid-era-policies-cut-eviction-filings-by-more-than-half/">report</a> from the Eviction Lab </p> stated<p>. Eviction filings were cut by more than half </p> inof<p> 31 cities they sampled, largely due to COVID-era policies, according to the lab, a housing research group at Princeton University.</p><p>Nevertheless, Republicans have shown little appetite for continuing pandemic-era programs, including for rent assistance, as they seek to reduce the federal budget deficit.</p><p>Progressives attempts to make crisis programs permanent, even after an emergency ends, is just another example of Democrats spending taxpayer money we dont have, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a key negotiator on the debt limit bill, said in a statement. Now its time to end this program.</p><p>The Treasury Department let states, counties and cities use the emergency rent aid in one of three ways: on direct assistance to households, housing stability measures and administrative expenses. About $33 billion of the $46 billion was used for direct assistance to more than 7 million households, according to a Bloomberg evaluation of Treasury data.</p> L.A. County supervisors propose adopting permanent rental protections<p>States, on average, sent 70% of their used funds directly to tenants and landlords, and those that spent most of the money for direct assistance tended to help more tenants get up to date on their rent  suggesting the program was having the desired effect. California, for example, used more than 75% of the $5.6 billion allocated to it from the rental assistance program for direct aid to tenants and landlords. The result: an average of 986,000 more renters were caught up on rent than before the program was established. New York saw about 440,000 residents catch up, or almost 10% of the tenants in the state.</p><p>North Dakota spent less on rental payments and it is one of four states  Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia are the others  that saw the number of tenants behind on rent grow.</p><p>Direct assistance was limited to renters with an income below 80% of the areas median income and who were able to demonstrate that they were at risk of homelessness and </p>and<p> were suffering a financial hardship because of the pandemic.</p><p>Bautista, the former University of Texas student, met the eligibility </p> requirements<p>. He now works as a management assistant for a low-income housing coalition. On the side, he doles out affordable housing advice to college students and recent grads.</p><p>Im not supposed to be where I am today, he said. This program changed my life.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>The Treasury Department and state governments were criticized&nbsp;for dispersing money too slowly at the programs onset. Some states even had their funding reallocated.</p><p>The Treasury said it tracked some information</p> ,<p> like the number of dollars distributed, the number of households served</p>,<p> and the demographics of its applicants. However, program administrators said they didn't have the bandwidth to measure or poll whether recipients were able to catch up on rent while it was dispersing funds.</p><p>We faced a race with time. Experts were projecting a tsunami of evictions if we did not get the emergency rental payments flowing before the eviction moratorium ended, Gene Sperling, a senior White House advisor and coordinator of the Biden administrations American Rescue Plan, said in a statement. The fact that we actually saw eviction rates go below historic averages was proof we did get payments out in time.</p><p>Data on evictions is hard to come by, said Peter Hepburn, associate director of the Eviction Lab. There are more than 3,000 independently operated county courts that handle evictions, many of which often keep documents sealed, undigitized or both.</p><p>The lab credits the pandemic measures for preventing at least 800,000 evictions in 31 U.S. metropolitan areas it studied.</p><p>The rental assistance program itself has been a godsend and a blessing for everyone who has been able to use those funds to remain housed, said Mark Fessler, deputy director of litigation and training at the nonprofit South Carolina Legal Services.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But even when she gets a few hours of overtime at the theme park, the single mother of four can barely afford the rent of her one-bedroom apartment in Panorama City.</p><p>On her salary, buying a home is out of the question.</p><p>Already, her monthly rent of $1,300 is "just too expensive at this point," Arceo said, with late fees of $40 to $50 compounding her financial plight. "I don't think I've ever been on time on my rent." </p><p>Arceo's situation is common in California, which is among the nation's leaders in renter-occupied housing</p> units<p>. In the Golden State, 45.5% of housing units were occupied by renters in 2020, a small increase from the 44% rate </p>of renters<p> in 2010, according to newly released data by the U.S. Census </p> Bureau<p>. </p><p>California was second only to New York, where 49.7% of the housing units are renter occupied. The District of Columbia was an outlier, at 61.7%. </p><p>Nationwide, the rate of renter-occupied housing units  36.9%  is at its highest point since 1970.</p><p> "The growth of renter-occupied units continues to outpace the growth of owner-occupied units," the Census Bureau said in a statement.</p><p>The states with the lowest renter rate  and therefore the highest owner-occupied rates  were West Virginia, at 27.4%, and Maine, at 28.9%.</p><p>Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California, said the new data were </p>was <p>"not shocking." California's high rate of renters can be attributed mostly to "the high cost of housing," Johnson said.</p><p>The annual income needed to buy a home in Los Angeles rose last year </p>to <p>beyond $220,000, according to a study by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-01/you-need-earn-more-than-220000-year-buy-house-in-los-angeles">the residential real estate firm Redfin</a>. With higher mortgage interest rates and inflation cutting into household incomes, the ability to own a home is increasingly </p>beyond  out of<p> reach for </p>more <p>residents in Los Angeles, where the median annual household income in 2020 was just over $65,000.</p><p>High housing costs are also a factor in putting California near the bottom in another category: the rate of single-occupancy households.</p><p>New data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2020-census-demographic-profile-and-dhc.html">Census Bureau</a> show that more than a quarter of all households in America  27.6%  had just one occupant in 2020. The rate of solo occupancy is more than three times the recorded level in 1940, 7.7%.</p><p>A Times analysis found that California ranked 49th of the 50 states in the rate of single-occupant dwellings, with 23% of households occupied by just one person  a rate that has remained steady for about 20 years. Only Utah had a lower rate, at 20%.</p><p>North Dakota had the highest rate of single occupancy, 32.8%. The District of Columbia's rate was an astronomical 43.7%.</p><p>In states </p>outside  other than <p>California, "where rents are much lower or the opportunity to buy a house is better, it's not as difficult for a single worker" to live alone, Johnson said.</p><p>Another factor is California having a "larger immigrant population than in the rest of the U.S.," according to Johnson. "It is more common for immigrant families to live in multigenerational households," he said.</p><p>Utah has the lowest rate of single-occupant homes because the state has a high marriage rate and an uncommonly high number of children per household, Johnson said. He attributed those trends partially to Mormon residents, who make up well over half of the state's population.</p><p>The increase in people living alone coincides with higher social isolation, a worrying trend outlined by U.S. Surgeon Gen. Dr. Vivek Murthy in a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html">recent report</a>.</p><p>Our epidemic of loneliness and isolation has been an underappreciated public health crisis that has harmed individual and societal health. Our relationships are a source of healing and well-being hiding in plain sight  one that can help us live healthier, more fulfilled and more productive lives,&nbsp;Murthy said.</p><p>Such isolation increases the risk of premature death by more than 60% and includes higher risks of heart disease, stroke and dementia, according to the report.</p><p>To counter the increased isolation, "communities must design environments that promote connection," the report said, and "invest in institutions that bring people together."</p><p>While more Americans are living alone, Arceo, 32, worries about providing her children a home where they can enjoy some space for themselves.</p><p>With a 14-year-old son in the throes of adolescence and a 12-year-old son entering that stage, "they need their privacy," she said.</p><p>"It's insane to say that I work for this company and can't afford to give my kids a proper living," Arceo said.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/8e/4e/0c89fd614ee4a79b2e3a3b347c41/1304825-me-overcrowding-story-04-mjc-2.JPG"></figure><p>She has worked as a baker for the theme park for eight years, but Arceo notes that "I was homeless for the first year working at Universal," when she was forced to live with her then-three children in hotels, friends' homes, wherever they could.</p><p>With the bakery short-staffed, she has recently picked up "at least an hour of overtime a day," but it hasn't been enough, forcing her "to choose whether I pay my car insurance or my rent," she said.</p><p>Johnson, the demographer, pointed to possible hope on the horizon. He noted that California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-25/california-census-data">has reported a steady decline in population</a> since 2020  starting at the beginning of the pandemic. The drop has coincided with the construction of more housing, primarily in the state's suburbs and exurbs.</p><p>"If California continues to lose people and build housing, at some point it should make a dent in the housing deficit."</p><p>A construction surge is not likely to make enough of a difference to change the conditions for low-wage workers like Arceo.</p><p>Looking to the future, she doesn't see many options. </p><p>"I can't afford to move," she said. </p>"The conditions of the apartment are not good at all," with mold from January's rains still not removed despite repeated complaints to her landlord.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It also reminded Adams that he had pledged in court documents never to evict a tenant for overdue rent only.</p><p>The citys letter tells Adams that he </p>needs  has 48 hours<p> to provide a written accounting of how many notices went out and who authorized them</p> within 48 hours<p>.</p><p>In an email to The Times, Adams said that the notices were a mistake and sent without his approval. He said he<b> </b>distributed <a href="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/17/51/b1cd45ec4f93bf252fa37f05fa3a/receiver-adams-letter-to-skid-row-housing-trust-tenants-6-5-23.pdf" target="_blank">a letter rescinding them</a> to all 1,500 Skid Row Housing Trust tenants on Monday.</p><p>Solely because of failure to pay rent, I will not seek to evict anyone, Adams said in the letter.</p><p>Adams said he didnt know how many tenants had received the eviction notices, and that any further similar action taken by Beach Front Property Management</p>, the firm Adams hired,<p> would be grounds for its termination. A spokesperson for the firm referred comment to the receiver.</p><p>The eviction notices are the latest example of concerns about Adams performance from city officials and the trusts tenants.</p><p>Two residents of the Boyd Hotel who received eviction notices told The Times that conditions there had changed little, and in some ways grown worse, in the two months of the receivership.</p><p>Only one of the four bathrooms on their floor works reliably, they said. A second is in and out of service, and the maintenance crew has locked the other two, they said. Their case managers have been laid off, and people from the street continue to enter the building at all hours to use the bathrooms, sleep, use drugs or buy contraband.</p><p>This spring, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-30/la-receivership-skid-row-housing-trust-buildings">the city pushed for Adams to be put in charge</a> of the properties after the nonprofit housing provider had largely abandoned them in squalid conditions. Many tenants are elderly, disabled or suffering from mental health and drug problems.</p><p>Under a receivership, Adams would have the authority to borrow money to pay for repairs and upgrades to the trusts residential hotels and other low-income apartment complexes, putting them on solid financial footing  ultimately to allow other affordable housing providers to take over.</p><p>Feldstein Soto has said that the trusts rapid disintegration required the city to turn to Adams, who has handled 300 receiverships over more than two decades, as the only one who could handle the situation despite not fully vetting his resume beforehand.</p><p>A Times review of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-05-17/skid-row-housing-trust-mark-adams-receiver">Adams record published last month</a> found that in some cases, tenants faced the risk of eviction, property owners lost their houses and multiple judges determined he inflated his fees by six-figure amounts. Additionally, in two cases comparable in size and scope to the trust matter, Adams left years before they were resolved and, in court filings, omitted key facts about his involvement in them.</p><p>Feldstein Soto continued to maintain that the situations urgency pointed toward Adams as uniquely qualified to address it. But she said shes been unimpressed by Adams performance.</p><p>A $1.3</p> -<p>million loan Adams has received came with a 15% interest rate, violating an agreement the city had with the receiver not to exceed 10% interest when borrowing money, a deputy city attorney<b> </b>said at a court hearing last month. Feldstein Soto said </p>that <p>the city also has been spot checking trust properties and found that there isnt always management and security on site, contrary to Adams assertions.</p><p>We believed that this receiver had both the liquidity and the experience and expertise to quickly get on top of and manage the situation, Feldstein Soto said. I think it's fair to say we've been disappointed.</p><p>In court, an attorney representing Adams said that lenders required the higher interest rate after investors in some of the trust's better properties expressed a desire to remove them from the receivership, making the deal more risky for them. Through a spokesperson, Adams said that there is 24/7 security at every site and that he never pledged to have round-the-clock management.</p><p>The two tenants at the Boyd, a 112-year-old residential hotel with 61 units, said theyve been withholding</p> their<p> rent because they have long</p> -<p>standing legal claims against Skid Row Housing Trust over conditions at the building.</p><p>Maintenance crews, they said, are beginning to repair or replace clogged sinks in individual rooms but that drains are still chronically backed up and mold is growing in showers in shared bathrooms on each floor. Some people, they said, block the drains intentionally to use the showers for laundry.</p><p>The two male residents spoke to </p> T<p>he Times anonymously, one to respect his 12-step program and the other out of concern his job would be jeopardized.</p><p>They said the receiver has staffed the building with guards from three </p>different <p>security firms, but they have not stopped non-residents from entering the hotel at all hours to use the bathrooms, sleep, do drugs or buy contraband.</p><p>There's been people that have been living there that are not on a lease or not attached to anybody, one said.</p><p>At first the guards were throwing the interlopers out but then stopped, they said.</p><p>One man said a homeless person who had struck him with a steel baton several months ago has returned after his release from jail.</p><p>They said that a tenant on their floor runs a store out of his unit selling cigarettes, beer and liquor, and street people come to his door at all hours.</p><p>One of the residents emailed The Times a photo Tuesday of trash and feces in a hallway that he said was left by a non-tenant.</p><p>The men suspected the eviction notices were a ploy to get them to leave their apartments because they were complaining about the Boyds conditions.</p><p>I think they want to empty the building and start over with brand new people, one said.</p><p>Joseph Woods, an attorney representing the two residents and co-counsel in a habitability lawsuit filed on behalf of tenants in two other Skid Row Housing Trust buildings, said he has seen some small but important steps taken by the receiver.</p><p>We are pleased to see that elevators are being kept in good repair and functional order, which was not true in the past, Woods said.</p><p>Woods said that the receivership has added security, but it remains inadequate.</p><p>Feldstein Soto, Mayor Karen Bass and other city leaders have said their primary goal has been to prevent mass evictions of the trusts tenants, a potential<b> </b>catastrophe that could add hundreds to Skid Rows already overwhelming homeless population.</p><p>"This was an absolutely egregious mistake," Bass said of the eviction notices in a statement. "I support the city attorneys investigation into this incident and steps she is taking to ensure that the rights of all tenants of Skid Row Housing Trust properties are protected and secured."</p><p>City Councilmember Kevin de Len, who represents Skid Row, said that Feldstein Soto and Adams have cut the council out of decisions about the receivership. The eviction notices, he said, provide another example of the need for the council to exercise greater oversight.</p><p>Its not a good first step to introduce yourself to the city by erroneously or mistakenly issuing out eviction notices, sending a panic into already very vulnerable residents, said De Len, who authored a council motion calling for more regular updates on the receivers activities </p>following  after<p> last months Times story on Adams background. When it comes to the receiver and the city attorney, its on both of them. They gotta own it.</p><p>De Len also said hes deeply concerned about the receiverships effects on the citys finances, especially given prior cases </p>where in which<p> judges have cited Adams for overbilling.</p><p>Normally, receiverships pay for repairs and the receivers fees by tapping properties equity or through proceeds from a property sale. But with the trust on the brink of insolvency and federal and local restrictions preventing tenants rents from ballooning, city housing officials have acknowledged the city treasury likely will be on the hook for at least some of the still-unknown cost</p> s<p>.</p><p>Adams has assigned 18 employees, including himself, to the trust matter with hourly rates </p>ranging <p>from $151 to $465. An accounting filed by Adams in court lists $187,000 in expenses and advances incurred by his firm in April. Additionally, Adams has received authority from the court to borrow up to $5.3 million to finance repairs.</p><p>I dont think the majority of the council </p> m<p>embers are aware that the citys budget is an ATM machine that will be strictly controlled by a judge and a receiver, De Len said.</p><p>Feldstein Soto said that her office was leading an investigation into Adams performance and expects to reveal its results </p> before prior to <p>the next court hearing in the case scheduled for June 15. She declined to describe what the investigation entailed but didnt rule out that she might recommend Adams be replaced.</p><p>We, at this point, have to consider all kinds of possibilities, Feldstein Soto said.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"El Nio winters also bring better chances for warmer-than-average temperatures across the northern tier of the country."</p><p>But human-caused climate change can exacerbate or mitigate some of its </p> effects,impacts, <p>L'Heureux said, including setting <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hottest-year-2016-20170118-story.html">new records for temperatures</a>.</p><p>Eric Boldt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, said it</p> '<p>s not a coincidence that the </p>e<p>Earth's warmest year on record, 2016, was an El Nio year. </p><p>"There's a lot of talk that this coming year could be one of the warmest on record," Boldt said. </p><p>The <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/global-temperatures-set-reach-new-records-next-five-years" target="_blank">World Meteorological Organization recently predicted</a> there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years  and the five-year period as a whole  will be the warmest on record.</p><p>In Southern California, just about any category of El Nio  weak, moderate</p>,<p> or strong  can bring above-normal precipitation in Southern California, Boldt said, meaning there is potential for two back-to-back wet years following this year's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-03/california-snowpack-is-the-deepest-its-ever-been">unexpectedly soggy winter</a>.</p><p>However, he added that it is not a guarantee.</p><p>"Any time we talk about El Nio, historically, rainfall totals in Southern California have been above normal in most cases  but not all," Boldt said. </p><p>He noted that the 2015-</p>20<p>16 El Nio was one of the strongest on record, but failed to deliver significant rain, flooding and other anticipated effects in Southern California, ultimately dropping only about 6 inches of rain.</p><p>But El Nio can also have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-19/return-of-el-nino-would-have-far-reaching-impacts">knock-on effects</a> in California and across the world, including economic and agricultural </p> effects. impacts.<p>A <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2983" target="_blank">study published last month</a> found that the 1982-83 El Nio contributed to an estimated $4.1 trillion in global income losses in the five years that followed, and the 1997-98 El Nio contributed to an estimated $5.7 trillion in losses.</p><p>Median losses from the incoming event could be at least $3 trillion by 2029, the study found.</p><p>Warmer winter temperatures can also affect crops in California and other agricultural regions, particularly crops that require a higher chill during winter dormancy, such as pistachios, cherries and pears. </p><p>Earlier bud-breaks and flowering, longer growing seasons and more pressure from agricultural pests are also possible, researcher</p> s<p> said. </p><p>UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain noted that El Nio may already be exerting some influence on global circulation patterns, but it is also arriving amid some anomalous conditions such as an enhanced subtropical jet stream and <a href="https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/" target="_blank">record-breaking oceanic warmth</a>.</p><p>"So in some ways this year is a year with no reasonable historical analogues," Swain wrote in his blog, <a href="https://weatherwest.com/" target="_blank">Weather West</a>. </p><p>"Were hurtling toward a potentially strong El Nio event following a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-13/la-nina-california-rare-third-year">rare triple-dip La Nia</a> event amid a period of record oceanic warmth driven by climate change," Swain said. "It's a combination we havent really seen before in the modern era, and its a bit difficult to say what it might mean in the months to come."</p><p>He added that it is "fair to say there is even more uncertainty than usual regarding how the next 6 months or so will unfold" from a regional and even global climate perspective.</p><p>The outlook arrives as Southern California continues to experience a stretch of cool and cloudy weather in contrast to nearly everywhere else in the world, where recent months have leaned unusually warm. </p><p>The latest <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/lead14/" target="_blank">monthly outlook from the NOAA</a> indicates that below-normal temperatures will persist in Southern California and much of the Southwest through the end of the month. </p><p>But while Los Angeles <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-07/how-long-is-june-gloom-supposed-to-last-southern-california-can-expect-cooler-temperatures-cloudy-skies">remains shrouded in June gloom</a>, wildfires in </p>Western <p>Canada have blanketed that region  and much of the</p> east cost East Coast<p>  in thick smoke, producing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-08/unhealthy-air-smoke-continues-to-cover-large-swaths-of-u-s-for-third-straight-day">some of the worst air quality on Earth</a>.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

A look at 2023's new bills<p>Here are two </p> bills<p> to help renters </p> that cleared a major hurdle <p>and one proposal that flopped this week as the Legislature took action</p> <p>before a key deadline on Friday: </p>Passed: Limiting security deposits <p>The </p>California<p> Assembly easily approved a bill to ban landlords from charging more than one month's rent as a security deposit. </p><p>Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat who authored <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB12" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 12</a>, said that surging rent </p>prices have<p> has made it increasingly difficult for renters to pay security deposits, which can equal up to three months worth of rent, or more than $10,000 in some cities. </p> Newsom says the state is on track to cut unsheltered homelessness by 15% <p>"This means a security deposit can be as much as a down payment on a house in many parts of the country," Haney said before the Assembly approved the measure. "This pushes many families, including those with individuals making minimum wage, to either forgo necessities such as food and utilities or acquire more debt in order to be approved for housing." </p><p>Groups representing landlords opposed the measure, arguing that the lack of affordable housing units, not security deposits, </p>are<p> is the real issue facing California renters, and that AB 12 would harm homeowners. </p><p>"Charging security deposits allows for rental property providers to balance risk associated with renting out property," the California Rental Housing Assn. wrote in a bill analysis.</p> <p>"Without the ability to collect enough in security deposit to cover potential damages, rental property providers may decide to remove their homes from the rental market  further exacerbating the housing supply crisis." </p><p>The bill will now be considered by the Senate, which has until Sept. 14 to vote on it. </p> L.A. County's eviction moratorium has expired. What does that mean for renters?Passed: Curbing evictions<p>In 2019, the Legislature hashed out a deal with landlords and realtors on a bill to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-11/california-renters-relief-legislation-gavin-newsom-rent-cap">establish new rules against evictions and cap yearly rent increases to 5% plus inflation</a>. </p><p>But state Sen. Mara Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) said those protections didn't go far enough. Durazo introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB567" target="_blank">Senate Bill 567</a> this year to lower the rent cap to inflation, not to exceed 5% annually, and strengthen oversight of allowable evictions to ensure landlords aren't exploiting what she described as loopholes in the law. </p><p>Facing pressure from business groups, apartment associations and moderate Democrats, Durazo later removed the rent cap provision of the bill. But advocates pushed hard to keep in accountability measures that would ensure landlords are not using evictions to remove a lower-paying tenant to later jack up the rent. </p><p>"We are all feeling the impact of the homeless crisis in our districts," Durazo said during a Wednesday debate over the bill.

Corona showed me a collection of murals inside the courtyard with Black and Latino motifs: monarch butterflies, ankhs, Aztec gods, and an ibis in red, black and green, the<b> </b>colors of the Pan-African flag. </p><p>But off to the side was another mural with a starker message.</p><p>It honored the Black-owned California Eagle and its publisher, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-02-22-me-342-story.html">Charlotta Bass</a>. Her weekly newspaper, a caption noted, was a trumpet for the people [that] denounced inequality and injustices. Next to those words is an illustration of two young Mexican American men on the ground, victims of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-zoot-suit-riots-anniversary-20180604-story.html">Zoot Suit riots</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9e/4a/b13440c84ecf83371800abdbd324/youth-stripped-another-beaten.JPEG"></figure><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-17/los-angeles-county-denounces-dark-chapter-of-zoot-suit-riots-80-years-later">As L.A. observes the 80th anniversary of the unrest</a>, which largely unfolded from June 3 to June 8</p> ,1943,<p> much will be said about wartime xenophobia and bigotry. How thousands of white servicemen and civilians assaulted anyone who wore the flamboyant zoot suits  Black</p>s<p>, white</p>s<p>, Filipino</p>s<p>, but especially Mexican American</p>s<p>.</p><p>Less known is the story told in the </p>Charlotta<p> Bass mural.</p><p>On June 10, 1943, the Eagle's front-page headline screamed Zoot Riot Jolts Watts. Next to it a photo showed a young Black man with a bloodied lip. Dispatches from across the city painted the ugliness of a week of mayhem. </p><p>In an open letter to Mayor Fletcher Bowron, Bass decried the riots as a white heat of lynch fury and blamed the citys dailies  including this paper  for kindling hatred over the previous year. Nothing in my experience, she wrote, has been so vicious, deliberate, or disruptive as the campaign of our city's metropolitan papers against" Mexican Americans.</p><p>The Eagles anger extended to its ads  the reason why I came to the Central Avenue Farmers Market.</p><p>The back page of the Eagle's June 10 edition featured a full-page spread for the Peoples Victory Market, a grocery co-op started by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-dec-24-op-4133-story.html">Rev. Clayton D. Russell</a>, one of the most prominent preachers in Black L.A. at the time. </p><p>Russells ad urged Black Angelenos to stand with Mexicans, who</p>m<p> it said had been "shamefully attacked" by the press and police for far too long. </p><p>Because we in the Negro community are more unified and have greater political power, it read, we must lead in the demand for FULL POLICE PROTECTION OF THE MEXICAN COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES.</p>CAPS IN ORIGINAL<p> ... We must say to our great United Nations neighbor, Mexico  SALUDOS AMIGOS! And, by Heaven, we must MEAN IT!"</p><p>The Black community responded  and not just locally.&nbsp;</p><p>Coverage of the riots appeared in the most prominent Black newspapers in the country, the Chicago Defender and Pittsburgh Courier. Legendary poet Langston Hughes used his Defender column to describe Los Angeles as a city where Mexicans were shoved around like Negroes.</p><p>NAACP head Walter White said zoot suiters were "almost invariably the victims of poverty, proscription and segregation." In the organization's magazine, the Crisis, Chester </p>B. <p>Himes ridiculed rioting servicemen as Nazi storm troopers and Klan members, while attacking the white supremacy in Los Angeles that made the riots possible.</p><p>What could make the white people more happy than to see their uniformed sons sapping up some dark-skinned people? wrote Himes. Los Angeles was at last being made safe for white people  to do as they damned well pleased.</p><p>Back home, Dorsey Highs NAACP junior council passed a resolution urging unity with Mexican youth after their principal told students during an assembly that I don't want any of that low zoot suit stuff from the Eastside on this campus! </p><p>The Mexican Youth Defense Committee and the junior council of the L.A. NAACP chapter created a coalition. Black, Mexican American, white and Jewish activists formed the Committee for American Unity to sponsor programs which will make race riots a thing of the past and that exploitation of minority groups will be erased from the community, according to the Eastside Journal.</p><p>The leaders of the Black community really seemed to understand that they weren't safe just because they weren't the primary target, said Kevin Leonard, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. He was among the first scholars to examine the Black communitys response to the riots. They connected it to Black experiences in the South. As long as people were allowed to be scapegoated or turned into victims of violence, then no one was safe.</p><p>That unity, however, is almost completely ignored in the popular memory of the Zoot Suit </p> r<p>iots.</p><p>It's nonexistent in the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-06-07/the-zoot-suit-riots-cruise-hopes-to-remember-a-forgotten-era">lowrider cruises</a>, galas, street festivals and social media posts that portray the violence as a modern-day pogrom against Mexican Americans. Whats emphasized instead is pachuco cool, Chicano style, Mexican resilience. If theres mention of the Black men who originated zoot suits and also suffered and fought back during the riots, its rarely more than a shout-out.</p><p>This history has become so erased that when Luis Alvarez published a history of the zoot suit in 2008, Chicano studies professors he knew threw a lot of static at the book's cover, which showed well-dressed Jamaican immigrants in </p>Great<p> Britain.</p><p>They asked me, Why would Black people be on the cover of a book about the Zoot Suit Riots? </p>"<p> said the UC San Diego history professor. Theres just an obscurity to this history that needs to be unraveled.</p><p>The unity of two long-neglected communities during trying times is a reminder of what we desperately need in Los Angeles, especially in the wake of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-21/la-city-council-racist-audio-leak-transcription-annotation">last fall's L.A.

But the mobs went after Black men as well.</p><p>The NAACP field office logged dozens of incidents: Joseph Nelson, 16, got dragged out of a car </p>on<p> at </p>Fifth<p> 5th and Main streets and had his pants cut. Louis Jackson, 23, a shipyard worker, had an eye gouged out after being jumped at </p>Third<p> 3rd Street and Santa Fe Avenue. Two Black teenagers wearing zoot suits had to seek refuge at the Pasadena police station from marauders. </p><p>The riots reached their climax the night of June 7, as an estimated 5,000 civilians swarmed into downtown Los Angeles. Servicemen barged into movie theaters and stripped off the zoot suits of anyone wearing them. At </p>the intersection of<p> 12th Street and Central Avenue, rioters forced two teens to take off their offending clothes and burned the suits in front of them.</p><p>South L.A. was next.</p><p>Loren Miller, </p>editor<p> a former Eagle editor who wrote at the time for another Black-owned newspaper, the Los Angeles Sentinel, called Mayor Bowron and let him know any push south wouldnt end well for the sailors.</p><p>We were going to raise hell and see that anybody that came over in the Negro community looking around for any trouble was going to find plenty of trouble, Miller said in an interview decades later. If anybody came up to 12th and Central, somebody was going to get killed, and I didnt think it was going to be Negroes.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-19-oe-smith19-story.html">Hundreds of pachucos came from the Eastside</a> to help their Black peers. They "loaned us their cars to use, Rudy Leyvas</p>WORTH NOTING HE'S THE BROTHER OF HANK LEYVAS?<p> told the Times in 1978. "[Servicemen] were surprised. It was the first time anybody was organized to fight back. </p><p>The ensuing brawl saw police officers join in. But any advance south stopped for the night.</p><p>Two days later, rioters tried one final invasion of South L.A. when 150 sailors and </p>air corp<p> Air Corps members hitched rides to Watts. Throughout the riots, Black and Mexican zooters had thrown rocks at Pacific Electric Red Cars heading to </p>to<p> the neighborhood packed with servicemen looking for pachucos. After ignoring, if not condoning, the riots, military brass had finally intervened and declared Los Angeles off limits to military personnel. Thinking Watts was its own city, the service members marched through the streets with clubs, pipes and bottles singing military tunes while shouting: Where are the zoot suiters?</p><p>Before anything major happened, military police arrived and ordered the aspiring rioters back to their bases. Civilian police, meanwhile, arrested more than 20 Black and Mexican American teens for continuing to throw rocks at the Red Cars.</p><p>There was an interracial aspect to the resistance from the very beginning, Alvarez said. Black</p>s<p> and Mexican American</p>s Angelenos<p> were going to concerts together. They were traversing pool halls and backyard parties together. They were in relationships. They were supposed to be invisible and silent, and they were seen and heard. </p><p>The public forgot this history, the professor argued, because the Chicano movement rehabilitated</p> <p>the pachuco as an icon and figure of resistance against white supremacy and thus ignored other victims. In the Black community, meanwhile, "the story there is Malcolm Little turning in his zoot for another suit and becoming Malcolm X."</p><p>Alvarez understands why the two narratives emerged and continue. But he stressed that teaching the Zoot Suit Riots as a multicultural affair reminds us about the interconnection between Mexican American history and African American history. Those of us who care about those fields understand that we can't necessarily tell the story of one without the other.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/2d/cd/72cb17d54c7a898a0e4f7b383a8b/gettyimages-85374826.jpg"></figure><p>Outside the Central Avenue Constituent Services Center, there's a display mounted on a street pole that touts the area's history in English and Spanish. I asked L.A. Councilmember Curren Price, who met me the day I went to the farmers market, if the display mentioned the riots.</p><p>He read through it. Nothing. </p>Nada<p>.</p><p>I knew Black folks were sucked into the riots, he said. And I knew that the reason why was because society wanted to attack a group of young men for how they dressed. Yesterday, it was zoot suits; today its long white T-shirts and hoodies. </p><p>Price told me that memory of the riots is stronger among Mexican Americans because Black Angelenos weren't the primary targets. The South L.A. politician nevertheless thinks about the riots every time he visits his headquarters at the service center, though.</p><p>The mural with Charlotta Bass and the injured pachucos stands right outside the doors to his offices.</p><p>Its a constant reminder of the challenges that Black and </p> b<p>rown people faced in our community, he said. </p><p>He knew about the Peoples Victory Market, but not the Eagle ad urging the Black community to stand with Mexican Americans. He beamed when I explained it to him. Theres a track record of good between Blacks and Latinos  yeah, theres been fights, but the record shows that if were working together, we can be victorious.</p><p>That how Corona, the farmers market manager, felt as well.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/3f/17/7a27535649f693be673d03ce6a77/1298112-me-black-history-zoot-suit-riots-89.jpg"></figure><p>The Mexican immigrant was familiar with zoot suits through the films of the Mexican comedian Tin-Tan, who satirized pachuco culture in a series of films in the 1940s and 1950s. But Corona, a native of </p> Mexico's<p> Jalisco </p> state<p>, had never heard of the riots until I told him.&nbsp;He researched them the night before we spoke.</p><p>They [servicemen] used it as an excuse to beat up people who didnt have </p>voto y voz," <p>he said.
