On the Tuesday agenda for the Glendale Unified School District </p> B<p>oard of </p> E<p>ducation was <a href="https://www.gusd.net/cms/lib/CA01000648/Centricity/Domain/6/Resolution%20June%202023%20as%20LGBTQ%20plus%20Pride%20Month.pdf" target="_blank">an item</a> designating June as Pride Month for the LGBTQ+ community, recognizing the month in which the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/gay-rights/the-stonewall-riots" target="_blank">1969 Stonewall uprising began</a>. Local boards and councils vote on ceremonial items like this all the time to recognize various communities in their districts.</p><p>But then the agents of hate <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-06/glendale-braces-for-protests-ahead-of-school-board-vote-to-recognize-lgbtq-pride-month">showed up</a>. Even before the meeting, dozens of people gathered outside to lodge their objection to a vote that they believe supported the rights of LGBTQ+ people. Among the protesters were members of the Proud Boys, a group advocating for white supremacist and anti-government ideologies </p>and  that <p>participated in the Jan. 6</p> , 2021,<p> insurrection. Soon, LGBTQ+ advocates showed up to protest the protesters, and before long the crowd became unruly and violent. Three people were arrested.</p><p>In the end, the Glendale school board voted to support the designation and, in so doing, took a courageous stand against an insidious strain of intolerance that has been creeping into public school districts across the nation.</p><p>Just the week before, a very similar scenario played out in North Hollywood over a school assembly featuring, The Great Big Book of Families at the Saticoy Elementary School. Protesters <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/00000188-7edd-d4b7-a99a-7ffd36e50000-123">carried signs</a> with statements such as, Parental Choice Matters. Ironically, Saticoy parents did have a choice about whether they wanted their kids to attend the assembly. </p><p>That protest didn't scare the Los Angeles Unified school board either. On Tuesday the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-08/l-a-school-officials-double-down-on-lgbtq-support-in-wake-of-protests">board passed</a> a resolution listing upcoming events it will recognize in addition to Pride Month, such as LGBTQ+ History Month in October and Transgender Day of Remembrance on Nov. 20. In addition, the resolution encourages all district schools to incorporate LGBTQ+ curriculum adopted by the state.</p><p>Troublingly, the protests in Glendale and North Hollywood are part of a <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/for-the-first-time-ever-human-rights-campaign-officially-declares-state-of-emergency-for-lgbtq-americans-issues-national-warning-and-guidebook-to-ensure-safety-for-lgbtq-residents-and-travelers" target="_blank">growing political movement </a>nationwide targeting LGBTQ+ communities, trying to silence and erase them, and even often falsely accusing them of crimes. Books that have been banned in districts nationwide, including in California, are often targeted solely because <a href="https://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2023/03/record-book-bans-2022" target="_blank">they include LGBTQ+ characters or topics</a>.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/for-the-first-time-ever-human-rights-campaign-officially-declares-state-of-emergency-for-lgbtq-americans-issues-national-warning-and-guidebook-to-ensure-safety-for-lgbtq-residents-and-travelers" target="_blank">declared a state of emergency </a>for LGBTQ+ people in the U.S. in light of more than 525 state bills in 2023 targeting them. It was the first time in its 43-year history that the civil rights organization made such a declaration. More than 70 of these bills have been signed into law so far this year. </p><p>These targeted campaigns arent just happening in states governed by primarily Republican legislators. At the Temecula Valley Unified School District in Riverside County, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-03/temecula-valley-school-board-rejects-social-studies-curriculum-that-would-have-included-harvey-milk">teachers protested</a> on Tuesday after the school board rejected social studies textbooks and curriculum for elementary students that contained what school board members called morally objectionable material. School board </p> P<p>resident Joseph Komrosky called slain gay rights activist and former San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk a pedophile. Shame on that board for tolerating such hateful statements at a public meeting. </p><p>Too many school districts are giving into the intolerant bullies. Los Angeles and Glendale should be proud that their school boards did not. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

We first met in her Wallingford, Conn., kitchen the day after Christmas in 1987. This was a few years after her son Al, my partner (now husband) of 36 years, first disclosed to her that she had a gay son. She was accepting but drew the line at never wanting to meet a man Al was with. A daughter of Irish-Catholic immigrant parents, she found it too much in the mid-80s to convey approval by welcoming someone like me into her home.</p><p>And yet, six months after Al and I met that summer in San Diego, here I was at her Wallingford kitchen table, sharing a meal of Als favorite scallops. She was aloof, yet not rejecting or mean. Over the next few years, I would discover that meanness was not in her character. She was conflicted, but she was not the kind of person to deflect her moral conflict via hostility toward me or her son. She loved Al too much for such things.</p><p>I never imagined I would have a mother-in-law. Such a thing was inconceivable for a gay male couple in those days. We were busy just trying not to be rejected.</p><p>Yet over time, she and I developed a mutual respect that eventually became a relationship with a son-in-law whom she never expected she could love.</p><p>Six months after our 1987 Christmas meeting, Al was diagnosed with a medical condition that required brain surgery. He came through the surgery beautifully. When Mr. and Mrs. Killen (this was what they asked me to call them) walked into the post-op hospital room after their emergency flight from Connecticut, Al said, without hesitation and in a strong post-anesthesia voice, Dougs in charge.</p><p>Als parents could have protested. They had the legal rights, not me. But they didnt. They loved Al too much for such things.</p><p>On our next trip to Wallingford, they had moved into the family home passed down across generations. Als sister told us they had prepared for our stay by moving the guest rooms double bed into the basement and setting up twin beds instead. Al said simply that this is not how we sleep. We would be fine with going to a hotel or returning the double bed to its previous location. The bed moved; we stayed. The room never changed again.</p><p>I noticed during later visits that Mrs. Killen made sure to stock her refrigerator with my favorite New England soda, birch beer (feel free to look it up). She knew how much I loved her baked macaroni and cheese and made it a tradition to serve it for us in Connecticut. I also became her VCR technician. She relied on me to program her video recorder to tape her beloved UConn womens basketball games. One time she called our home  it was still the landline era  and Al answered. He heard the caller ask, Is Doug home? Al said, Is this you, Mom? To which she replied, Yes, but I need Doug to help me with the VCR.</p><p>She spoke with her actions. Rather than flexing her parental authority by rejecting her sons relationship, she prioritized her love for him. Simple gestures, such as offering food, conveyed her deep well of affection that now included me.</p><p>Before Als father died, the four of us took vacations together. On these trips, Mr. and Mrs. Killen could be free from their grandparent duties and fully enjoy our doting on them. Gathering as two couples, we created our own special memories in San Francisco, Puerto Vallarta, the Grand Canyon, Los Angeles and Als and my home during many dinners with our chosen San Diego family.</p><p>My mother-in-law died on the third day of Pride month this year. I thought it would be a fitting tribute to honor Mrs. Killen and her journey from just accepting me to eventually loving and including me as part of her family. I am proud of her, and proud of Al and myself. Over the past 36 years we each leaned into the love between mother, son and son-in-law.</p><p>Happy Pride to every mother-in-law who has chosen to enrich their life by expanding themselves and spreading their love to someone like me who never expected, and had to learn how, to embrace it.</p>Douglas Braun-Harvey is cofounder of the Harvey Institute, a sexual health author and trainer and a sex therapy supervisor.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Wednesday was by far the nations worst day in recent history for wildfire smoke pollution, with more people exposed to higher levels of soot than any day since 2006, according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MarshallBBurke/status/1666843238270128129">rapid analysis by Stanford University scientists</a>.</p><p>Thats hardly a surprise to people from New York to Minnesota who have been suffering under this acrid, life-threatening pall. And its the type of in-your-face environmental health crisis that Californians know too well, with authorities urging people to stay inside and filter the air they breathe and canceling outdoor activities, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill">large numbers of people</a> almost certainly getting sick or dying. The second-worst smoke day, after all, was in September 2020, when the haze from an explosion of climate-fueled wildfires up and down the West Coast blotted out the sun, shrouding San Francisco in an apocalyptic orange and contributing to <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/09/23/smoke-from-california-fires-may-have-killed-more-than-1000-people/?clearUserState=true">potentially thousands of early deaths</a>.</p><p>The otherworldly veil that has hung over some of the nations most densely populated areas is the latest illustration of the fact that an overheating planet knows no human-made boundaries, and that as much as we try, no one will be spared the impacts. Everyone, after all, has to breathe.</p><p>These wildfire smoke episodes are disasters as serious as hurricanes, floods or heat waves, and come with a steep human toll. Whether in the East or in the West, they are just one tragic example of how climate change is coming for us all in both a slow accretion and sudden, dramatic bursts.</p><p>We often talk about global warming in terms of incremental change, like fractions of degrees over decades. But it also moves quickly, through the amplification of extreme events such as California's recent spate of record-breaking wildfires, the deadly 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome that pushed temperatures in Portland, Ore., to an unthinkable 116 degrees </p>Fahrenheit <p>and the torrential rain of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 that <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/digest/hurricane-harvey-climate-change-double-flooding-homes">flooded tens of thousands of homes</a> </p> in Texas and Louisiana. <p>Now we add to this horrible list the Manhattan skyline enveloped in a</p> <p> sickly sepia smog that looks </p>like  as if<p> it floated out of the dystopian world of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCcx85zbxz4">Blade Runner 2049</a>."</p><p>These smoke-filled vistas should be front of mind when we talk about the climate crisis, because they send a clear signal that it's a health crisis too.</p><p>And unfortunately, many Americans can expect more smoky days like these in their future. Much like heat waves, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/smoke-waves-will-affect-millions/">smoke waves,</a> a term researchers coined several years ago to describe consecutive days of unhealthy air quality from wildfires, are expected to grow more frequent, long-lasting and intense over the next few decades. Growing numbers of people will have to contend with unhealthy levels of smoke, a particularly nasty type of pollution that lodges deep in the lungs and can enter the bloodstream to worsen asthma, lung and heart disease and cut lives short.</p><p>The increase in smoke pollution, driven by bigger, more intense fires fueled by human-caused global warming, has already been <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30882">eroding hard-won improvements</a> in the nations air quality from decades of emissions-cutting regulations. And even people living hundreds of miles from a wildfire can pay a grave health toll. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/20/wildfire-smoke-deaths-eastern-us/">One 2021 study found</a> that about three-quarters of the wildfire smoke-related asthma emergency room visits and deaths in recent years occurred east of the Rocky Mountains, due to the regions higher population density.</p><p>We have a chance to reduce this suffering, and prevent an even worse lung-choking reality for future generations. But only if we use this as an inflection point to get serious about slashing climate pollution and putting an end to the extraction and burning of fossil fuels. Lets not wait until the smoke clears to start. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Good luck with that.</p><p>This week the Republican field for the presidency took near-final form, and it became clear that among Donald Trumps suddenly expanded number of rivals, some are modeling themselves to varying degrees on that other former president, Ronald Reagan. That strategy is a way of breaking, if only implicitly, with Trump and Trumpism: going back to the future by invoking the most </p>impactful and<p> beloved of modern </p>Republican<p> presidents </p> among Republicans.<p>Of all the announced candidates, none is more overt about embracing Reagan over Trump than Trumps once-obsequious vice president, Mike Pence. At 64, Pence is among the older Trump challengers in the bunch, old enough for Reagan to have been a formative influence for him in real time  as Pence recounted in his presidential announcement in Iowa on Wednesday.</p><p>He started in politics as a Democrat, Pence <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0oc6tdrPas">told his assembled supporters.</a> But Ive got to tell ya  as soon as I heard the voice of the 40th president of the United States, I joined the Reagan revolution and never looked back.</p><p>He punched those final words for emphasis. Yet even in his friendly audience, the applause was merely polite.</p><p>Thats a telling response. It suggests the very real limits of donning the Reagan mantle, whether for Pence, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley, or this weeks other two new entrants in</p>to<p> the contest, former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and second-term North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.</p><p>Reagan, the self-styled optimist who expanded the Republican Partys appeal even as he turned it rightward in the 1980s, is an increasingly faded memory for voters; he left office nearly 35 years ago and soon disappeared from public view, diagnosed with Alzheimers disease. He died two decades ago.</p><p>Invocations of his name and legacy may have animated Republicans once, but now <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=win+one+for+the+gipper&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS725US725&amp;oq=Win+one+for+the+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i512j69i57j46i512j0i512l2j46i512j0i512l4.2538j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#fpstate=ive&amp;vld=cid:c1c1e07b,vid:_e7rmpjBSR8">the Gipper</a> cant win it for anybody.</p><p>Todays Republican Party is the Trump Party. Even many of its voters who arent solidly MAGAfied nonetheless want Trump in 2024 or  if theyve tired of his maniacal dramas and legal morass  someone like him, just without so much baggage.</p><p>So far, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has dominated that lane. Yes, as governor he did once <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GovRonDeSantis/photos/a.643049992419731/3859796984078333/?type=3">declare</a> Feb. 6, the 40</p>th<p> presidents birthday, as Ronald Reagan Day in Florida. But as a presidential candidate, DeSantis is trying to out-Trump Trump  in the right-wing culture wars, with anti-immigration stunts and by populist attacks on iconic corporations  seemingly without regard to how that performance would damage him for the general election, should he win the Republican nomination.</p><p>Hutchinson once joked to Washington journalists at an annual dinner of their Gridiron Club that for DeSantis to challenge Trump would mark the first time a father and son have ever opposed each other for the presidency. Mini-Me DeSantis does share Trump's superpower  shamelessness  and a zeal for punching back and punching down, though hes only lately starting to do so against the former president.</p><p>The potency of Trumpism is evident in the party: Together, Trump and DeSantis have backing from <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/us/2024_republican_presidential_nomination-7548.html">three-quarters of Republican voters</a>, though DeSantis has slid behind the former president in the polling by roughly 30 percentage points on average. Still, he remains Trumps only rival whose party support is in double digits.</p><p>Republican voters, those who participate in primaries and caucuses, arent looking for a return to Reagans trademark sunny optimism and talk of America as the shining city on the hill. Even before Trump (think Newt Gingrich, and the tea party movement), these voters were looking for scrappers whose rhetoric leaned more toward <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/full-text-donald-trump-inauguration-speech-transcript-233907">American carnage</a> and who validated the voters grievances against the elites. Trump just took the pugilism up a notch</p>,<p>  OK, many notches</p>,<p>  and they were hooked. </p><p>Differences between Reaganism and Trumpism arent just ones of style and rhetoric. Theyre substantive, which also works against those who would be Reagan </p> r<p>edux.</p><p>Theres overlap between the -isms, mainly in favoring tax cuts and deregulation. But Reagans defining policies also included some that are now all but anathema in the Trump Party: He was pro-immigration; the landmark 1986 law he signed included amnesty for millions of undocumented immigrants. He was for free trade, not protectionism. He was anti-communist and condemned the then-Soviet Union as an evil empire  as <a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1635446738906411012">Pence</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PhilipWegmann/status/1635681800746856449">Haley</a> have suggested, Reagan would surely have opposed Russias invasion of Ukraine and supported U.S. assistance to the defenders.</p><p>On Wednesday, Pence, reflecting his Reaganist bent, slammed Trump and DeSantis, too, for being willing to forfeit American leadership on the world stage and to coddle dictators such as Vladimir Putin. Yet he has to know that muscular internationalism is increasingly unpopular among his would-be voters. They flock behind Trumps isolationist America First banner. The intraparty tension is evident in Congress, where Republicans are split over further aid to Ukraine.</p><p>When candidates for president are mired in single digits in the polls, it cant hurt for them to wrap themselves in the mantle of a party icon. But it wont help them either. Reaganism is the past. The Republican Party shows no signs of going back  and certainly not in time for the 2024 primaries.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackiekcalmes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@jackiekcalmes</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Once Donald Trump had received a formal target letter from the department, his fate was effectively sealed.</p><p>But that was only the latest in a series of recent signs that charges were inevitable. The months and years of questions about whether the Biden administration should or would indict the 45th and would-be next president  and whether the department would stay its hand for politics, the good of the republic or some other reason  were settled when Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel.</p><p>From that point on, the investigation of the former president's retention of classified documents has followed the well-worn path that the federal government would tread for any defendant accused of behavior anywhere close to as brazen as Trump's over the last two years. Smith pursued the case as he would have any other, and that led ineluctably to the indictment unsealed Friday.</p><p>Almost as unavoidably, it will also lead to the department urging a court to impose significant prison time on the former president if he is convicted. Trump's last chance to bargain for less grave charges came and went in his lawyers last meeting with Justice officials on Monday. Now he is in the unenviable position of any other defendant charged with such serious crimes.</p> Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">     37-count indictment  </a></p>  includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal. The government alleges that Trump willfully kept sensitive information about U.S. and foreign defense capabilities and shared classified information with people who did not have security clearances. It also charges a conspiracy to obstruct justice involving Trump and his valet Walt Nauta, who reportedly <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/18/walt-nauta-trump-mar-a-lago-documents-witness/" target="_blank">     lied to FBI agents about the presence of sensitive documents,  </a></p>  only to fess up during subsequent questioning. Nauta, who was also charged, is likely to be an important government witness  and, given his long-standing loyalty to Trump, a very credible one. The indictment also confirms that former Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran will be another important government witness, perhaps the most important. He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The relocation of the unprecedented case from Washington, D.C., to Florida is likely to make the case that much stronger. Although it may sound like a procedural detail, a defendant has a constitutionally guaranteed right to be tried where a crime was allegedly committed. A venue mistake could result in consequences as serious as a case being thrown out with no opportunity for retrial. So the department made the strategic call that the case should proceed in the Southern District of Florida, which includes Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and the scene of his allegedly illegal record retention.</p> And  though we learned  only this week of much of the activity there, it appears as if a grand jury has been sitting in Florida for several weeks. That's more than long enough for it to absorb previous testimony in the case, which the department could provide by briefing jurors on what happened in the capital.<p>The location also has the effect of underscoring the most damning aspect of the case for Trump. His </p> knowingly<p> taking documents from the White House was almost certainly criminal; his brazen and quintessentially Trumpian refusal to return them, even to the point of lying to the government and involving others in the concealment, was worse.</p>Indeed, the <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-09/trump-indictment-details-espionage-obstruction-charges">37-count indictment</a></p> includes 31 counts of the almost astonishingly serious charge of violating the Espionage Act, compounding the severity of the case and the sense of national betrayal.

He is the source of a series of incendiary and incriminating statements that the indictment attributes to Trump, including I dont want anybody looking through my boxes" and "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we didn't have anything here?"<p>The venue does heighten the risk that an ardently pro-Trump juror will simply refuse to convict him on any grounds, which given the mind-boggling strength of the evidence might be the defendant's only hope. But the justice system has already proved resilient, having produced another indictment of the ex-president, in New York, and an unfavorable civil verdict in the E. Jean Carroll case. </p><p>With the venue issue put to rest, and with courts in the Florida district known for moving fairly quickly, a trial is likely to unfold sooner if the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/aileen-cannon-trump-judge.html" target="_blank">Trump-appointed judge</a> initially assigned to the case doesn't cause unforeseen delays. Its even possible that Trump will be convicted by a federal jury before the 2024 election, for which he remains the overwhelmingly </p> favored<p> front-runner for the Republican nomination, though his appeals would probably continue.</p><p>The Department of Justice has shown the </p> necessary<p> steeliness and dedication to make history in undertaking this prosecution of a former president. And with Smith still investigating Trump's even more outrageous misconduct on and before Jan. 6, 2021, </p> this <p>first such prosecution may well not be the last. </p><p>Next week, meanwhile, Smith's deputies are expected to take their places at the table near the jury box in a federal courtroom and announce their appearance on behalf of the people in United States vs. Trump. Whatever else happens in the coming months, it's a proud moment and a banner achievement for the rule of law in this country.</p>Harry Litman is the host of the&nbsp;<p><a href="https://www.talkingfeds.com/">Talking Feds podcast</a></p>.&nbsp;<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrylitman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@harrylitman</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"Im not gay, but I think the culture of trying to find some kind of hidden trait or behavior that a closed person let slip is very dangerous.</p><p>Being straight doesnt look one way. Being gay doesnt look one way.</p><p>Not exactly breaking news in 2023, and yet the phrase no homo keeps hanging around, doesnt it? Same goes for straight-acting on gay dating apps  an uncomfortable reminder that being queer doesnt automatically inoculate you from stereotypical thinking.</p><p>And I speak from my own experience.</p><p>When I was in my 20s I wasnt comfortable being around flamboyant gay men. I was out of the closet, but I had brought my insecurities with me. I had told myself the uneasiness stemmed from my being an introvert. The truth is I wanted to be viewed as </p>just <p>a regular dude who just happened to be gay. They, on the other hand, were </p>GAY!<p> I was almost 30 before I understood </p>just <p>how unhealthy my thinking had been.</p><p>Williams has wrapped his mind around the same thing from a different perspective.</p><p>Rather than defend his masculinity, he explained it. Rather than distancing himself from homosexuality and homophobia, he sympathized and also acknowledged that homophobia doesnt </p>just <p>hurt</p>  just<p> gay men.</p><p>Overanalyzing someone's behavior in an attempt to catch them directly contributes to the anxiety a lot of queer and queer-questioning people feel when they fear living in their truth, he said. It also reinforces an archetype many straight men have to live under that is often times unrealistic, less free and limits individual expression. Ive been very clear about the intentionality I try to put into using my platform to push back against those archetypes every chance that I get.</p><p>Williams approach to the conversation is a lot different from that of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-05-17/josh-hawley-manhood-masculinity-jan-6">whose book "Manhood: The Masculine Virtues America Needs" was released last month</a>. </p> Hawley <p>argues that the archetypes Williams </p>is refers toencing <p>are societys cure, not part of the problem.</p>His Hawley's<p> stance devolved into self-parody this week with an op-ed for Fox News about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/lefts-problem-men-bible.amp">the left's problem with men, and the Bible</a>  I kid you not.</p><p>Thousands of American men today are aimless, adrift and struggling, cut off from the good jobs that allowed their fathers and grandfathers to build and support families, he wrote. Theyre not getting married or having kids. Theyre withdrawing from school and the labor force. Meanwhile, the working men who do hold down a job, put in their time, and provide for their kids are lampooned in liberal pop culture as idiots and Neanderthals. Theyre the ones Target and Budweiser think need to be taught to be tolerant and inclusive."</p><p>It's the kind of disingenuous analysis weve come to expect from Hawley, who still tries to come across as Rambo even after the footage of him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/21/us/josh-hawley-video-jan-6.html">cheering and fleeing the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6</a> pretty much showed that persona to be cosplay.</p><p>Which takes us back to one of Williams much-needed points: Straight men are told to live under crushingly narrow guidelines for behavior. It was smart of Hawley to run from the crowd. He was in danger. But his version of manhood doesnt let him acknowledge that. He was probably scared. Thats a healthy part of the full range of human emotion, for masculine-identifying humans just like everyone else.</p><p>Nothing reins in a so-called alpha man faster than the threat of being seen as gay. Ive heard Dont be gay used to stop happy men from dancing in bars and Man up to prevent sad men from expressing sorrow. There are best friends afraid to hug one another because thats gay.</p><p>Homophobia, disguised as masculinity, slowly drains the joy and connection out of life. </p>No wonder men die before women.<p>This is why Williams response </p> was a relief.gave me life. <p>He could have responded to the rumors about his sexual orientation with </p> resentment  anger<p> or fear. Instead he chose compassion. Not sure if that fits Hawley's "biblical" definition of masculinity, but it seemed important to Jesus.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LZGranderson">@LZGranderson</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis showed us the worst way to treat asylum seekers; churches in Sacramento that stepped up and helped these people showed us the Christian way.</description>

What, exactly, would he be trying to accomplish?</p><p>Last year, there was some strained logic, I suppose, in a similar stunt, where DeSantis organized flights of migrants </p> f<p>rom the southern border to Marthas Vineyard.</p><p>You remember that, of course: DeSantis</p> ' <p>minions rounded up several dozen Venezuelan asylum seekers, ranging in age from 2 to 68, in San Antonio in September</p> ,<p> promised them jobs and financial assistance, then flew them in chartered planes at taxpayer expense to Massachusetts. The migrants said they were told they were heading to New York or Boston.</p><p>In the Republican political imagination, Marthas Vineyard is an elite liberal bastion whose residents have no real grasp of the border crisis.</p><p>No one really cared about this in the national media perspective until 50 show up in Marthas Vineyard, <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/what-happened-after-migrants-landed-at-marthas-vineyard/" target="_blank">DeSantis said at the time</a>. (Translation: </p>Nobody was paying attention to me<p>.)</p><p>But in California, home to the busiest border crossing in the world, where the agricultural and service economies would collapse without the labor of immigrant workers  here illegally or not  what on Earth <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-03/california-investigating-who-sent-16-migrants-from-texas-to-doorstep-of-sacramento-diocese">might someone like Cruella DeSantis</a> be trying to prove?</p><p>After all, hes not running against Californias <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-03-01/poll-what-california-voters-think-of-gov-newsom">well-liked </a>Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. </p><p>Hes running against former President Trump, and a host of other Republican hopefuls, all of whom are trailing Trump badly in the polls. But the stranglehold that Trump has on the GOP means that DeSantis cant pick a fight with</p> <p>the former guy for fear of alienating the Republican base, not to mention fear of unleashing Trumps toxic brand of rhetorical annihilation. </p>DeSantis is probably hoping that Chris Christie will be Trump's pain sponge, now that the combative former New Jersey governor has entered the race.<p> (Trumps preferred insult for the Florida governor, Ron DeSanctimonious is ungainly, but apt.)</p><p>Anyway, DeSantis is probably hoping that Chris Christie will be Trump's pain sponge, now that the combative former New Jersey governor has entered the race. </p><p>With the Republican presidential contest in full swing, DeSantis'</p> <p>targeting of Newsom with what is fast becoming a tired gambit counts as simple misplaced aggression. Hes posturing for conservative and independent voters in a way that wont provoke Trump. In fact, using migrants as pawns is right up Trumps alley: cowardly, calculated and cruel.</p><p>And potentially illegal.</p><p>Ron DeSantis, you small, pathetic man, <a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1665769565261840387?s=20" target="_blank">Newsom tweeted Monday</a>. This isnt Marthas Vineyard. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-05/newsom-desantis-migrant-flights-kidnapping-charges">Kidnapping charges</a>? </p><p>To be fair, Newsom has been angling for his</p> <p>own share of national attention by picking on DeSantis. In the past year, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-05/newsom-florida-college-desantis">Newsom has flown to Florida</a> to criticize its governor for imposing his anti-LGBTQ+ values on Florida schools, challenged DeSantis to a debate, and run a TV ad inviting Floridians to join us in California. </p><p>In DeSantis apparent latest bid for the national spotlight, on Friday, 16 migrants from Colombia and Venezuela were flown to Sacramento from Texas via New Mexico. Twenty more arrived Monday. No arrangements had been made for their care; they were dropped off on the doorstep of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sacramento with documents that appeared to be from the Florida state government, according to California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta.</p><p>DeSantis is not the only red state governor using human beings to tweak Democrats. The day after the migrants landed on Marthas Vineyard last summer, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent two busloads of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harris Washington doorstep.</p><p>Fortunately, pushback to this transparent political ploy is gaining steam.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/migrants-file-class-action-suit-against-florida-gov-ron-desantis-2022-9" target="_blank">federal class action lawsuit</a> was filed against DeSantis and other Florida officials in September by a civil rights law firm on behalf of the migrants who were flown to Marthas Vineyard. It alleges that the migrants' constitutional rights were violated when they were tricked into boarding planes and abandoned once they landed.</p><p>On Monday, the Texas Tribune</p> <p>reported, the Bexar County Sheriffs Office in Texas announced it had filed criminal charges against unnamed suspects in connection with the Marthas Vineyard</p> <p>caper</p> .<p> The charges include several counts of unlawful restraint, both misdemeanors and felonies, said the Tribune. It remains to be seen whether the local district attorney will prosecute.</p><p>And Bonta has launched an investigation into the circumstances under which the most recent group of transported asylum seekers landed in</p> <p> California.</p><p>We are also evaluating potential criminal or civil action against those who transported or arranged for the transport of these vulnerable immigrants, Bonta said in a statement. State-sanctioned kidnapping is not a public policy choice, it is immoral and disgusting.</p><p>Whats especially pathetic about red state leaders trying to garner headlines by sending migrants to blue states and cities is that local and state officials have no control over border policy.</p><p>That responsibility lies squarely with Congress, which has dithered for decades. Last month, the House passed an immigration bill that critics say would end asylum </p> in the U.S. <p>entirely</p> <p>and restart construction on Trump's failed border wall. President Biden has said he would veto the bill, which is very unlikely to pass in the Senate.</p><p>In any case, both parties have expressed the hope that the legislation, contentious as it is,<a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/05/11/house-passed-border-bill-may-spark-bipartisan-immigration-talks/" target="_blank"> could signal </a>the start of serious bipartisan cooperation on the issue. Im looking for any port in a storm, Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters last month.</p><p>So are the hundreds of thousands of poor, tired and huddled masses who come to these shores yearning to breathe free. Allowing cynics like DeSantis to exploit migrants to make political points tarnishes what we've always believed is best about us.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/robinkabcarian" target="_blank">@robinkabcarian</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Gen. Todd Rokita began a campaign of harassment against her. She is exactly the kind of thoughtful and courageous physician we need at a moment when womens reproductive rights are being trampled in state</p> <p>houses around the country.</p><p>Seeing clips of her wiping away tears and defending herself for nearly 15 hours in a hearing room is proof that we are now living in a dystopia where logic and proportion, to quote Grace Slick, have fallen sloppy dead.</p><p>About a year ago, four</p> <p>days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, Bernard was at an abortion rights rally, talking about the girls case with a colleague. A reporter for the Indianapolis Star</p> <p>who was working on a story about the effects of the Supreme Courts decision overheard her and asked her about it.</p><p>Without divulging any information that compromised her patients confidentiality, Bernard said she had received a call from a child abuse doctor in Ohio, where abortion had suddenly become illegal after six weeks of pregnancy. A youngster who was three days over the limit needed abortion care. In a sane world, a state would not force a 10-year-old to bear a child after rape, or to cross state lines for help.</p><p>Yet here we are.</p><p>The Star story caught fire. Even President Biden decried the injustice. Conservatives went wild, accusing Bernard of making the story up. Another lie. Anyone surprised? brayed Ohio Republican U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jim-jordan-quietly-deletes-tweet-branding-case-of-10-year-old-ohio-girls-abortion-a-lie" target="_blank">Jim Jordan in a tweet he later deleted.</a></p><p>The Republican attorney general of Ohio flatly stated on Fox News </p>[July 11] <p>that there was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11007219/Republican-Ohio-AG-claims-not-whisper-heard-rape-victim-10-got-abortion.html" target="_blank">not a whisper anywhere</a> of a 10-year-old being raped in his state. He was either lying or out of the loop. Two days later, <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/13/columbus-man-charged-rape-10-year-old-led-abortion-in-indiana/10046625002/" target="_blank">the Columbus Dispatch reported</a> </p>[July 13]<p>that there had been an arrest and confession in the case. Also, it turns out, the child was 9 when she was raped.</p><p>Rokitas blatantly unprofessional behavior continued to inflame the situation. He described Bernard to Fox News as this abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failing to report. In violation of state law, he publicly discussed his plan to investigate Bernard, which a judge said caused her irreparable harm.</p><p>The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission launched <a href="https://indianacitizen.org/new-from-the-indiana-citizen-rokita-under-investigation-by-disciplinary-commission-outside-counsels-petition-confirms/" target="_blank">an investigation into Rokita</a> after the former dean of </p>the  Indiana University   's  law school<p> filed a complaint against him. If he can throw the entire weight of his office without consequence to attack Dr. Bernard, he can do so to target any private citizen with whom he disagrees, wrote Lauren Robel, the former dean. This is the opposite of the rule of law.</p><p>Bernard, who has been threatened and harassed, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/19/1112246418/indianas-ag-could-face-a-lawsuit-by-the-abortion-provider-for-10-year-old-rape-v" target="_blank">has notified Rokita </a>that she may sue him for defamation; she has until July 2024 to file a lawsuit.</p><p>Rokita, for his part, behaved as if hed won a huge victory after the medical board hearing. Thanks to my amazing team, <a href="https://twitter.com/AGToddRokita/status/1661955229892460544?s=20" target="_blank">he tweeted,</a> the abortion doctor got the maximum civil fine for violating three counts of privacy laws and received a public reprimand to go into a national database. </p><p>Donna Shalala, the former </p> U.S. <p>Health and Human Services secretary who helped draft <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html#:~:text=Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and%20Accountability%20Act%20of%201996%20(HIPAA),-Print&amp;text=The%20Health%20Insurance%20Portability%20and,the%20patient's%20consent%20or%20knowledge." target="_blank">the federal HIPAA patient privacy law,</a> told the Indianapolis Star that <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/2023/05/26/doctors-react-indiana-abortion-case-caitlin-bernard-reprimand/70261267007/" target="_blank">there was no way</a> Bernard had disclosed enough information to identify her young patient. Theyre criminalizing the practice of medicine, she said, and theyre literally asking doctors in this country to do harm.</p><p>The endgame of political cynics like Rokita is the complete banning of abortion in America, despite <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/" target="_blank">overwhelming public sentiment</a> that it should be legal in most circumstances.</p><p>I wish I could say a total ban is never going to happen, but Ive given up making predictions about the strength of our democracys guardrails or the Supreme Courts dedication to human rights.</p><p>One thing we are able to predict with a high degree of confidence, though, is the number of people who will die if they are forced to bear children they dont want. It is incontrovertibly true that childbirth is far more dangerous to a womans health than abortion.</p><p>This countrys maternal mortality rate is already shamefully high </p> for acompared to other<p> wealthy nation</p>s<p>. An estimated 23.8 maternal deaths occur in the U.S. for every 100,000 births, almost three times </p> more higher<p> than </p> in <p>most peer nations.</p><p>University of Colorado sociologist <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34693444/" target="_blank">Amanda Stevenson predicted in a 2021 paper</a> that if both maternal mortality rates and the number of pregnancies per year remained constant, a total abortion ban would raise the maternal mortality rate by about 21% in the overall population, and by about 33% among Black people.</p><p>This is</p> ,<p> of course, a sweeping hypothetical, but it makes sense.</p><p>As Stevenson writes, The coming abortion bans, if totally successful in preventing people from getting wanted abortions, will increase maternal deaths simply because childbirth in the U.S. is much deadlier than induced abortion.</p><p>Do anti</p>-<p>abortion extremists understand the inherent cruelty of forcing a 10-year-old to give birth? If doctors like </p> Caitlin Bernard<p> are silenced, </p> opponents they<p> will never face the awful truth of what the Supreme Court has wrought.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/robinkabcarian" target="_blank">@robinkabcarian</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Since then, weve seen red states rush <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/abortion-policy-tracker/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">to ban all or nearly all abortions,</a> some without exceptions for rape, incest or threats to a pregnant womans life.</p><p>What we havent seen is those same states doing what their pro-life Republican leaders promised amid their celebrations of the conservative courts ruling: to finally deliver better healthcare and anti-poverty policies for needy women forced to give birth, and for their kids.</p><p>Among the most prominent promisers was Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, the state that brought the </p> winning <p>antiabortion case, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf">Dobbs vs. Jackson Womens Health Organization,</a> to the Supreme Court</p> ,<p> and </p> that<p> is a perennial bottom-dweller in rankings of the states safety nets. Reeves <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/sotu/date/2022-05-08/segment/01">proclaimed </a>on national television networks, We must show that being pro-life is not just about being anti</p>-<p>abortion and do everything we can to make it easier on those moms who may be in unwanted pregnancies and to ensure that those babies, once born, have a productive life.</p><p>Most </p>of<p> state legislatures have held their 2023 sessions; those with antiabortion majorities have had </p> the <p>time and opportunity to make good on their promises to st</p> r<p>engthen thei</p> r<p> states' safety nets. Alas, few things were more predictable than the fact </p> that <p>they wouldnt.</p><p>A similar political dynamic is at work with gun policies. After each mass shooting, Republicans say attention to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/10/texas-mass-shootings-mental-health/">mental health, not firearm restrictions,</a> is the answer. Yet gun</p>-<p> safety groups see little follow-through on the former. Besides, as John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, says, This is not an either/or situation  states can invest in mental health services while also passing laws to prevent people with dangerous histories from buying guns.</p><p>When it comes to abortion bans and post-Dobbs policies,<b> </b>the gap between bold talk about compassion for disadvantage</p> d<p> women and children and action on their behalf is particularly stark.</p><p>After the Dobbs decision, Mississippi quickly banned abortion except in cases where a womans life is in danger or when a pregnancy results from a rape, </p>if<p> the rape has been reported to police. But the state  first in the nation in both overall <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/poorest-states">poverty</a> and <a href="https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17826#P1259dd2a77bb45c2bcf5406663864009_2_241iT3">child poverty,</a> and second from the last in <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/mississippi">healthcare</a>  still refuses to take the single step that would help the most low-income families: It is one of just 10 states, all of them with Republican-controlled legislatures, Republican governors or both, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/">that hasnt expanded Medicaid</a> for certain uninsured low-income adults and children, even though the feds mostly pick up the tab under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Economists say the state is forfeiting about $1.5 billion annually to provide roughly 300,000 residents with healthcare, according to <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2023/05/01/few-lawmakers-oppose-medicaid-expansion/">Mississippi Today.</a> And yet, the publication reported, There was no serious push by Republicans in the 2023 session to even debate expansion, let alone vote on it.</p><p>And why should the legislators act? Reeves, who would have to sign any Medicaid expansion into law, remains adamantly opposed, as is the state</p> 's<p> House speaker. Its socialism, the Republicans say.</p><p>The big-talking governor did relent on one policy that he and the </p> L<p>egislature have previously <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-mississippi-medicaid-c49dcbdc7b356f593485853aee5458c1">opposed:</a> He recently <a href="https://apnews.com/article/mississippi-medicaid-postpartum-birth-abortion-ad3f32d293f267fe0a125a69b5def7d5">signed</a> a bill giving women who qualify for the states limited Medicaid coverage a full year of postpartum care, up from just two months. Healthcare, business and grassroots groups had long pressed for the extended care</p> ,<p> and with good reason. The states mortality rate for women in the year following <a href="">the end of a pregnancy</a> is nearly double the national average, and deaths have long been disproportionately high among Black women.</p><p>The story is much the same in more populous Texas, the long Republican-controlled state that pioneered a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-09-02/with-texas-abortion-law-a-far-fetched-dystopia-has-come-to-pass">dystopian bounty law</a> to snare anyone who aided or abetted an abortion  before it and other states got the Supreme Courts green light to ban them.</p><p><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/26/texas-postpartum-medicaid-extension/">Until just days ago,</a> Texas also long resisted providing Medicaid to women for more than two months after a pregnancy, despite <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/12/15/texas-maternal-mortality-report/">increasing maternal mortality rates</a> and the pleas of medical experts. At the end of its session, the Legislature extended postpartum care to one year. The state still refuses Obamacares invitation to expand Medicaid to uninsured low-wage workers generally, though one out of four women of childbearing age is uninsured  <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/09/texas-abortion-law-medicaid-contraception/">the highest share in the nation.</a> And, <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2022/07/14/foster-care-system-tate-reeves/">like Mississippi,</a> Texas has been embroiled in a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/02/09/texas-foster-care-lawsuit/">years-long lawsuit</a> against the shameful record of abuse in its foster care system.</p><p>A headline in the Texas Tribune a year ago said it all: Texas isnt ready to support more parents and kids in a post-Roe world, advocates warn. Little has changed.</p><p>Ditto in other antiabortion states, which likewise provide the least support for </p> poor impoverished <p>women and children.<b> </b>Instead of new investments in anti</p> -<p>poverty programs, for instance, the focus has been on promoting adoptions and effectively outlawing private funds that use contributions to defray womens costs </p> when they goof going<p> to other states for abortions.</p><p>And, as the pro-abortion</p> -<p>rights Guttmacher Institute and Planned Parenthood have tracked, Republican-run states including Florida, Ohio, Missouri and Arkansas are channeling state taxpayers dollars to so-called crisis pregnancy centers, mostly faith-based clinics that oppose abortion and often spread misinformation about its risks. At least 10 states have diverted money from the chief federal welfare program  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF  to grants for the antiabortion centers.<b> </b></p><p>In May 2022, when the news leaked that the Supreme Court would strike down Roe vs. Wade, and Republicans were promising they'd finally apply "pro-life" activism to what happens after birth, I made a mental note to check their progress in a year  right about now. </p><p> I suspected they'd renege.<b> </b>Sometimes you hate to be right.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackiekcalmes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@jackiekcalmes</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Police departments, once threatened with defunding, <a href="https://abc7.com/where-police-departments-defunded-how-does-funding-impact-crime-defund-the-budgets/12324846/">saw their budgets increased</a> in many cities around the country.</p><p>In the run-up to the midterm elections last fall, crime ranked as the second-most important issue for voters, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/politics/crime-issue-midterms-election/index.html" target="_blank">according to Gallup</a>.</p><p>The battle is on, and it was against this backdrop that I read last week that Boudin  the 42-year-old public defender-turned-prosecutor-turned-private citizen  has been hired by the UC Berkeley School of Law <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/chesa-boudin-new-job/3242815/">to be the executive director</a> of a new Criminal Law </p> &amp;<p> Justice Center.</p><p>The center will do litigation, legislative advocacy and public education, presumably aimed at reforming our often unfair, punitive and inefficient criminal justice system.</p><p>But I was particularly pleased to hear, when I called Boudin to talk about the new job, that hes also emphasizing another area: data analysis and research. He says hes tired of the public conversation about crime policy being devoid of science or data or even short-term memory.</p><p>Its about time.</p><p>Its long been a truism that attitudes about crime and punishment are cyclical, characterized by pendulum swings of leniency followed by a desire to crack down and lock up everybody indefinitely. Public sentiment mostly depends on whether crime seems to be rising or falling.</p><p>But often those mood shifts are based on how safe people </p>feel<p> rather than how safe they actually are; they're driven not by facts but by emotion, fear and grisly anecdotes. Public policy often gets made in response to banner headlines and sensational tweets, and by politicians reading polls.</p><p>Whats more, theres powerful political pressure from police and prison guard unions, rank-and-file prosecutors and crime victims groups whose scare stories encourage a return to the throw-away-the-keys policies they believe in. On the other side, progressive reformers can also be ideologically rigid and driven by emotion, just like their opponents.</p><p>So Im all for more hard information about what's happening, what works and what doesnt. Boudin notes that legislatures have a tendency to pass laws but not to look back a year or two later to analyze their outcomes. Or they set up pilot programs and then, bizarrely, dont study the results.</p><p>Here are some things I'd like to know (although I don't mean to suggest they haven't been studied):</p><p>When we divert people from the criminal justice system to substance abuse treatment or mental health care, do they clean up their acts or do they reoffend?</p><p>When we release more suspects before trial, do crime rates rise dramatically or insignificantly? </p><p>Do <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-16/this-is-not-the-end-l-a-advocates-say-veto-doesnt-shut-door-to-safe-injection-sites">safe consumption sites</a> encourage drug use? And if so, how do you weigh that against the lives they save by preventing overdoses?</p><p>Boudin is a well-known advocate of progressive criminal justice reform policies. I asked him whether his data analysis would be designed simply to confirm his preconceived notions. He bristled.</p><p>I have my worldview, my lived experience and my professional experience, but that doesnt mean were going to be outcome-oriented in our research, he said. I want policy choices to be supported by facts, not by the dearth of information we have now.</p><p>For my part, I support criminal justice reform, but Im not an ideologue. I believe we incarcerate too many people who actually need treatment. We make it far too difficult for ex-offenders to reenter society. There are glaring inequities, racial and otherwise, in the bail system and the sentencing process. Were too tolerant of inhumane treatment and excessive force.</p><p>But I also believe dangerous people need to be kept off the streets. I think police should be permitted to do their jobs, as long as they do so fairly and responsibly.</p><p>I'd welcome more research to help policymakers develop smart, humane, effective strategies for fighting crime and rehabilitating offenders.</p><p>Boudin is a fascinating figure whose backstory has been told so often its become perhaps too familiar. His mother, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2022-05-02/kathy-boudin-radical-imprisoned-in-fatal-heist-dies-at-78">Kathy Boudin</a>, was a member of the radical Weather Underground and in 1981 took part in a holdup of a Brinks armored truck during which three people died. She spent 22 years in prison. His father, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/nyregion/david-gilbert-brinks-parole.html" target="_blank">David Gilbert</a>, spent 40 years in prison for participating in the same crime.</p><p>That means their son spent most of his youth and young adulthood traipsing in and out of prisons to visit them, even as he became a lawyer, a public defender and then a prosecutor. He believes that </p> his <p>"lived experience" helps him bridge the gap between the real world and whats being discussed by lawmakers in Sacramento.</p><p>Boudin was recalled from his job as district attorney by voters who, in my view, didnt give him enough of a chance. Let's see if he and Berkeley Law's new center can produce useful</p> <p>data and innovative</p> <p>policy recommendations</p> <p>that will</p> <p>stop</p> <p>the pendulum and make policing and prosecuting more just. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nick_goldberg?lang=en" target="_blank">@nick_goldberg </a></p>                                     </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s 2003 prediction that affirmative action college admissions would only last 25 more years may come true if the current court has its way. That would be tragic.</description>

Why would we? It is an imperfect remedy designed to redress a shameful history  an </p>ongoing<p> history  of racism and exclusion. It requires that people be judged, and in some cases denied opportunity, based on the color of their skin.</p><p>It's built on the premise that society cannot always be colorblind, which goes against everything we have been taught to believe and would like to believe about ourselves.</p><p>Thats one reason so many people prefer to view</p> <p>affirmative action as merely a temporary fix that will one day no longer be needed. <a href="https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/19970610-1444.html" target="_blank">President Clinton said in 1995</a>: Affirmative action should not go on forever It should be retired when its job is done.</p><p>That argument </p>  <p>that affirmative action is constitutional but should be "limited in time"</p>   <p>was made most famously by Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor in the case of Grutter vs. Bollinger. The court expects that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary...,</p> " <p>she wrote for the majority. </p><p>That was in</p> <p>2003. Now with OConnors supposed deadline approaching, the Supreme Court is about to hand down a decision in two explosive affirmative action cases, </p> one<p> involving Harvard University and the other, the University of North Carolina. Many experts believe the </p> c<p>urrent right-wing court is on the verge of overturning decades of precedent by prohibiting the consideration of race as a factor in college and university admissions.</p><p>A decision declaring affirmative action unconstitutional would apparently be fine with most Americans. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/most-americans-think-college-admissions-should-not-consider-race-reutersipsos-2023-02-15/" target="_blank">Reuters/Ipsos poll in February</a> found that 62% do not believe race or ethnicity should be considered in college admissions.</p><p>But theyre wrong. Affirmative action is both morally justified and badly needed. Banning</p> <p>it would be an enormous mistake. </p><p>And just to be clear, OConnors 25-year time frame  which was cited repeatedly by the courts conservative justices <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/20-1199_6537.pdf">during oral arguments</a>  was never really a deadline at all. It was at best a prediction or maybe just an expression of hope that proved overly optimistic. Fourteen years later, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/equity-asian-american-discrimination-racism-affirmative-action-supreme-court-students-fair-admissions-harvard-unc-11667247678">OConnor told her biographer</a>, Evan Thomas: That may have been a misjudgment. </p><p>When asked how long affirmative action would be necessary, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/oconnor-book-chronicles-her-dementia-010634537.html">she told another interviewer</a>: Theres no timetable. You just dont know.</p><p>I dont know either, but I do know that today, the wrongs of American racism are still being undone, and affirmative action remains a critical tool in the process. Even though the Supreme Court has ruled that affirmative action is legally justified only by its role in fostering "diverse" student bodies, I believe its chief benefit is as a remedy for the harmful effects of past discrimination.</p><p>College, the great gateway to the middle class, was for most of U.S. history limited to white students. It wasn't until the early 1960s, during the Kennedy administration, that the integration of college campuses began in earnest, and that taking affirmative actions to undo racism became part of the lexicon. </p><p>Today, however, despite significant gains, students of color remain unconscionably disadvantaged. <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/racial-and-ethnic-equity-in-us-higher-education" target="_blank">A 2022 McKinsey study</a>, among others, showed that Black and Latino people, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders are still underrepresented among college undergraduates, faculty and administrators. </p>At current rates of change, McKinsey concluded, it would take 70 years for all not-for-profit colleges and universities to reflect underrepresented students fully in their incoming student population.<p>Today, white college applicants are still more likely than nonwhites to have attended higher performing, better funded schools. Their families are more likely to have benefited from wealth accumulation. Theyre more likely to qualify for legacy preferences.</p>According to the not-for-profit EdBuild in 2019, predominantly white local school districts in the U.S. collectively receive $23 billion more annually than non-white districts.<p>African Americans are more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend under-resourced high schools. Former Columbia University president Lee Bollinger and </p> University of Chicago <p>law professor Geoffrey Stone <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard-admissions/671914/">have written</a> that predominantly nonwhite school districts are less likely to offer access to college-prep-level math and science courses. Unsurprisingly, Black students still trail white students in general educational attainment.</p><p><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/50-years-after-the-kerner-commission/" target="_blank">The Economic Policy Institute notes</a> that Black Americans are just over half as likely as white Americans to have a college degree. Yet college degrees are key drivers of social mobility, helping those who need it find a path out of poverty. </p><p>Campus diversity, meanwhile, benefits everybody, white students included. Studies show that diversity helps fight racial bias and prejudice. It helps wash away stereotypes.</p><p>Sure, affirmative action should be temporary. I look forward to that glorious and hopefully not mythical day when the United States no longer struggles with the aftereffects of slavery, segregation and bigotry and the continued effects of institutionalized discrimination.</p><p>But wed be foolish to set a deadline for that.</p><p>In the meantime, the Supreme Court will do what it will do. If affirmative action is prohibited entirely, it could lead to a precipitous decline in nonwhite admissions. </p><p>California banned affirmative action in admissions to the University of California and other state institutions when it passed Proposition 209 in 1996, and the number of nonwhite students promptly plummeted. Despite more than 25 years of outreach programs to low-income students, and </p> despite<p> re-crafted race-neutral admissions policies, UC still "struggles to enroll a student body that is sufficiently racially diverse to attain the educational benefits of diversity, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-31/california-banned-affirmative-action-uc-struggles-for-diversity">wrote UC president Michael Drake</a> and all 10 campus chancellors in an amicus brief in the current case.</p> It's <p>possible the court could take a less radical approach than that, with a narrow</p> <p>ruling</p> <p>tied </p>more<p> closely to</p> <p>Harvard and UNC, rather than one prohibiting</p> <p>the consideration of race in admissions at schools all around the country. </p><p>The justices may nod to</p> <p>race-neutral approaches to diversifying colleges and universities, such as giving admissions preference to applicants based on socioeconomic status, or eliminating legacy and donor admissions preferences. Some of these are valuable, promising ideas; others would be less effective. </p>Over the years, the court has looked favorably on such race-neutral approaches, but a New York Times article earlier this week suggested that even those may now be offensive to the courts more conservative judges.<p>All in all, though, the prospects for affirmative action are pretty grim. It would be a tragedy for a country as troubled as ours, still wrestling to move beyond our own ugly racial history, to take a giant step backward instead of forward.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nick_goldberg?lang=en" target="_blank">@nick_goldberg</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

In announcing his own candidacy for the White House on Monday, former Vice President Mike Pence made it official: Donald Trump 2024 is running against his own first big decision from 2016.</p><p>Awkward.</p><p>Meanwhile Nikki Haley, a candidate herself, went on Fox News to remind everyone of the choice Joe Biden made in 2020 after he received the Democratic nomination.</p><p>A vote for President Biden is actually a vote for President Harris, she said on Fox News. Make no bones about it.  Every liberal knows  its Kamala Harris thats gonna end up being president if Joe Biden wins this election.</p><p>Now, in case you didnt get the memo, Haley has this generational change narrative shes been workshopping on the campaign trail. The former governor of South Carolina started banging this drum back in February when <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/21/older-voters-nikki-haley-competency-test-00083859">she proposed a competency test for politicians over 75</a>. It didnt catch on. Shes apparently moved on to an updated version of a 2020 scare tactic: Bidens age will prevent him from finishing the term  hence a President Harris.</p><p>Haleys comments are a bit silly. The reason we have vice presidents is in case something happens to the president  not in case theyre old. Ideally, the vice president pick is someone the nominee believes can do the job as well as bring excitement (Harris) or stability (Pence) to the ticket.</p><p>The hope is that the selection is more about qualifications than politics. When it comes to Harris, conservatives like Haley remain hungry to test that out, because they see a political opening. Their hunt began in 2020, the moment Biden made it clear his pick would be a Black woman. The more crowded the GOP field becomes this time around, the more frenzied their rhetoric about Harris is sure to become.</p><p>So give them what they want.</p><p>If the point of having a vice president is having a backup in case the president is unable to serve, why not own Bidens choice? That doesnt mean dwelling on his age as much as it means not allowing Haley and others to turn Bidens choice of vice president into a negative. Especially given the current relationship between Trump and Pence.</p><p>We know Haleys scare tactic wasnt intended to sow dissension on the left, because  well, she was speaking on Fox News. So that President Harris specter was meant for Republican voters who would hate not only the thought of a Biden successor who could deliver on his promises, but also the image of Harris being the commander-in-chief doing it.</p><p>Its something comedian Roy Wood Jr. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/roy-wood-jr-most-nervous-joke-white-house-correspondents-dinner-1235477742/">touched on while hosting this years White House Correspondents Assn. dinner:</a></p><p>I think the most insulting scandal to fall to the feet of the Biden administration was placed at the feet of our Madam Vice President  the scandal of What does Kamala do? Thats a disrespectful question, because nobody ever asked that question of a vice president until a woman got the job.</p><p>Specifically, a Black woman. Critics were primed to attack no matter what she did or didnt accomplish.</p><p>But consider the source. Most of the barbs aimed at Harris come from Republican detractors, members of the party whose front-runner was recently convicted of sexual assault, the party with a habit of catering to white nationalists. With their racist and sexist baggage, using President Harris as a boogeyman is especially disgusting. Also effective.</p><p>Theres no getting around it.</p><p>So Biden should not allow opponents to use a "President Harris" narrative as a sign of his frailty; it's a strength. His first big decision as the nominee was historic. Now, go remind voters why it was also right ... which is something Trump can't do.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/LZGranderson">@LZGranderson</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

At the end of May, he attacked Trump as <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hes-been-attacking-me-by-moving-left-desantis-castigates-trumps-record-on-ben-shapiros-show/">pro-amnesty</a> for his one-time support of a failed GOP<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-congress-whitehouse/trump-supports-republican-immigration-bills-in-u-s-house-white-house-idUSKBN1JB2ZR"> bill</a> that would have legalized some immigrants brought here as children in exchange for more border militarization and cuts to legal immigration. And last weekend, DeSantis met with families of victims of the 9/11 terror attacks as they criticized Trumps decision to host a Saudi-funded golf tournament.</p><p>On Tuesday, Trump sought to reclaim his position as the No. 1 anti-immigrant crusader by <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/breaking-down-the-birthright-citizenship-debate">reviving</a> one of the most extreme ideas explored during his presidency: an executive order ending birthright citizenship.</p><p>The proposed order, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/31/donald-trump-birthright-us-citizenship">he promised to sign his first day in office if reelected</a>, would face immediate legal challenges for its clear <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/birthright-citizenship-constitution/574381/">violation</a> of the Constitutions 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to everyone born in the U.S. His plan relies on a tortured reading of the amendment from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/citizenship-shouldnt-be-a-birthright/2018/07/18/7d0e2998-8912-11e8-85ae-511bc1146b0b_story.html">pseudo-intellectuals</a> at Californias Claremont Institute, such as Trumps former lawyer John Eastman, a key player in the effort to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/trump-pence-election-memo-fact-check/index.html">overturn</a> the 2020 election who also wrote an unhinged article <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/some-questions-kamala-harris-about-eligibility-opinion-1524483">questioning</a> Vice President Kamala Harris citizenship (it led to an editors apology).</p><p>If the Supreme Court ruled in Trumps favor  not impossible to imagine  it would <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/birthright-citizenship-constitution/574381/">defy</a> more than a century of legal precedent. And it would create a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/birthright-citizenship-constitution/574381/">shadow population</a> of millions of U.S.-born people who could be jailed and deported. In the eyes of restrictionists, it would all be worth it for a decline in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/05/30/trump-birthright-citizenship-immigrants/">anchor babies</a>, their slur for the U.S.-born children of people who lack legal immigration status.</p><p>But restrictionists are skeptical that Trump would follow through on his promise given his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-executive-orders/2020/10/29/c2329162-17bd-11eb-aeec-b93bcc29a01b_story.html">record </a>of sloppy executive orders and their chaotic implementation. Past orders were often blocked by courts.</p><p>I fear this will be one more example of him writing up an executive order and either it fizzles out or they dont pursue it with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves, Mark Krikorian, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/mark-krikorian-the-provocateur-standing-in-the-way-of-immigration-reform/2013/06/17/dff0bd52-d75e-11e2-a9f2-42ee3912ae0e_story.html">lead architect </a>of the 21st century movement to strangle legal and illegal immigration, told me. He frowns on Trumps occasional expressions of <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/05/trump-state-of-the-union-legal-immigration-1148629">support</a> for legal immigration.</p><p>Hes not even a restrictionist, he complained to me, criticizing Trumps failure to stop guest worker and other visa programs. Krikorian heads the Center for Immigration Studies, classified as an anti-immigrant <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/center-immigration-studies">hate group</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center despite Krikorians claims to the contrary. He prefers DeSantis over Trump.</p><p>So do some open white nationalists, who cheer on his policies and rhetoric online and see them as <a href="https://vdare.com/articles/fl-gov-desantis-outbids-trump-criticizes-legal-immigration">signs</a> that hes more hostile toward overall immigration, which is important for those who fear demographic change. DeSantis recently signed Senate Bill 1718, which turned Florida into the most anti-immigrant state in the nation. It <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-05-05/scapegoating-immigrant-victims-texas-greg-abbott-ron-desantis-florida-laws">makes it a felony</a> to give undocumented people rides, jobs or shelter; requires employers to verify workers immigration statuses and invalidates certain out-of-state drivers licenses for undocumented people. DeSantis also <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/court-rejects-challenge-to-sanctuary-cities-law/">banned</a> sanctuary cities in his state.</p><p>Some of DeSantis actions were on the wish list of Trumps senior advisor Stephen Miller, whose ideas <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/24/905403716/hatemonger-paints-trump-advisor-stephen-miller-as-a-case-study-in-radicalization">were shaped</a> by Krikorians Center for Immigration Studies and other groups <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/john-tanton">created</a> by John Tanton  a well-connected white supremacist who fathered the modern nativist movement. But </p>while  although<p> Miller did push Trump in a more hardline direction on overall immigration, he wasnt able to implement the full Tanton agenda because of his <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/hatemonger-jean-guerrero?variant=32129863974946">inexperience and an uphill battle</a> in a White House with more <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/miller-and-kushner-on-a-potential-collision-course-as-trumps-border-crisis-builds/2019/04/10/81f91530-5a45-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html">moderate</a> voices on the immigration issue, such as Jared Kushner.</p><p>Miller <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/devine-and-ingraham-battle-stephen-miller-over-trumps-attacks-on-desantis-full-of-grievance-and-anger/">remains loyal</a> to Trump. But DeSantis is positioning himself as more in line with Miller than Trump himself, who sometimes caved to pressure to temper his harsh positions, such as when he called off family separations at the border in response to national outrage.</p><p>Trumps promise to end birthright citizenship seeks to correct the notion that hes the less ruthless candidate. One shudders to imagine how DeSantis will try to one-up Trumps threat. Those two guys are in a white nationalist arms race, Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, told me.</p><p>At the core of the GOPs ever-expanding multiverse of scapegoats are immigrant communities, who represent a real threat to white male minority rule. The GOP has </p>proven proved <p>its just getting started with persecution of them. Whether its a Trump or DeSantis White House, it</p>ll would<p> be worse than anything that came before.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jeanguerre?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@jeanguerre</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But lately I keep running into smart people who disagree.</p><p>Earlier this month, I was on a PEN World Voices Festival <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOKOtdhECgk">panel</a> at the L.A. Central Library with author and TV producer Reza Aslan and Hollywoods Black List founder Franklin Leonard. Each said focusing on polarization can promote a false equivalency.</p><p>It is a fact that other Americans are a direct threat to my way of life, Leonard said. It is not a fact that my way of life is a threat to theirs.</p><p>Aslan agreed: Im not sure whats so wrong with polarization. I really dont understand what the issue is  if the other person on the other side of the aisle doesnt even understand my dignity as a human being, then Im perfectly fine being in a different camp. Like I want polarization.</p><p><a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/09/trump-maga-far-right-liberals-polarization">Numerous</a> <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/04/29/political-polarization-isnt-the-real-problem-in-america-one-pole-is-a-lot-worse-than-the-other/">recent</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/168881/must-fight-better-america-no-choice">stories</a> in left-of-center media have been making similar cases: The problem isnt polarization but, rather, the GOP-led assault on the rights of millions of Americans.</p><p>I agree that this assault is the bigger problem. But if it becomes a faux pas to care about the distance between us and the people whod like to restrict our rights, how can we hope to overcome political stalemates and win basic protections  let alone progress? Polarization <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/">inhibits engagement</a> with the other side, and engagement is how Ive always imagined coalitions form to bring about change.</p><p>When so many smart people on my side are embracing this kind of distance, I have to wonder: Is it strategic? One recent <a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/04/29/political-polarization-isnt-the-real-problem-in-america-one-pole-is-a-lot-worse-than-the-other/">Salon article</a> in defense of polarization cited </p> the Rev.<p> Martin Luther King Jr.s Letter From Birmingham Jail. So I read it.</p><p>From a jail cell in 1963 after his arrest for protesting segregation, the preeminent civil rights leader eloquently responds to white clergymens complaints that even though his protests were peaceful, they somehow still incite to hatred and violence.</p><p>King elucidates the absurdity of that claim, while acknowledging that his protests promote constructive nonviolent tension. He writes: I must confess that I am not afraid of the word tension. </p><p>For King, polarization wasnt a problem. It was a necessary byproduct of the struggle for equality. But he refused an us-versus-them conception. The evil wasnt the other side. It was some individuals decision to break with those who were different from them, rather than bridge divides. Birmingham leaders repeatedly made that choice by refusing to engage in good-faith negotiation with Black activists.</p><p>King is an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/01/16/martin-luther-king-dream-speech-colorblind-racism">often-cited figure</a> among Republicans who like to twist his words to characterize affirmative action and reparations as racist. Theyd benefit from revisiting his body of work. So would many liberals, who pay lip service to his faith in love as a transformative social force but cultivate a vitriol for opponents mirroring the MAGA factions.</p><p>In his 1958 book Stride Toward Freedom, the pastor wrote: To meet hate with retaliatory hate would do nothing but intensify the existence of evil in the universe. Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness.</p><p>Violence takes polarization to an extreme. While some civil rights activists back then embraced violent tactics, it was nonviolent demonstrators who transformed public opinion and secured unprecedented legislative wins, alongside the NAACP.</p><p>The people who advocated violence had no significant successes, Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA, told me. When there were violent protests or riots like the Watts riots in Los Angeles, it empowered things like the rise of Reagan. It empowered an intense white reaction that went to support the conservative side.</p><p>King warned against <a href="https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/nonviolence">not only physical violence</a> but also verbal violence and even against internal violence of spirit, including the impulse to humiliate our opponents. Activists underwent rigorous training to ensure theyd remain poised.</p><p>Many of todays loudest progressives delight in humiliating their opponents, certain that they occupy the moral high ground even as they use the GOPs tone and tactics. Ive been there. I know the cheap points to be scored by shaming Republicans as a mass of fascists and neo-Nazis.</p><p>Vilification sells books, gets clicks, goes viral and turns ordinary Americans against one another. Ultimately, regardless of which side youre arguing, stoking division with hate only props up the status quo.</p><p>Its worth remembering that people on the other side are less extreme than we think; the public face of politics  on TV and Twitter  <a href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/polarization-is-not-the-problem">doesnt represent</a> the larger public, but its most fanatical parts.</p><p>When I called Aslan after our panel, he told me that when he referred to the other side, he was thinking of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and her ilk, not the ordinary people manipulated by them. He believes many who fall for Greenes paranoid narratives can be transformed through pop culture that humanizes their imagined enemies. The solution is getting to know the other: in real life, or even on TV.</p><p>I love the idea. But I wouldnt count on Hollywood to solve things, given its <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/hollywood-gun-violence-report-norman-lear-center-1235376350/">obsession with violence</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-diversity-report-2023-34b8d7204f5b956494fbe4649e3acad6">lack of racial diversity.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Its going to take all of us. We must rekindle our faith in the humanity of our foes, and build relationships. We must recall that Kings nonviolent actions werent passive. They werent virtue signaling. They were arduously physical and dangerous. They cost King his life.</p><p>We must <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-18/essay-martin-luther-king-day-should-make-you-uncomfortable">revive his ideas</a> and salvage his dream. We need to have brave, empathetic, in-person confrontations with the other side. Thats how we <a href="https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html">wage love</a>. If we interpret polarization as a sign that the other side isnt worth our time, theres no hope for transformation.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jeanguerre?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@jeanguerre</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Haley and most of the other contenders have similarly endearing assumptions that base voters prioritize policy or positivity about America and the future.</p><p>Even Vivek Ramaswamy, who <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-6-4-23-vivek-ramaswamy-rep/story?id=99814403">appeared on ABCs This Week</a> to trot out the insipid and insidious idea that America should hand Russia a military victory, nonetheless works on the assumption that appealing to ideas is a winning strategy.</p><p>It reminds me of the old story about Adlai Stevensons remark about running for president in the 1950s. When told, Every thinking person in America will be voting for you. Stevenson reportedly replied, I'm afraid that won't do  I need a majority.</p><p>It's not that Trump voters dont care about ideas  good or bad  or even winning. The problem is their emotional attachment to Trump, an attachment that virtually all of his opponents let fester and harden for years. The result is a deeply ingrained and even more deeply debased conception of leadership and masculinity, one that confuses boorishness for winning.</p><p>Mike Pence, who filed the paperwork for his presidential bid on Monday, is a case in point. As Trumps vice president, Pence loyally defended his boss asininity for four years  until he hit the breaking point on Jan. 6, 2021. He nobly did the right thing that day, but even when it comes to Trumps effort to steal the election  which torched Americas ability to boast about the peaceful transfer of power  his tone has been more in sorrow than in anger.</p><p>Politicians are understandably reluctant to tell voters theyre wrong. But hinting at their wrongness isnt very effective, either. It </p>gets  is<p> translated as deference to a high school bully and thats disastrous for any candidate trying to seem like a leader.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JonahDispatch?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@JonahDispatch</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

And while they concern the details of an already obviously powerful case of obstruction and other charges against Donald Trump in the federal classified documents case, they underscore the impression that the case Smith is preparing will be overwhelming.</p><p>The latest revelations about the investigation go to the epicenter of the factual case for obstruction of justice and to the heart of Trumps anticipated defenses.</p><p>We learned Tuesday that Trump lawyer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/30/evan-corcoran-trump-lawyer-waved-off-secret-document-search?CMP=share_btn_tw">Evan Corcoran</a> testified to a federal grand jury that he was waved off searching Trumps office while attempting to comply with a subpoena for all classified documents in the former presidents possession. The instruction kept Corcoran from finding more than 100 classified documents that the FBI later seized in a court-ordered search, some of them in the office.</p><p>Corcorans testimony some weeks ago indicated that he was therefore materially misled when he was steered away from Trumps office, the Guardian reported.</p><p>But by whom? That is the screaming question that the report leaves unanswered.</p><p>You can bet, however, that Smith has an answer. The passive voice  was waved off, was materially misled  represents the limits of the reporting, not of the testimony. Corcoran, who is recused from the case as Trumps attorney and must be careful to avoid </p>getting  being<p> ensnared in the same net as his former client, was surely pressed on who exactly waved him off.</p><p>And regardless of whether</p> or not<p> the message was delivered by one or another Trump aide, it is quite likely that the command can be traced to the ex-president. Who else would have the authority to issue such an instruction?</p><p>This is potentially the crux of the obstruction case, the moment when Team Trump  and </p>likely  probably<p> Trump himself  broke the law by deciding not to comply with the subpoena and lie about it.</p><p>The partial report of Corcorans testimony presages a much more detailed and damning account at trial. It will be augmented by the attorneys 50 pages of contemporaneous notes, which a court has already ruled are probable evidence of criminal conduct by Trump. Corcoran is likely to testify that (a) he told Trump he could not retain any documents with classified markings and (b) he understood that Trump himself had instructed that he need not look in the former presidents office.</p><p>Coming from the mouth of Trumps own lawyer, thats killer testimony.</p><p>Yet another revelation came Wednesday, when CNN reported the existence of an audio recording of a 2021 meeting in which Trump acknowledges that he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/31/politics/trump-tape-classified-document-iran-milley/index.html">retained a classified document</a> about a potential attack on Iran. Equally important, he is heard suggesting that he cant legally share the information with the people he was talking to.</p><p>Such a recording would demolish the far-fetched defense Trump has trotted out in public to the effect that he had untrammeled authority to declassify any documents he took. On the contrary, he reportedly admits on the recording that he has classified documents that cant be legally disseminated  refuting any claim that they were automatically declassified by his having taken them.</p><p>The Guardian also reported that Trump says on the recording that he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/31/donald-trump-classified-military-document-recording-iran">should have declassified the document</a>, further undermining Trumps claimed powers of automatic declassification.</p><p>Even if Trump was really waving a blank piece of paper at his interlocutors and only pretending it was a classified document, as some commentators have suggested, his own words would demonstrate his awareness of the legal limits.</p><p>Team Trump has offered no response to the merits of any of these reports. It has only assailed them as selective leaks from the government, which seems unlikely. That would be a serious and risky transgression by a prosecutor known for playing by the book, and it would accomplish little for the special counsel at this late stage of the case. The accounts read more as if they came from witnesses or people they have spoken to, which is one reason they are incomplete.</p><p>The leak accusation is a pale distraction from the bottom line of the reports: that the grand jury heard compelling evidence that the former president probably orchestrated the failure to comply with the subpoena and knew his claims of plenary authority over classified documents were bunk.</p>Harry Litman is the host of the&nbsp;<p><a href="https://www.talkingfeds.com/">Talking Feds podcast</a></p>.&nbsp;<p><a href="https://twitter.com/harrylitman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@harrylitman</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

What, on a personal level, to do? </p><p>Having performed emission calculations for countless friends over the years, I can say confidently that failing the wherewithal to buy an electric car or go solar at your home, the biggest steps one can take to reduce their emissions are to reduce their consumerism, and to for</p>e<p>go a plane trip or two in favor of a car or, better yet, train. </p><p>Among the 18-20 tons of carbon dioxide expelled annually by the average American (still five times that of the average Latin American), those two behaviors typically account for a vastly outsized portion. Address them, and you can often lower your own emissions by 20%. </p><p>Finally, while the Inflation Reduction Act was a laudable first big step toward addressing the climate crisis, economists and scientists agree that a meaningful carbon fee applied throughout the economy would be the fastest and most dramatic mitigating measure on hand.</p>Jordan Sollitto, San Marino<p>..</p><p><b>To the editor:</b> The levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere are at their highest level yet, so we must reduce emissions as fast as possible. A low-carbon electric power sector will be the backbone of a low-carbon economy. </p><p>Right now, the United States does not have any legal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Fortunately, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working on regulations to limit them. This is a major step forward. </p><p>These regulations should be strengthened in the following ways: They must include small gas power plants, and they must mandate at least a 90% reduction in emissions for all gas and coal power plants by 2030. </p><p>This is necessary if we are to meet our target of cutting emissions in half by 2030.</p>Narayan Gopinathan, Los AngelesThe writer is a doctoral student at UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability.<p>..</p><p><b>To the editor:</b> There's a disconnect in how the world deals with the climate crisis. </p><p>The concentration of carbon dioxide from burning coal, oil and natural gas are at levels unseen in human civilization. As a result, our planet is over-heating, and the impacts are devastating. </p><p>At the same time, clean, affordable alternatives like solar and wind power are increasingly available and promise huge benefits.</p><p>Why are we not transitioning more quickly to clean energy? Follow the money. Fossil fuel companies have a lot to lose. </p><p>The market value of fossil fuel reserves is trillions of dollars. To achieve climate goals, almost all coal and most gas and oil must stay in the ground. </p><p>Lets demand that our elected officials begin now to phase</p>-<p> out fossil fuels before its too late.</p>Robert Taylor, Santa Barbara                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The digital revolution </p> has have already <p>significantly changed the business model, particularly for television shows. The <a href="https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/wga-ai-writers-strike-technology-ban-1235610076/" target="_blank">arrival of artificial intelligence</a> could upend things again, if software takes over acting and writing work.</p><p>Writers and actors see their careers at stake and </p>, so far, <p>have been steadfast in demanding contract terms that protect their income</p>s<p> and ensure that there are </p>still<p> good jobs for the next generation of creators and performers. Media companies are also still learning to navigate </p>in<p> the world of streaming. After going on a spending spree in recent years to launch </p>their<p> services with prestige shows and movies, <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/08/streaming-trouble-hbo-max-netflix.html" target="_blank">few companies have managed to turn a profit</a> on streaming </p>yet<p> and are under pressure from </p> shareholders Wall Street <p>to cut costs and figure out a business model that works.</p><p>Negotiations begin Wednesday between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Discovery-Warner, NBC Universal and Sony. The Directors Guild of America <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-04/directors-guild-contract-studios-writers-strike-hollywood-labor">reached a deal</a> with the alliance over the weekend, with increased pay and streaming compensation.</p><p>The Writers Guild of America and the studios have not returned to the bargaining table since the strike started </p> May 2<p>, which is disappointing considering how much is at stake for the industry and the people who rely on </p> it the industry<p> for their livelihood.</p><p>There has</p>s already<p> been a slowdown in local production since the writers' strike began</p> May 2<p>. Normally, dozens of scripted television shows would be filming at this time of </p>the<p> year, according to FilmLA, which handles </p>film<p> permits for the city and county. Instead, just one </p>such <p>TV series had a permit last week, and the agency couldnt say whether the production was underway. Late-night talk shows have gone dark, as </p> have well asmany other <p>TV and some film productions across the country.</p><p>If SAG-AFTRA cant reach an agreement with the studios by June 30, the second strike will shut down the industry, possibly for months. </p><p>The Writers Guild represents 11,000 writers for film and television. SAG-AFTRA represents 160,000 performers and broadcasters. But thousands more will be out of work: camera operators, set decorators, production assistants and </p>many<p> others who work on set</p> s<p>.</p><p>The financial pain </p>also<p> will </p>be <p>reach beyond those directly employed in the industry</p>, too<p>. The 100-day writers' strike in 2007-08 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-jun-06-fi-writers6-story.html">cost the local economy</a> an estimated $2.1 billion and </p>some<p> 37,700 jobs, according to a Milken Institute analysis.</p><p>Like the Writers Guild,</p>  SAG-AFTRAthe actors union <p>argues that the</p> industry's<p> move to streaming has hurt performers income by paying less in residuals (fees for re-aired shows) than traditional broadcast</p> ing television shows<p>. The streaming model has also made it harder for writers and actors to maintain stable </p>good paying<p> work</p>  with solid pay<p>. </p>The<p> Streaming series typically have fewer episodes than broadcast </p> showsversions<p>, hire fewer writers, dismiss most writers when shooting begins and schedule long hiatuses between seasons. These changes make it increasingly difficult for our members to achieve and maintain a middle-class lifestyle working as a performer, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-strike-authorization-vote" target="_blank">according to SAG-AFTRA</a>.</p><p>The actors union has </p>its own<p> unique issues, </p>as well, <p>including seeking new rules and limits on self-taped auditions</p> , when actors have to prepare, stage and film their own auditions rather than attend an in-person audition<p>. Actors say </p>the practice  of having them stage and film their auditions, rather than appearing in person<p>  </p>which a practice that <p>took off during the </p> COVID-19 <p>pandemic  saddles them with extra labor and expenses for which they are not </p> compensated.paid.<p>Both unions are pushing for rules on the use of AI, including guardrails against replacing human contributions and </p> ensured to ensure <p>compensation if their work or likeness is used. So far, the studios have balked at including </p> such<p> language in the contracts. </p><p>No one can say </p>yet<p> whether AI could </p>ever <p>replace writers and actors o</p>. O<p>r </p>whether it <p>will just replace some tasks and complement creators work. This fight </p> won't be isnt <p>easily resolved when the technology is so quickly evolving. Nevertheless, </p>both<p> the unions and studios should be at the negotiating table  along with AI experts  to come up with a reasonable framework that provides basic protections in these early days.</p><p>The sooner all sides get into serious negotiations to protect the creators, the performers and the long-term viability of the industry, the better it will be for everyone. Hollywood doesn't need one strike  much less two  </p>that disrupts disrupting <p>lives and the L.A. economy.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The decision in Allen vs. Milligan is most significant for what the court didn’t do: It did not further weaken the law of voting rights as many expected.</description>

This was a surprising and important 5-4 victory for voting rights, with Chief Justice John</p>  G.<p> Roberts</p>  Jr.<p> writing the majority opinion, joined by Justice Brett </p> M. <p>Kavanaugh and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.</p><p>The decision in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/merrill-v-milligan-2/">Allen vs. Milligan</a> now requires Alabama to redraw its election map to create another district that likely would allow Black voters to elect a favored candidate.</p><p>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is one of the most crucial civil rights statutes adopted in American history. Ever since Reconstruction, especially in Southern states, there has been pervasive discrimination to keep Black Americans from registering and voting. For example, in Mississippi, in 1962, <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/freedom-summer">less than 7%</a> of the state's eligible Black voters were registered to vote.</p><p>The Voting Rights Act had two key provisions to remedy race discrimination in voting. Section 5 provided that jurisdictions with a history of race discrimination in voting would need to get pre</p> -<p>clearance from the United States </p>A a<p>ttorney </p>G g<p>eneral before making a change in their election systems. This was very effective in preventing discriminatory laws from going into effect.</p><p>But in June 2013, in Shelby County vs. Holder, the court declared unconstitutional the pre</p> -<p>clearance provisions of the law. Almost immediately, states</p>,<p> such as North Carolina and Texas</p>,<p> put into effect laws that had been denied pre</p> -<p>clearance because of their discriminatory effects. A crucial mechanism for stopping race discrimination in voting was nullified.</p><p>The other key provision of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, prevents state and local governments from having election systems that discriminate against voters of color. In 1982, Congress amended this to make clear that the law prohibits laws that have a discriminatory effect against minority voters; there does not have to be proof that the government had a racially discriminatory purpose.</p><p>But two years ago, in Brnovich vs. Democratic National Committee, the court made it much harder to use Section 2 to challenge state and local election laws that regulate voting  such as rules on absentee ballots and the location of polling places. In an ideologically split decision, the court made it very difficult to prove a racially discriminatory effect and also said that there must be consideration of the states interest in preventing voter fraud, something never mentioned in the Voting Rights Act.</p><p>It is against this backdrop that Thursdays decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_1co6.pdf">Allen v     s  . Milligan</a> is most significant for what the court didnt do: It did not further weaken the law of voting rights as many expected.</p><p>Alabamas population is about 27% Black. Alabama has seven seats in the House of Representatives. After the 2020 census, the Alabama legislature in redistricting packed Black voters into one of the seven districts and spread them around the others, with the effect that Alabama was very likely to have only one Black representative in Congress.</p><p>The Supreme Court, following decades-old precedents, found that this violated the Voting Rights Act. In 1986, the court articulated a test for determining when election districting is racially discriminatory. Under that test, to </p>a <p>prove a violation of the law, voters of color must demonstrate that they are large enough as a group to constitute the majority of a district, that they are politically cohesive, and that white voters in the proposed districting map would be likely to defeat candidates preferred by the voters of color.</p><p>Many analysts, including me, predicted that the court would use the Alabama case to weaken or overrule this test. This seemed likely because last year the court intervened in this case to allow the discriminatory map to be used in the 2022 primary and general elections in Alabama. After a three-judge federal court found it to be discriminatory and ordered a new map for congressional districts for the 2022 elections, the Supreme Court stepped in and issued a controversial order halting that ruling and granting review in the case.</p><p>But contrary to these predictions, Roberts majority opinion applied the 1986 test and found that Alabama violated the Voting Rights Act. Quite significantly, the court rejected Alabamas contention that it was impermissible to consider race at all in evaluating whether election districts violate the law. If the court had accepted that argument, the implications for other civil rights laws would have been grave. That would have meant that discrimination in housing or employment could no longer be proved by showing racially discriminatory consequences.</p><p>Instead, the court said, The contention that mapmakers must be entirely blind to race has no footing in our 2 case law. Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, made the radical claim that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does not apply to race discrimination in districting at all, a position that would allow governments to discriminate against minority voters with impunity in drawing election districts for Congress, state legislatures and local councils.</p><p>Its a relief that the decision does not change the law or further eviscerate protection for voting rights. Indeed, given the Supreme Courts recent history, its following precedent and finding a violation of the Voting Rights Act is practically a cause for celebration.</p>Erwin Chemerinsky is a contributing writer to Opinion and the dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law.

This movie puts a Latino  Richard Montaez, played by Jesse Garcia  front and center. While this may not seem like a radical act, only 4% of the 1,600 most popular movies from 2007 to 2022 featured a Latino in the lead.</p><p>"Flamin Hot" does more than just defy the odds on screen. Behind the scenes, this film about snack foods shatters other conventions. Among the 1,600 top-grossing films from the last 16 years, only one out of every 320 had a Latina director. Only one was directed by a Mexican</p>-<p> American woman. In other words, youre more likely to <a href="https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds">know a person hit by lightning</a> or to be <a href="https://www.medicaldaily.com/leap-year-psychological-effects-375317">born on Feb. 29</a> than to see a top-grossing film with someone like Eva Longoria  yes, the actor-producer-director Eva Longoria  at the helm.</p><p>It isnt just the director either. </p> A mere 3% percent of all casting directors in top-grossing films are Latinos.  and fewer than 10 Latinas have received credit as screenwriters of top-grossing movies.<p> From the top of the call sheet to the last credit to roll, the composition of the cast and crew on "Flamin Hot" is an anomaly.</p><p>The Latino community has a rich history and strong cultural impact in this country, but you wouldn't know it by watching movies. "Flamin Hot" takes direct aim at the lack of Latinos in film and the persistent stereotyping they face. It puts businessman Montaez at the center of the story and surrounds him with Latino family and friends. Given <a href="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-hispanic-latino-rep-2021-09-13.pdf">that our research shows that 50% of Latino main characters are isolated on screen</a>, the film provides an important lens on Latino family and community life. The movie also showcases key aspects of Latino culture  food, faith, clothing, relationships  that are often absent from popular movies.</p><p>Hollywood is often quick to tell stories of the Latino as an outsider, someone who wasn't born in this country and doesnt have a say in shaping American values. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/23/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/">Although the majority of the U.S. Hispanic/Latino population is born in the U.S.</a>, only about <a href="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-hispanic-latino-rep-2021-09-13.pdf">one-third of the Hispanic/Latino characters we examined in 2019</a> were Latinos born in the U.S. "Flamin Hot" has no time for such myths: The Latinos at the core of this story are fully American and fully Mexican, and as the characters demonstrate, this means they have </p> an advantage  superpower &lt;&lt;another word?<p> that often goes overlooked.</p><p>Just as "Flamin Hot" Cheetos revealed that the Latino market is a powerful force to drive consumer behavior  even outside the community  so too can "Flamin Hot" serve as a call to action for Hollywood. First, we need more Latino stories brought to the screen. These stories exist and are waiting to be told. Similarly, the talent is there; the people who brought "Flamin Hot" to the screen represent a much larger community of talented Latinos who are ready to be hired for stories that should feature Latinos.</p><p>The rest of the industry has a role to play as well. Talent agencies must recruit and sign more talent and push for their clients to appear in more stories. Casting directors should commit to casting processes that ensure Latino actors are auditioned and cast in greater numbers. Film festivals, nonprofits and philanthropists can designate funding and create initiatives to support and accelerate the work of Latino filmmakers.</p><p>Corporations  even those outside of the entertainment industry  can ensure that their marketing and promotional efforts support Latinos. For example, McDonalds created the <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/our-stories/article/spotlight-dorado.html">Spotlight Dorado program</a> to provide funding for Latino filmmakers and mentorship opportunities. As "Flamin Hot" so clearly demonstrates, corporations ignore Latinos</p>  to their own detriment.at their own peril.<p>The Latino market for snacks was all but ignored until decision-makers were reminded about the power of this consumer group. The irony that a movie should make this point is not lost on us. Despite the <a href="https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MPA-2021-THEME-Report-FINAL.pdf">reliability of Latino audiences</a> <a href="https://www.motionpictures.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MPA-THEME-2019.pdf">to show up at the multiplex</a>, Latinos are rarely (if ever) the focus of or the creative force behind top films. This must change.</p><p>The entertainment industry should learn from this movie and continue to serve the Latino community with stories that authentically represent this audience, told by storytellers who identify as Latino. As this new film shows us, theres no limit to the number of products that can be made Flamin Hot  and there should be no limit on the number of Latino stories, either.</p><p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/personnel/ariana-case">Ariana Case</a></p>&nbsp;is the program manager and&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/personnel/katherine-pieper">Katherine Pieper</a></p>&nbsp;is the program director of the USC&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/research/aii">Annenberg Inclusion Initiative</a></p>, founded by&nbsp;<p><a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/stacy-l-smith">Stacy L.

The publishers, in turn, would have to spend at least 70% of the fees they receive on journalists or support staff. The money would come out of the platforms advertising revenue and the amount would be determined by arbitration.</p><p>The bill now goes before the state Senate. By passing the law, California would be just one of many jurisdictions looking to emulate <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/digital-platforms-and-services/news-media-bargaining-code/news-media-bargaining-code#:~:text=The%20Treasury%20Laws%20Amendment%20(News,a%20significant%20bargaining%20power%20imbalance.">Australias&nbsp;News Media Bargaining Code</a>, developed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which became law in 2021. <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/google-canada-tells-senate-bill-c-18-would-create-unreasonable-financial-liability-1.6383265?cache=lbaijlxg%3FcontactForm%3Dtrue">Canadas equivalent</a> will </p>likely  probably<p> become law in a few months and now governments in Britain, Brazil, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Africa and Switzerland are all considering similar laws.</p><p>Around the world, many journalism outlets are in crisis with advertising revenue plummeting while Google and Meta use </p> theirthat<p> news content to attract users  and advertising dollars  without paying for it. Attempts by media companies to receive some payment for their work have gone nowhere for years. Australias groundbreaking law directly addresses this bargaining power imbalance.</p><p>We now have two years of Australian experience to learn from. The estimated payout to Australian publishers <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2022/australias-news-media-bargaining-code-pries-140-million-from-google-and-facebook/">has been well over $140 million</a> each year, with both small and large media organizations benefiting from that revenue source. Google has formed commercial arrangements with virtually all qualifying media outlets, while Meta has completed deals with outlets employing some 85% of Australian journalists.</p><p>A <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/review/news-media-digital-platforms-mandatory-bargaining-code">review of the news bargaining code</a> by the Australian Treasury department in late 2022 deemed the code a success. Hundreds of new jobs have been created, with employment data showing a 46% increase in job ads for journalists. For example</p>, <p>the Guardian Australia</p> <p>added 50 journalists, bringing its newsroom total to 150. Journalism professors also say that more of </p> ?<p> their students are </p>getting  being<p> hired and </p>that<p> some job vacancies are going unfilled.</p><p>Opponents of the Australian law argued that most of the money </p> wouldwill<p> go to the largest media outlets. That is, of course, true since those organizations employ the most journalists and produce the most news used by Google and Meta. But small media groups have benefited enormously from the law, just as small media groups </p>will  would<p> in California. Country Press Australia, which represents 160 very small publications, has been able to negotiate excellent deals for its </p>their<p> members with both Google and Meta, which will help underwrite their prosperity.</p><p>Another argument put forward by opponents is that Google and Meta do not always advertise against media content. That is not the point; media content attracts users to the platforms where they can see advertisements.</p><p>Google search would be far less useful if it did not offer </p>to<p> users access to media content ranging from the best new movies to court cases to COVID-19. By showing the headline and a few lines of news in Google search, Google skims off the most valuable part of the news without sharing the monetary benefits with news outlets. And imagine how much less useful your daily Facebook feed would be with no journalist-produced news content at all.</p><p>Opponents of the law have also argued that it could benefit media organizations that traffic in misinformation or biased reporting. But laws should not choose one outlet over another. Australia has four large media companies, many medium-sized companies and a huge number of smaller media outlets. They all benefited from deals with Google and nearly all benefited from Meta deals. Journalism as a whole was the winner.</p><p>Meta has threatened to block all news from Facebook if the California law passes, just as it did in Australia for a week before backing down. Facebook <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-56099523">blocked Australian news</a> in early 2021 during the COVID pandemic and bush fire season, which prevented potentially lifesaving news getting out. The popular backlash against Facebook was swift.</p><p>This is a critical time for journalism. News organizations are struggling to stay alive while huge internet platforms </p> thatwho<p> benefit financially from journalism are freeloading from content providers. This imbalance is a serious threat to information in any free society.</p><p>The California Journalism Preservation Act, like the Australian law, is a vital piece of legislation that will help keep journalism sustainable.</p>Rod Sims, a professor at Australian National University, was chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission when the News Media Bargaining Code was being formulated and enacted.
