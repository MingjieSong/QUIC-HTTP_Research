The show includes 20 new paintings and graffitid works on paper, as well as an updated, hand-painted mini-sculpture of his signature cat character, Bronson, and one of his vintage custom art cars, The Gangster Squad. Beyond the Streets Publishing is also releasing a new book of 290 drawings, over two decades, that traces the evolution of Mister Cartoons designs.</p> L.A.'s 'cholo Da Vincis' brought Chicano culture to the boardroom. Now they have a Netflix doc<p>On a recent tour of the exhibition as it was being installed, Mister Cartoon  </p>A.K.A.  a.k.a.<p> Mark Machado, or Cartoon, as hes often referred to  appeared humbled by the imminent opening, which he says has been a long time coming.</p><p>Its living up to where people think youre at, because Ive been in so many exhibitions, he says. I want to show people, through my art, what kind of music Im interested in, my passion for and obsession with cars and automotive, taking peoples tattoos and peeling them off and putting them on the canvas, taking a mural off of a [Chevrolet] Impala and putting it on a canvas. Its a huge moment, I dont take it for granted.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e3/ce/82d27fc14447bac882e9242acc00/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-011.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2011-apr-02-la-hm-roger-gastman-20110402-story.html">Roger Gastman</a>, who co-curated the Museum of Contemporary Arts 2011 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/culture-monster-blog/story/2011-04-15/art-review-art-in-the-streets-at-the-geffen-contemporary-at-moca">Art in the Streets</a> exhibition, had included Cartoon in three iterations of his<b> </b>traveling exhibition spotlighting graffiti and street artists, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-spring-preview-roger-gastman-20180325-htmlstory.html">Beyond the Streets.</a> The two had been talking about Cartoon doing a solo show for years.</p><p>The challenge was time. Cartoons popularity in the tattoo community and his commercial success as a<b> </b>graphic designer and in the fashion industry had, in a sense, hampered his</p> <p>ability to move forward as a fine artist  he didnt have time to take a step back and create the large body of work needed for a solo show.</p><p>Hes been busy, Gastman says. Hes one of the most sought-after tattoo artists, sought after as a painter and designer of cars, for commercial work and everything else. Being able to sit down for six months and make paintings is not something thats been easy for him to do. Hes never made this many paintings [at once] before. For this show, it was: Lets go for it. Lets do the big show. Tell the stories that have been in your head forever.</p><p>The exhibition was hatched when, in 2022, Beyond the Streets opened a flagship <a href="https://beyondthestreets.com/" target="_blank">bricks-and-mortar space</a> on La Brea </p>Ave.  Avenue<p> along with the adjacent <a href="https://control.gallery/" target="_blank">Control Gallery</a> to showcase contemporary art. Gastman sometimes uses the two outlets for related programming, and Cartoons exhibition will fill both galleries <b> </b>a total takeover, Gastman says.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b2/74/a4a668fc4549ba2c831850f59c34/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-009.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2020-04-10/netflix-mister-cartoon-estevan-oriol-la-originals">Cartoon</a>, 54, spent half a year creating art for the show, working in his home studio<b> </b>in the San Fernando Valley<b> </b>that he shares with two of his four children. </p>Despite being comprised Though consisting<p> of new work, the show has the feel of a survey exhibition given its scope. It touches on Cartoons roots as a graffiti artist, his foray into sign painting, his passion for lowrider custom-car culture and the years, in the early 90s, on the road<b> </b>with his creative partner, photographer and director <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-05-14/la-et-lowrider-moments-in-film-television">Estevan Oriol</a>, immersed in the </p>hip hop hip-hop<p> scene. Not to mention his pivot to tattoo art at the time, a game-changer for his career that elevated his presence as an artist.</p><p>Stepping away from the grind of commercial work and clients, he says, I was able to paint for me and my peers and my family. The freedom has been very special, a time for self</p> -<p>refection: </p> W<p>hat do I want to say on my platform? Who am I as an artist? How can I take 30 years and put it into a couple of rooms, show my evolution?</p><p>The answer, Cartoon says, was an exhibition he describes as a collage of my memories and fantasies.</p><p>The show is especially personal. At its heart, its about relationships  between Cartoon and his family, friends and tattoo clients throughout the years, but also his relationship to music and cars and art as well as, more generally, humans relationships to work and death. Characters appear repeatedly in the paintings, amalgams of figures in Cartoons life. His tattoo designs show up on their body parts and appear around the gallery. Vintage cars hes owned populate the canvases.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4a/1b/74674efd4cb98ff94e4560dede00/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-010.jpg"></figure><p>Cars saved Cartoons life, he says. Growing up in a working-class family, in the 70s and 80s</p> , he recalls his parents worked all the time" at the print shop they owned. <p>I hung out with the homies on the street," he says. "We started writing on walls and terrorizing a bit. I saw friends get incarcerated or pass away due to street life, and that definitely pushed me into the car world. It was a way to still be cool with the fellas, but not gangster activities.</p><p>All the work<b> </b>in the show is made with automotive paint and using the technique of airbrush painting. Cartoon tattoos in the black and gray <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-tattoo-show-nhm-20171126-story.html">fine-line style</a><b> </b></p>that<p> developed in prisons in the West and on the streets of East L.A. in the 70s.<b> </b>As such, most of his paintings on canvas<b> </b>are rendered in black, white and gray tones. But three paintings in the show<b> </b> inspired by cars  stand in sharp contrast. Glossy, bursting with color and framed with shimmering, delicate line work, theyre painted on sloping pieces of hand-hammered aluminum that mimic the look of car hoods. The works are especially labor intensive, repeatedly sanded, primed and painted, then sealed. The curved metal and high gloss surface create reflections that lend the works an almost three-dimensional quality.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/9d/c849ebb34c78a9a7ad8a3edb8a06/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-013.jpg"></figure><p>Clouds, a recurring theme in Cartoons work over the decades, factor in heavily. His cityscapes appear under skies blanketed with stormy or pillowy clouds. Other canvases, filled to the edges with clouds alone, contain hidden faces  Easter eggs  in the nooks and shadows.</p><p>When I started traveling, Id look out the window of an airplane, just looking up at the sky, and they just always seemed so innocent, Cartoon says of clouds. They look like paintings to me. Ive been drawing them since I was a kid. Theyre free form and always flowing, moving. Its that dream state.</p><p>Cartoons fantasies in some of the paintings are as vibrant as his memories of real-life experiences  often more so, he says. One painting on aluminum depicts Mexican Marilyn Monroe <b> </b>Mariposa  and El Vez, he says. Bathed in aqua and cobalt, the characters rise out of a 57 Chevy Bel Air convertible. The image captures Cartoons affection for the glamorous, noirish 1940s and 1950s.</p><p>My father grew up then, he says. I think I spent a lot of my life fantasizing about living in that era and buying all the cars at the dealership. Go back in my time machine to 1959: Hey, how much for that used 57 convertible? $1,200</p> dollars<p>, you say? O</p> K<p>, wrap it up. Ill take three. This is the American dream. In this case, the Mexican American dream.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/4f/47/72c9be624b1fb77bed9368c36b4e/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-012.jpg"></figure><p>Cartoon listens to classic soul music from the 60s and 70s when he paints  hence, the title of the exhibition, from a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-12-15/aint-too-proud-otis-williams-temptations-ahmanson-la">Temptations</a> song  and music<b> </b>from those eras will play in the background in the galleries.</p><p>There will also be a large-scale tattoo station installation on view, filled with Cartoons hand-painted signs, an ode to his history in the medium and still-active tattoo shop in<b> </b>Santa Monica.<b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>This is where my canvas is breathing and walking around, he says. It could end up in a plane or in a casket, or get married or go to Austria. The tattoos travel.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/24/0e/327b7d504cd0a2c79cb9cdeaeabc/1306146-et-mr-cartoon-006.jpg"></figure><p>Cartoon leans against his 1939 Chevy Master Deluxe parked inside the gallery. Its glossy midnight blue. It has a broad, proud nose "with the attitude of Al Capone,"<b> </b>he says, and it features a mural of gangsters on both sides and the trunk.</p><p>Im a storyteller, Cartoon says. This show, its the story of good times and bad times, the yin and yang of life, positives and negatives, the struggle and the joy and the build of it all.</p><p>In the 80s and 90s, he adds, he witnessed the collision of emerging hip hop, tattoo culture, street art and street fashion as well as evolving lowrider car culture and the growing<b> </b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-15/always-a-collector-cheech-marin-brings-his-art-to-riverside">Chicano art movement</a><b> </b><b> </b>all of which are storylines in the show.</p><p>I was told back then to find your part. How are you gonna contribute to this cultural movement?  he says. I tried breaking, I tried DJing and I decided I can draw better than I can dance. So I better stick with that.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Per the suit, at no point did Allen disclose that he was planning to film their sexual encounter. While Jane Doe 2 states she did consent to sex, she alleges she repeatedly informed Allen that she was not on birth control</p>,<p> and asked him to please </p>use the pull-out pull out during intercourse method<p>, which she states he agreed to. </p><p>As the </p> alleged<p> sexual encounter transpired, she asked </p>again for <p>Allen </p> again <p>to pull </p>-<p>out but </p> says alleges <p>that he refused, told her he wanted to get her pregnant and ejaculated inside of her against her will.

Upon returning home, she took Allens phone to her local police department and reported the assault and the surreptitious recording. </p><p>The local police department told her they would report the incident to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.</p> Allens attorney did not immediately respond to The Times request for comment regarding the second lawsuit filed Friday.<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-11/jimmie-allen-sued-for-alleged-sexual-assault-sex-trafficking">Allen denied any wrongdoing</a> when The Times reached out for comment regarding the first lawsuit filed by his former manager.</p><p>It is deeply troubling and hurtful that someone I counted as one of my closest friends, colleagues and confidants would make allegations that have no truth to them whatsoever, Allen told The Times. I acknowledge that we had a sexual relationship  one that lasted for nearly two years. During that time, she never once accused me of any wrongdoing, and she spoke of our relationship and friendship as being something she wanted to continue indefinitely.</p> " Allen said that his manager hired a lawyer to reach out for money after things ended between them, which led him to question her motives.The simple fact is, her accusations are not only false, but also extremely damaging ," he added. "Ive worked incredibly hard to build my career, and I intend to mount a vigorous defense to her claims and take all other legal action necessary to protect my reputation. Elizabeth Fegan, the attorney representing both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, said "that is categorically not true," in a statement to The Times. Fegan also said that a payout was never requested; however, on Friday, she confirmed that both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 are seeking unspecified monetary damages in the lawsuits, which will be decided by the court<p>.</p>  The only ask we made of Allen and his legal counsel was to meet to discuss Allens behavior and resolution of our clients claims. At no time did our client make a monetary demand. The response was a hard no, and colored with threats that his team would take steps to publicly tarnish my client. My client had no choice but to be proactive in protecting herself by filing the complaint.Only after things ended between us, did she hire a lawyer to reach out and ask for money, which leads me to question her motives. The simple fact is, her accusations are not only false, but also extremely damaging. Ive worked incredibly hard to build my career, and I intend to mount a vigorous defense to her claims and take all other legal action necessary to protect my reputation.Allens attorney did not immediately respond to The Times request for comment regarding the second lawsuit filed Friday.moved upElizabeth Fegan, managing partner of Fegan Scott and the attorney representing both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 in  the two lawsuits ,litigation concerning Jimmie Allen told The Times that since  Since <p>Jane Doe filed her case last month,</p>  Fegan's law<p> firm has heard from others who share similar experiences </p> with Allen, she said<p>.</p> After sexual assault: A guide to the exams, your rights and your choices<p>Jane Doe 2s filing demonstrates to me that there is a vivid, distinct pattern of behavior. We intend to show its a pattern of deceit, manipulation, and ultimately of force, Fegan said </p> Friday in an email.<p> The law is clear  anyone who has given consent in sexual activity has the right and the ability to revoke consent at any time. Just as no means no, stop means stop. If one participant doesnt stop, it is sexual assault.</p>The attorney told <p><a href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/jimmie-allen-accused-sexual-assault-filming-sex-lawsuit-1235637548/" target="_blank">Variety</a></p> that after her first clients lawsuit was filed last month, she was contacted by Jill Doe, the friend that the woman had called after allegedly fleeing Allens suite in Las Vegas. The friend said she had seen the sexual assault allegations against Allen, and eventually, Jane Doe 2 agreed to come forward.A predator can only have two defenses: one is consent, and one is that it didnt happen, Fegan told Variety. The more women that come forward, the more they cant claim it didnt happen, and the less likely it is that its consensual. It shows a pattern of deceit, manipulation and ultimately, a pattern of force. <p>Allen, who auditioned for the 10th season of American Idol in 2011 but was cut before the live rounds, has been slowly climbing the country music ladder over the </p> l<p>ast decade. In 2021</p> ,<p> he won the CMA </p> Aa<p>ward for new artist of the year, the second Black artist ever to land the honor.</p><p>In April, Allen and wife Alexis Gale announced via social media that they were calling it quits after three years of marriage, but also revealed that Gale was pregnant with their third child. A week after the first </p> law<p>suit was filed</p> ,<p> Allen <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jimmie-allen-apology-wife-alexis-gale-affair-1235332347/" target="_blank">released a statement</a> on social media</p>, apologizing to his pregnant wife for addressing <p>what he called an "affair" and seemingly </p> blamingblamed <p>the </p> music<p> industry for his behavior. </p><p>I want to publicly apologize to my wife Alexis for humiliating her with my affair. Im embarrassed that my choices have brought shame on her. Thats something that she did not deserve at all, he </p> saidbegan<p>, adding that he wanted to apologize for being a poor example of a man to his children. </p><p>The business takes so much from you. Its full of temptations that can cripple you and ruin everything youve built. Im ashamed that I wasnt strong enough to withstand them. I will no longer be a victim of my weaknesses.</p><p>Fallout came swiftly for the Grammy-nominated country musician. </p> Aside from being dropped by his record label,   . In the last month, <p>he was </p>dropped from his label BBR Music, <p>terminated by his publicist, United Talent Agency severed ties </p> with him<p>, he was removed from </p> Sunday's the <p>CMA Fest lineup </p>for a June 11 performance <p>in Nashville and dropped as the commencement speaker at Delaware State Universitys graduation ceremony. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But writer-director <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mini-mohawk-review-20180302-story.html">Ted Geoghegan</a> packs in plenty of plot</p>. Geoghegan and <p>gives an excellent cast some flavorful dialogue and rich characters to play; </p>and <p>his crew supports them with a meticulously dressed set, a colorful visual palette, and some sparse but well-deployed visual effects. Most of what makes Brooklyn 45 so entertaining doesnt cost a lot of money. It just takes talent, and diligence.</p><p>The horror legend <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-04-14/review-jakobs-wife-barbara-crampton">Larry Fessenden</a> plays </p> Lt. Col.  Lieutenant Colonel<p> Clive Hock Hockstatter, who invites some old friends and Army buddies to his home a month after his wife Susan died. Hes joined by the ruthless military interrogator Marla Sheridan </p> (Anne Ramsay)<p> and her Pentagon pencil-pusher husband Bob</p>  (Ron E. Rains),<p> along with the gung-ho old soldier Major Paul DiFran</p> c<p>o (</p> Ezra Buzzington<p>) and the publicly disgraced Maj</p> .or<p> Archibald Stanton (</p> Jeremy Holm)<p>. Hock asks the party to join him in a seance, which gets interrupted by a shocking act of violence and the surprise arrival of a German immigrant neighbor, Hildy (</p> Kristina Klebe)<p>, who may be a Nazi spy.</p><p>Geoghegan structures Brooklyn 45 a lot like a stage play, where the characters reveal secrets about themselves over the course of one spooky evening  and where every 15 minutes the plot takes another surprising turn. Each actor gets a turn in the spotlight, and each makes the most of it, delivering little speeches about their characters wartime activities that subtly change the way the other people in the apartment see them. This movie is mostly an exercise in retro pulp</p> ,;<p> but its a well-made one </p> with , and it does have <p>some sharper points lurking beneath the old-fashioned style. At its prickliest, this is a film about </p>how  the ways <p>social niceties can mask deep distrust and dark pasts  which still have a way of surfacing eventually.</p>Brooklyn 45. Not rated. 1 hour, 32 minutes. Available on Shudder/AMC+Unidentified Objects<p>Two standout leading performances mitigate against some overwrought kookiness in Unidentified Objects, an indie dramedy tinged with science </p>-<p>fiction. Matthew August Jeffers plays Peter, a self-described college-educated homosexual dwarf, who spent the pandemic doing what he was inclined to do anyway: sitting alone in his New York apartment, reading Chekhov. </p> Sarah Hay <p>plays Peters neighbor Winona, </p> who refers to herself  self-described<p> as a human who does sex work. Sarah offers to help pay Peters overdue bills if he can help her get </p>her <p>to Canada, where she expects to be reunited with the extraterrestrials who abducted her as a teenager.</p><p>The trip involves Peter borrowing (or more accurately stealing) a car from an absent friend. On the way, the two encounter smugglers, cosplayers, violent goons and aliens  some of them real, and some merely figments of Peters constantly racing imagination. Directo</p> r Juan Felipe Zuleta <p>and screenwriter Leland Frankel get too cutesy with this blending of reality and fantasy</p> ,;<p> but they and their cast are spot </p>-<p>on with their depiction of Peter and Winonas shared desperation. They both have a lot riding on this journey, which theyve come to believe is their last chance to wring some meaning out of lives other people see as pitiable. Jeffers and Hay have a strong chemistry,</p>;<p> and they make Peter and Winonas vivacity and pain feel equally real, even when the movie around them is shading toward the phony.</p>Unidentified Objects. Not rated.&nbsp;1 hour, 40 minutes. Available on VOD; also screens theatrically June 14, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, downtown Los Angeles 4-1.jpgAloners<p>In </p>   Hong Sung-eun <p>s eerie drama Aloners, </p> Gong Seung-yeon<p> plays Jina, a seemingly serene young woman who lives by herself and avoids all but the most superficial human contact  a quality that makes her well-suited to her job at a credit card companys customer service call center. When Jinas boss asks her to train the 20-year-old Sujin (</p> Jung Da-eun<p>), the newcomers tendency to become emotionally involved with the customers flummoxes Jina, who prefers to be blankly polite and</p> to<p> end calls quickly.</p><p>Aloners is part character sketch and part cautionary tale, with a fairly predictable point to make about</p> how<p> people need</p> ing<p> people  even when our neighbors, co</p> -<p>workers, customers and parents are annoyingly demanding. But while the message is pat, the way its presented is poignant, thanks to an arresting lead performance from Gong, who manages a tricky balance of chilliness and charm. Hongs use of repetitive detail conveys how Jinas life can be equal parts comforting and confining. Its easy for Jina to eat at the same noodle shops and to watch the same streaming channels day after day  and to cut off any calls, texts or conversations that might disrupt that routine. But as she eventually learns: This may be a good way to survive, but its a terrible way to live.</p>Aloners. Not rated.&nbsp;1 hour, 30 minutes.

Set during the Holocaust, this inescapably oddball portrait of a transit camp supervisor whos led to believe hes being taught Farsi from a Persian prisoner whos actually Belgian Jew</p> ish<p>, relies heavily on a pair of strong performances </p> thatwhich<p> help to distract from lingering plot improbabilities.</p><p>The year is 1942</p> ,<p> and among those herded into a transport heading to Germany from Nazi-occupied France, is Gilles (Nahuel Prez Biscayart) a rabbis son from Antwerp who is persuaded by a hungry passenger to trade his sandwich for an old book that belonged to his landlord. Written in Persian, the book will prove to be a literal lifesaver for Gilles, who manages to stave off certain execution by claiming to be not a </p> JewJewish,<p> but a Persian named Reza Joon  the name that had been inscribed in its pages by Joons father.</p><p>As it just so happens, the transit camps commanding officer, Koch (Lars Eidinger) has put out the word out that hes looking for someone to teach him Farsi</p> ,<p> and while hes initially dubious about the new arrivals claims</p>,<p> he nevertheless proceeds to enlist his services. Its a precarious ruse at best, but even though his Farsis a farce, Reza industriously manages to invent enough gibberish to teach Koch several new words a day over the course of his internment, somehow avoiding tripping up  with one, near-tragic exception.</p><p>During those lessons, Koch gradually forms something of a fatherly bond with his captive, revealing his dreams of moving to Teh</p>e<p>ran after the war and opening up his own restaurant, while Reza takes advantage of his trust to help out his fellow prisoners.</p><p>Purportedly taking inspiration from accounts shared over the years, particularly the 1997 short story</p>,<p> Erfindung einer Sprache (Invention of a Language) by Wolfgang Kohlhaase, the script, originally penned in Russian by </p> Ilya Zofin<p>, struggles to overcome fundamental credibility issues. Problematic</p>,<p> too</p>,<p> is the decision to include plotlines involving the films less-compelling secondary characters, adding unnecessary weight to an already prolonged running time.</p><p>That it ultimately manages to work as effectively as it does is a credit to the firm, focused visual grip of director Perelman, best known for his Oscar-nominated 2003 drama, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-14-ca-olsen14-story.html">House of Sand and Fog,</a> and, especially the impressively-rooted portrayals of the two leads.</p><p>The slight Argentine actor Biscayart, who won a French Csar for playing an AIDS activist in 2017s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-bpm-review-20171102-story.html">BPM (Beats per Minute)</a></p> ,<p> conveys the haunted guilt of a man eking out an existence on borrowed time, in the process bringing out a shred of compassion in Eidingers duped Koch. Despite the obstacles, they succeed in bringing the film to an emotionally resonant conclusion, providing an unwavering through line in a survival story that cant help but feel like something may have been lost in translation.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Critics are complaining that their conservative taste is holding the American theater back. Actors, resuming their war on phones and hard candy now that masks are no longer required, are up in arms about bad etiquette. Patti LuPone has loudly <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/patti-lupone-not-retiring-broadway-1235408773/" target="_blank">lamented</a> the distracted, "dumbed down" audience </p> for Broadway, which she says is becoming more like "Disneyland, a circus and Las Vegas." <p>At the start of my theater trip to New York this spring  an exhausting eight-show itinerary in 5 </p>1/2 <p>days  I met my niece for a matinee of Life of Pi. It was pell-mell outside the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on W</p>. est<p> 45th St</p> reet<p>. Horns were blaring, crowds were swarming and security was shouting for ticket-holders to get in the right line.</p><p>I joked, in curmudgeon uncle fashion, that the worst part of my job is </p> sometimes <p>the public. But after my marathon of shows, I left town with enormous gratitude to my fellow theatergoers for </p>the sophisticated quality of<p> their </p> genuine <p>laughter, the seriousness of their attention, the generosity of their emotion and the graciousness of their applause.</p><p>Theater is both an art form and a marketplace, and Broadway ticket-buyers </p> have long been getting a raw deal.<p> Beyond the ludicrous cost of admission, the gouging at concessions, the transportation hell, the inadequate bathroom facilities and the torture-chamber seats, there's the general contempt thrown at theatergoers for not knowing what's good for them. </p><p>Attention must be paid to the core audience that has stuck it out and </p> been filling<p> these doddering old venues with their seasoned laughter and</p>  empathy.<p> The Tony Awards on Sunday really ought to add one more prize to the evenings roster  a special award to the stalwart Broadway theatergoer, without whom all of the years celebrated excellence would be as meaningless as the proverbial tree falling in a forest with no one around to hear it.</p> Commentary: The 2023 Tony Award nominations reflect a year of progress and backsliding on Broadway<p>Theres no sound in showbiz quite as crackling as a packed Broadway house. Arenas are certainly louder and stadiums more boisterous, but it's hard to beat a </p>New York <p>theater crowd when it comes to ironic alertness and urbane discernment. Virtuosity </p> among this set<p> isnt merely acknowledged but formally recognized.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-11/review-lea-michele-funny-girl-broadway-revival-review">Lea Michele took over the role</a> of Fanny Brice in the revival of Funny Girl" </p> at the start of the fall season<p>, the electricity in the audience could have powered the entire theater district. Michele was delivering a tour de force, but the energy that was coming off the stage at the August Wilson Theatre was being returned with interest. There was a </p> widespread <p>awareness that something momentous was taking place. </p> Everyone<p> seated around me  the great majority of whom paid a kings ransom to be there  understood just how lucky they were to experience this perfect confluence of performer and role. </p><p>I had a similar sense that something extraordinary was unfolding </p> on that same trip last October when I saw<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-28/broadways-leopoldstadt-tom-stoppard-jewish-identity">Leopoldstadt</a>," Tom Stoppards Tony-nominated epic drama about a </p> culturally engagedcultivated <p>Jewish family in Vienna thats nearly completely wiped out in the Holocaust. This is a work that only Stoppard could have written. I </p> say<p> this not because of the plays autobiographical origins but because of its grand verbal design, which captures the shifting European zeitgeist in what can only be described as a series of conversational oil paintings.</p><p>Tuned in to the historical pathos, the audience was just as attentive to the wit of Stoppards dialogue, not wanting to miss a beat of the banter, which resurrects in glistening theatrical form a vanished world. The atmosphere of hushed reverence was only heightened by the intellectual humor of an octogenarian playwright at the top of his game. Stoppards expansive vision was rewarded with a Broadway reception that matched the depth of the drama.</p><p>New York audiences have seen their fair share of productions of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapines Into the Woods. But <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-01-05/into-the-woods-and-merrily-we-roll-along-rise-above-their-shortcomings">Lear deBessonets revival</a> (heading to the Ahmanson Theatre later this month) made this musical deconstruction of classic fairy tales seem newly minted.</p><p>The humor was so fresh and the direction so revitalizing that the revival was able to accommodate a rotating cast. By the time I saw the production around the Christmas holidays, Sara Bareilles, who played the Bakers Wife, was no longer in the company. But her replacement was none other than Tony winner Stephanie J. Block, one of the most resplendent musical theater talents working today.</p><p>This was truly an ensemble affair, but a few performances left indelible impressions. Brian dArcy James in all his magnificent drollery as the Baker; Gavin Creel, endowing both the predatory Wolf and Cinderellas foppish Prince with distinctive swagger; Joaquina Kalukango, blasting the Witchs anthems to the dark skies above; and hilarious Katy Geraghty as the brashest Little Red Riding Hood </p> I've ever seen frolickingwho ever frolicked<p> to grandmothers house in the woods.</p><p>Forgive me for leaving out the other cast members (Alysia Velez's Rapunzel, Joshua Henry's Rapunzel's Prince!) who regardless of when they joined the production were part of a seamless whole. But one invaluable theatrical partner cant be left out  the audience, whose vocal delight made this theatergoing experience at the </p> St. James Theatre<p> the best holiday gift I received last year.</p> Ben Platt and his 'Parade' co-stars condemn antisemitic protesters 'spreading evil'<p>"Parade" had by far the quietest Broadway house I encountered on my spring trip. Silence can sometimes be a sign of disengagement. </p> This<p> was hardly the case here.</p><p>Clearly audible at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre was the concentration of </p> audience members,<p> who were following Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Browns complex musical about the historic tragedy of Leo Frank (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-18/ben-platt-tony-award-parade-leo-frank">Ben Platt</a>), a Jewish factory manager in the South who's found guilty of heinous crimes and ultimately lynched after the case against him reveals enormous cracks.</p><p>Platt credits director Michael Arden with turning the trial into a collective act of witnessing. The way members of the company are positioned to take in the proceedings, Platt explained, invites the audience to do the same. Platt, who remains on stage throughout the intermission as a kind of human exhibition of injustice, said that by the end the actors and the audience have nearly become one. </p><p>On the opposite end of the decibel scale is the new revival of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, starring <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-23/josh-groban-sweeney-todd-broadway-tonys">Josh Groban</a> and Annaleigh Ashford at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. Groban's adoring followers create a concert-like environment. The cheering begins even before Sweeney's numbers have e</p> nded<p>, so excited are </p> fans to see Groban<p> in the role of the homicidal barber in Sondheim and Hugh Wheelers musical thriller.</p><p>But rather than detract from the meticulousness of the performances, the enthusiasm only seems to elevate the caliber. I havent felt such vitality in a venue since Hamilton opened on Broadway in 2015. Thomas Kail, as it happens, directed both the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical and this satisfying revival, and credit goes to his canny deployment of seismic theatrical talent.</p><p>Ever modest, Groban insisted that the acclamation isn't just for him. He chalked it up to the star power of the ensemble and the new audience that has been turning out. </p><p>The thing thats been such an incredible surprise to us is how many gasps and Oh</p> ,<p> my Gods we hear in the audience, he said. Im lying there at the end and thinking, Oh, theyve never seen it before. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/d6/e8/5350575f4b0b99033e2895445e0d/xl1vlqpq.jpeg"></figure><p>The theatrical science that allows energy to flow freely between proscenium stage and auditorium is expertly put to use in Fat Ham, James Ijames</p>s<p> Pulitzer Prize-winning riff on Hamlet at the American Airlines Theatre.<b> </b>Marcel Spears, who plays Juicy, the Hamlet figure, regularly interrupts </p> athe<p> backyard barbecue to fill the audience in on the neo-Shakespearean situation thats rapidly reaching a boiling point. </p><p>Soliloquies can be performed in a way that keeps the audience at a distance. But Spears Juicy uses these fourth-wall breaches to invite the audience in. The tone is casual and comic, making it easy for us to let our guards down. But before we know it were being implicated in the question of whether a story necessarily has to be a tragedy. Do we have it in our power to choose comedy over catastrophe and thereby give ourselves another day to bungle along?</p><p>The communal spirit of </p>this Roundabout Theatre Company production<p>of "Fat Ham" was </p>such <p>a perfect way to conclude a trip </p> that filled me with a refreshing feeling of camaraderie<p>. </p> While <p>I still dont enjoy long bathroom lines or dealing with compulsive texters and raucous </p> latecomers,  . But <p>Broadway audiences deserve their own accolade for making the highs so much higher than they would otherwise have been this season. All the stress and strain of going to the theater subsides the moment the lights go down and a roomful of strangers collectively inhales in anticipation of magic. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The spirit of boldness that marked Broadways reopening in the wake of a once-in-a-century pandemic and widespread societal reckonings on equity, diversity and inclusion was still apparent, though bottom-line realities aggressively reasserted themselves. </p> Tony Awards 2023: 'Some Like it Hot,' 'A Doll's House' lead nominations<p>For every step forward, there was at least a half</p> -<p>step back. But progress is progress, no matter how halting or incremental. </p><p>The musical Some Like It Hot, spun from the classic 1959 Billy Wilder comedy, received 13 nominations, the most of any show. The Jessica Chastain-led revival of A Dolls House received </p> six6<p> nominations, as did Tom Stoppards magnificent historical epic <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-28/broadways-leopoldstadt-tom-stoppard-jewish-identity">Leopoldstadt</a> and Aint No Mo, Jordan E. Coopers daring political satire that closed early late last year amid a vocal campaign to keep the show alive.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/03/67/e6be790a4ff1b48ddff6a6fd89e5/kimberlyakimbo1069r.jpg"></figure><p>Kimberly Akimbo, a darling of the critics, received </p> eight8<p> nominations. The show  up for best musical along with &amp; Juliet, Shucked and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-04-26/new-york-new-york-broadway-musical-review">New York, New York, </a>all of which received </p> nine9<p> nominations, and Some Like It Hot  stands out for its originality, even if the David Lindsay-Abaire play from which it was adapted is still fresh in the minds of many theatergoers.</p><p>The best play category, more robust than usual, is loaded with eminent names and accolades. Three of the nominees  Martyna Majoks Cost of Living, James Ijames Fat Ham and Stephen Adly Guirgis <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/newsletter/2023-02-04/broadway-live-streaming-theater-between-riverside-and-crazy-pulitzer-essential-arts-arts-culture">Between Riverside and Crazy </a> have received the Pulitzer Prize for drama. And </p>Tom Stoppards<p> Leopoldstadt, a British import, won the prestigious Olivier Award.</p><p>Aint No Mo, the surprise of the best play category, notched a place that many assumed would have been given to Doug Wrights <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-04-24/broadway-review-sean-hayes-piano-good-night-oscar">Good Night, Oscar,</a> Suzie Millers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-04-28/commentary-jodie-comer-performance-in-prima-facie-sets-the-stage-for-the-e-jean-carroll-rape-trial">Prima Facie</a> or Life of Pi</p>e<p>, the puppet-filled adaptation by Lolita Chakrabarti of Yann Martels novel. The Tony nominating committee, which has become more discerning in recent years, helpfully reminds us that commercial salience is not necessarily the best indicator of artistic worthiness.</p><p>The quality of this dramatic harvest is a happy surprise for someone who has been wringing his hands over the future of the Broadway play for more than a decade. But how is anyone expected to choose between the disparate brilliance of "Fat Ham" and Leopoldstadt</p>,<p>" </p> in picking theirto choose my <p>favorite Broadway works of the season? </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/87/64/f98efe1844279f862a9d8483f419/ohiostate-038-copy.jpg"></figure><p>The optimal solution would be to give each of the nominees a trophy  an idea few would propose for the less impressive catch of new musicals, which are more vulnerable to box office pressures and punishments. Revivals are where one must look these days for inspired artistry in the musical sector.</p><p>The group of shows contending for musical revival is as strong as the best play category</p> :.<p> Into the Woods, a spry version of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine frolic (arriving at the Ahmanson Theatre in June); Lerner &amp; Lo</p> e<p>wes Camelot, revised by Aaron Sorkin and given a gorgeous staging by Bartlett Sher; a Parade brilliantly directed by Michael Arden that redeems the somber beauty of Jason Robert Browns complex score and a production of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street starring Josh Groban and Annaleigh Ashford that has perhaps the most electric Broadway house since Hamilton" opened in 2015.</p><p>Superlative acting is rarely in short supply on Broadway</p> ,<p> and sifting through the list of nominees, I am especially glad to see <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-01-06/audra-mcdonald-adrienne-kennedys-ohio-state-murders-broadway">Audra McDonald</a>, who holds the record for most Tony acting wins, nominated for her impassioned performance in Adrienne Kennedys Ohio State Murders and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/theater/riverside-and-crazy-apartment.html">Stephen McKinley Henderson</a>, </p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/theater/between-riverside-and-crazy-review.html">Between Riverside and Crazy</a></p><p> who received a nod for his seismic performance in Between Riverside and Crazy.</p><p>History was made with the first <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-02/tony-awards-history-first-openly-non-binary-actor-nominee">nonbinary-identifying</a> acting nominees  J. Harrison Ghee (one of the leads of "Some Like It Hot" who was nominated alongside co-star Christian Borle) and Alex Newell (a featured performer in "Shucked"). And in an advance for further representation&nbsp;of disability onstage (following Ali Stroker's 2019 Tony Award for "Oklahoma!") Katy Sullivan, a double-amputee from birth, received a nod for her acting in "Cost of Living," a performance she brought to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/theater/reviews/la-et-cm-cost-of-living-review-20181009-story.html">Fountain Theatre&nbsp;</a>in 2018.</p><p>Ben Platt and his co-star Micaela Diamond </p>(remember that name!)<p> were nominated for their heartrending performances in Parade. Groban and Ashford were likewise given nods for their ghoulish-comic teamwork in Sweeney Todd. These two shows seem locked in competition, though dont rule out <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-01-05/into-the-woods-and-merrily-we-roll-along-rise-above-their-shortcomings">Into the Woods,</a> which received </p> six6<p> nominations, including those for director Lear deBessonet, lead actress Sara Bareilles and lead actor Brian </p>DA d'A<p>rcy James, whose performance as the Baker was one of the seasons drollest.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/46/f1/dfc8cc78474bbf650835f6390410/new-york-new-york-cast-by-paul-kolnik.jpg"></figure><p>Chastain, the center of A Dolls House, is tipped to win for lead actress in a play, though she faces formidable competition from Jodie Comer, who won an Olivier for her gripping solo work in Prima Facie. And Victoria Clark is probably the odds-on favorite to win for lead actress in a musical for her turn as a teenager suffering from a disorder that is transforming her into an elderly woman while shes still in high school.</p><p>Sean Hayes may have the edge for his un-sitcom-y portrayal of Oscar Levant in Good Night, Oscar, though Wendell Pierce delivered a knockout performance in the all-Black revival of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-09/death-of-a-salesman-broadway-2022-review-wendell-pierce">Death of a Salesman.</a> Henderson in Between Riverside and Crazy would be my choice, but I missed seeing the nominated stars of Suzan-Lori Parks Topdog/Underdog, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and Corey Hawkins, which closed in January. </p><p>And look out for Samuel L. Jackson, nominated for featured actor in August Wilson's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-13/review-samuel-l-jackson-august-wilson-the-piano-lesson-revival">"The Piano Lesson."</a> The production, directed by LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Jackson's wife, is considered a front</p>-<p>runner for best revival. </p><p>I wasnt quite as taken by Kimberly Akimbo as some of my colleagues </p> were<p>. The book by Lindsay-Abaire and the score by Jeanine Tesori and Lindsay-Abaire are both nominated, though they cry out for tightening. (I would have loved this show to death as a one-act musical.) But I was delighted to see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/26/theater/justin-cooley-kimberly-akimbo-broadway.html">Justin Cooley</a></p>, in a memorable Broadway debut,<p> given some recognition for his endearing featured performance</p> , in a memorable Broadway debut, <p>as the title character's tenderly loyal friend, and Im relieved to see creative independence heartily encouraged in such commercially angst-ridden times.</p> J. Harrison Ghee, Alex Newell make Tony Awards history as first nonbinary-identifying actor nominees<p>Lea Michele, who gave what was for me the best Broadway performance of the season in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-11-17/lea-michelle-funny-girl-broadway-cast-album-release-date">Funny Girl,</a> wasnt eligible for Tony consideration given that she replaced Beanie Feldstein</p>  in the leading role of Fanny Brice<p>. But trouper that shes become, she announced the awards with </p> MylesMJ<p> Frost, who won a Tony last year for his mesmerizing performance as Michael Jackson in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/newsletter/2022-05-21/essential-arts-mj-michael-jackson-musical-broadway-essential-arts">MJ The Musical.</a></p><p>Micheles presence signaled something we could all use reminding of during awards season  that excellence is its own reward.

Canceled and revived within the space of about 72 hours, the June 11 live ceremony was caught in the crossfire of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-01/writers-strike-what-to-know-wga-guild-hollywood-productions">ongoing writers' strike</a>: Its broadcast home, CBS, is part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the group with which the Writers Guild of America has been at an impasse since May 2.</p><p>"The Tony Awards was established to recognize excellence in the craft of theater</p>-<p>making and all the different categories of people who work extremely hard to put on shows all year, but we just happen to celebrate on TV every year so that we can reach as many people as possible," said Scott Sanders, theater producer and member of the Tony Awards Management Committee, the group that negotiated with the guild to avoid a Tony-night picket line.</p><p>"In our conversations with the WGA, we said, 'We're in complete support of your mission to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-04-10/writers-revolt-wga-hollywood-labor-strike">get a fair and equitable contract</a>,'" Sanders continued. "'This year in particular, when the theater is just coming out of a two-year catastrophic window from COVID, is there any way that you can allow our show to continue?'"</p><p>Though it ultimately secured a compromise that will <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2023-05-15/tony-awards-writers-guild-ceremony-compromise">allow the ceremony to proceed</a>, albeit in </p> an <p>altered form, the Tony Award Management Committee's position  and the underlying fear of a Tonys-free year  exposed just how dependent the American theater industry has become on the annual celebration.</p> With Regional Theatre Tony win, Pasadena Playhouse is undoubtedly out of the woods<p>Founded in 1947 and televised since 1967, the Tonys' acceptance speeches and musical numbers are not a major force in the ratings; last years ceremony <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/arts/television/tony-awards-ratings.html">drew 3.9 million viewers</a>, its second-lowest viewership ever recorded. But for an art form buffeted by a halting post</p>-<p>pandemic recovery, rising ticket prices and competition with countless other entertainment offerings, the awards telecast remains perhaps the most important night of the year.</p><p>"It's just a fact that Broadway shows don't have the type of marketing budgets and general exposure that sporting events and movies do," said "&amp; Juliet" producer </p> Eva Price.<p> "And the number of people we can reach on any given night are finite because we're confined to the four walls of our theater  not to every movie theater in the country, not to a 20,000-person stadium. </p><p>"But for so many people like me, who grew up in Chelmsford, Mass.</p> ,achusetts<p> and did not see my first Broadway show until I was 15, the Tony Awards is a way into Broadway that feels real and accessible," she continued. "It's a beautiful sales tool that actually has a very real ripple effect on the box office."</p><p>The "Tonys bump" is particularly influential among tourists, many of whom plan their visits to New York City around the shows they plan to watch. "We see who wins, and then we immediately buy our tickets for our trip in the winter, six months in advance," said Taylor Wyatt, a stay-at-home mom from just outside Orlando, Fla., who has traveled to New York with her mother annually for 18 years. "Because we know, once the Tonys air, everybody's thinking the same thing: 'This is the hit show this season, I have to see it.'"</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/55/cd/33359835481dbde6984a0fae094b/230203-bam-thesign-531.jpg"></figure><p>Though plays, unlike musicals, are only featured during the ceremony through brief, pretaped clips of the productions, victory can secure ticket sales from patrons faced with a plethora of options. </p><p>"There are people out there who are programmed to choose what they're going to see based on what wins at the Tonys," said John Johnson, who produced "The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window" and "Ain't No Mo'" this season. "If they've been hearing about Jessica Chastain and Jodie Comer, sure, any person would like to see all of them, but between the resources of money and time, they're not going to go see everything. And so when a show wins or a performer wins, it cuts through the conversation of what someone should see in a way that bumps you up to the top of people's lists."</p><p>The benefit isn't limited to the marquee awards for best play, musical, and revivals, either  especially for productions with limited runs. When </p> actors both <p>Glenda Jackson and Laurie Metcalf </p> both<p> won for 2018's "Three Tall Women," Johnson, also a producer on that show, saw "a nice boost." People received a clear message, he said: "These are the performances of the year, and you have three more weeks to see them." For already-closed shows, wins can help attract licensing from regional theaters, universities and high schools.</p> How 'Six' turned a huge theater faux pas into a game-changing phenomenon<p>For nominated musicals, which are highlighted through live performances of select numbers throughout the telecast, the Tonys are an even more important showcase. "Shucked," a pop-country comedy set in a small town whose crop of corn has mysteriously gone awry, "is not based on anything and doesn't have any stars in it," said its producer</p>  Mike Bosner<p>  but the Tonys can help establish a presence for recently opened shows that don't yet have an easily recognizable brand. "The word 'shucked' means nothing to most people! So it's 10 times harder to explain a show like ours to people when you're not</p> showing<p> them what it is, and a performance on national television is the easiest way to do that."</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-05-02/some-like-it-hot-and-dolls-house-lead-2023-tony-award-nominations">Tony nominations announcement</a> can bring an initial boost  "Shucked" has sold a million dollars in advance tickets since it earned nine nominations earlier this month  a memorable musical performance can be particularly powerful. According to Bosner, "Beautiful: The Carole King Musical," on which he was a producer, had been running on Broadway for seven months by the time of the 2014 Tonys, where it was up for seven awards. The Tonys performance, featuring King herself with the cast, "sent us through the stratosphere," he recalled.</p><p>"The box office just kept going up and up and up, and we did nine productions around the world of that show. I don't want to say that that's only because of the Tony Awards; a good show finds its legs and finds its life. But the Tonys bring attention to these shows in a very real way."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/df/89/7b3d47db464990d610aa5e6f63b5/juliet-company-in-blow-0830-photo-credit-matthew-murphy.jpg"></figure><p>The importance of the </p> Tony <p>platform is reflected in the productions' own investment in it. According to the Tony Awards Management Committee's Sanders, who produced "The Color Purple" musical revival that received 4<b> </b>nominations in 2016, fees for performers, musicians, costumers, movers and others can cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  and that's only partially covered by the broadcast itself.</p><p>"When you're talking about 30 cast members getting up there and doing a big musical number with singing and dancing, that's an expensive proposition," </p> he said<p>. "The shows contribute that substantial money to be on the Tonys because they see the value of having that 3 1/2</p>three-and-a-half<p>-minute commercial for their musical."</p><p>The best-case scenario? When a stellar performance wins over a skeptic. "I'm more of a jukebox musical guy  the artsy musicals aren't usually my thing, and when I saw a couple of commercials for 'Hadestown,' that's what I thought it was gonna be," said Jason Broomfield, </p> a <p>mortgage underwriter manager in the Detroit area who visits New York regularly. "But their Tonys performance blew me away. I was really, really surprised, and I bought a ticket that night for the following weekend. Until that performance, 'Hadestown' was not something that I would have sought out at all."</p> J. Harrison Ghee, Alex Newell make Tony Awards history as first nonbinary-identifying actor nominees<p>Although this year's Tonys will reportedly feature both the awarding of prizes and the performance of numbers from nominated shows, the prospect of its cancellation  and the backdrop of declining ratings for awards shows across the board  has raised the question: Is Broadway </p>too<p> reliant on </p> the awards<p> to spark interest and ticket sales? </p> And <p>in the age of streaming, time-shifting and social media, is focusing so much marketing muscle on a single night of live broadcast TV </p>television <p>a sustainable long-term plan?</p><p>Numerous producers told The Times that counting on the Tonys bump is a dangerous strategy, especially for productions that have already been struggling to fill enough seats to cover </p>their <p>operating costs. Unlike a movie playing for months in a cinema, the overhead for live theatrical productions continues throughout the run, yet it's not uncommon for shows to operate at a loss for an extended period in the hope that a Tony nomination or win will change the financial picture.</p><p>"It may be a bit optimistic," Sanders acknowledged, "if you open the show in February, and its struggling through March, April and May and barely hanging on by a thread, and the only answer is, 'If we win the Tony for best musical, we can survive.'"</p><p>Still, producers understand why some shows tread water until the Tonys. </p>Said Bosner,<p> "Sometimes, there is no other option, we've run out of different roads to go through, and that might really be the most viable path forward. There are situations where that is the case</p>. Thankfully, we're not in that place right now.<p>," said Bosner.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/fa/de/59d992f54ff0810cf1ef33179d22/shucked-s-1690.jpg"></figure><p>Several theatermakers have been inspired to explore other avenues for publicizing the nominated titles </p> this year<p>. "Shucked" became the first Broadway show ever to appear on "The Voice" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se4BmMXQ7Do">when Alex Newell performed on Monday's season finale</a>, and "New York, New York" lyricist Lin-Manuel Miranda resurrected #Ham4Ham, a series of casual concerts outside the "Hamilton" venue that regularly go viral, to showcase selections from all of the</p>  b<p>est </p> m<p>usical and </p>Best Musical  r<p>evival nominees.</p><p>It occurred to me that  as much as we love the Tonys  they should not be the be-all, end-all of your exposure to this incredible theater season, <a href="https://www.broadwaynews.com/lin-manuel-miranda-says-the-tony-awards-should-not-be-the-be-all-end-all-of-access-to-this-broadway-season/">Miranda said before an outdoor performance last week</a>. "We have so much to celebrate, and we have such an amazing season of theater now that we are mostly through the pandemic, and people are coming to support live theater again."</p><p>For now, though, the benefits Broadway reaps from the Tony Awards telecast outweigh the risks of tying the industry's fate to a ceremony that's subject to all the same disruptions as live theater, live TV </p> and,<p> life itself. As Sanders acknowledged, "It's a precarious art form."</p><p>"There are some new shows that opened either in the late fall or spring that, if they don't get this national television exposure, I would bet they would not have made it through the summer," he said. "Delaying the Tonys until after the strike would have made a huge difference to hundreds of members of the theater community who would have lost their jobs because the shows would have closed, and it would have been devastating."</p> Thankfully    for the fans and artists , the ceremony will air live as scheduled, and its target audience   of theatermakers and supporters will be tuned in . <p>Broomfield already has a post-Tonys trip booked, and plans on purchasing tickets for shows later that night. "I would imagine that 'Kimberly Akimbo' is probably going to win the Tony this year. I've heard a lot of good things, but it's not one of those shows I would normally seek out. But I'm looking forward to seeing them perform at the Tonys and seeing if it ends up being something that I want to see."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Young Fly.</p><p>My boy Nick Cannon is so petty, he couldnt get Cardi B, so he got Azealias ugly a, D.C. Young Fly said when it was his turn to toss an insult toward Banks team. But Banks didnt fire back with a lyric of her own. Instead she grabbed the mic and told D.C. Young Fly that his comments were anti-Black, adding that there should be no colorism on the stage.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-06-05/dc-young-fly-breaks-silence-death-ms-jacky-oh">Cardi B, DL Hughley, T.I. and other celebrities have shared messages</a> of support and expressed </p>mourning their sorrow<p> over the death of Ms Jacky Oh, Banks shared a slew of insults <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/azealiabanksforever/3119755606811020739/" target="_blank">via her Instagram stories</a> on Tuesday.</p> More details emerge about 'Wild 'N Out' star Ms Jacky Oh's death at 32<p>Damn, Dc Young Fly spent years disguising his own deeply rooted hatred of self as jokes pointed at womens beauty, she wrote. Projecting his own feelings about his own ugliness unto women perfectly secure in their own skin.</p><p>Banks added that when she cried after her appearance on the MTV show five years ago, they were pure tears of rage and not at all a sign of weakness.</p><p>Because in the end. I won, she added. Im happy I cried and moved on. That Jackie o </p>(sic)<p> girl must have been so deeply insecure about herself. . . And the nerve of DC to call such a gorgeous woman as Azealia Banks . . . ugly on National television.</p><p>In a follow-up post, Banks said </p>Jackys <p>Oh's death was ironic.</p><p>Dead at 32 exactly on my 32nd birthday, May 31st, 2023 in Miami, FL, she continued, before adding that people would "learn" not to mess with her. </p><p>The thorn in my side is finally out, she wrote in the concluding post.</p><p>Fans did not take Banks' comments lightly and slammed the singer for her "tasteless" and "hateful" remarks. </p><p>"You need to heal," one user wrote. "All that hate in your heart, and you get satisfaction from death? Tasteless and crunchy just like Bojangles."</p><p>"Kids lost a mother and u thinking about a f joke !! Thats what u was on the f show for !! Thats what comedians do," exclaimed another. </p><p>Also in the replies, "Yeah ... good luck with everything after this bc you've crossed a line that you won't recover from." </p> DC Young Fly breaks silence after the death of his partner, Ms Jacky Oh. She was 32Ms Jacky <p>Oh starred on MTV's Wild N Out and shared three children with her longtime partner, D.C. Young Fly. She died in Miami, where she had reportedly traveled to undergo a mommy makeover surgery, according to a since-deleted social media post. Her cause of death is not yet known.</p>Jacky<p> Oh, born Jacklyn Smith, was staying at a Homewood Suites by Hilton hotel in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami, where she was found unresponsive on the evening of May 31, according to a Miami Police Department incident report obtained by The Times. Police were dispatched, and she was transported to a hospital. Despite resuscitation efforts, she was pronounced dead shortly before midnight. The case is under investigation.</p><p>D.C.

She recently spent a weekend in Knoxville, Tenn., performing a series of concerts with Yo-Yo Ma and Chris Thile. She has a new album, her first collection of all</p> -<p>original songs, coming out in August. Shes <a href="https://www.ojaifestival.org/rhiannon-giddens-2023-music-director/" target="_blank">music director of the Ojai Music Festival</a> this weekend. And she just won a Pulitzer.</p><p>Giddens remembers meeting the late banjo player </p> Mick Moloney<p> several years ago, and his very first words to her were not Hello, or How are you, but  she says, imitating his Irish brogue  Have you learned to say </p>no<p> yet?</p><p>The Grammy-winning </p> singer, songwriter, banjo player, childrens author, actor, opera composer singer / songwriter / banjo player / childrens author / actor / opera composer<p> is, indeed, saying no to more and more potential opportunities these days, and she appreciates how good of a problem that is. But she also knows how being a journeyman musician in todays world makes saying no almost impossible.</p><p>The way that weve set up freelance artists is ridiculous, Giddens says, because to get anywhere, you have to say yes to everything. Its part of your psyche, and so you get to the point where you dont have to say yes to everything but you dont know how to stop.</p> The radical inclusiveness of Rhiannon Giddens<p>Giddens is tireless in her work. A founding member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops, for more than a decade shes been illuminating the unsung Black history of the banjo and bluegrass music  most recently as host of a </p> 10ten<p>-part educational series, Banjo, for the streaming service Wondrium.</p><p>In 2020, she inherited Yo-Yo Mas mantle as artistic director of Silkroad, a music project that smashes cultural and genre boundaries. Her upcoming album, Youre the One, is a manifestation of her belief that borders and genres are ridiculous, because youve got a Patti Page kind of thing next to a doo-wop 60s thing.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-21/rhiannon-giddens-omar-los-angeles-opera">Her opera Omar</a>  which she </p>co-<p>composed with Michael Abels  is now a Pulitzer-winning </p> work. proof that old divisions and criteria in the high art world are open to debate<p> Although </p> she is <p>a classically trained opera singer, Giddens has no formal composition training, and she wrote Omar with her banjo and voice, which Abels then arranged and enriched for orchestra. Its the first time a music Pulitzer has gone to a collaborative pair. For Giddens, the prize declared to the world that this could be the future of opera. It doesnt have to be a little man in a garret, composing based on compositional techniques that have been taught in the academy. This </p>too<p> can be opera.</p> Commentary: Redemption, writ large, in L.A. Opera's divine 'Omar'<p>Giddens was at a house party in Ojai two years ago, where she was a visiting artist at the Ojai Music Festival, and I was just talking about my love for blasting down genre walls</p>,<p> and the early music Ive been experimenting with my partner Francesco, and world music, and classical, and </p> W<p>hat does classical mean? Ara Guzelimian, the festivals artistic and executive director, was there and the next day he sent Giddens a text: What do you think about coming back here in a couple years and actually putting this to the test?</p><p>Working with her partne</p> r Francesco Turrisi, <p>an Italian multi-instrumentalist, Giddens began assembling an international dream team for this years festival that included members of Silkroad</p>  such as like <p>Wu Man, the Chinese pipa virtuoso, and Kayhan Kalhor, a kamancheh player from Iran.</p><p>Wu saw Giddens perform at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville a few years ago, and it touched me very, very deeply, she says. Its just amazing, like, where does the energy come from? ... Its giant. And also the presence on the stage  very few artists are like that, to me." </p>When she talks, always right into the topic, direct to the audience. And plus  female! Wu says with a laugh.<p>The opening-night program will feature the aptly titled Liquid Borders composed by </p> Gabriela Ortiz,<p> performed by the percussion quartet </p> R<p>ed </p> F<p>ish </p> B<p>lue </p> F<p>ish. The rest of the weekend, between morning meditations and moon viewings  and all of the liminal spaces where Giddens says so much magic can happen  will include an eclectic brew of chamber works, solo improvisations, pipa tunes from the </p> 7thseventh <p>century and ancient Persian music, and newer works by Chinese composers and several pieces by Iranian women, such as Aida Shirazi and Nina Barzegar.</p><p>A centerpiece is Tan Duns Ghost Opera, which Wu made famous with the Kronos Quartet in the 1990s and will perform here with the Attacca Quartet  accompanied by a dance choreographed by PeiJu Chien-Pott, a Martha Graham alumna from Taiwan.</p><p>Another highlight is a new 70-minute, chamber-sized concert adaptation of Giddens and Abels opera. In Omars Journey, Giddens herself will sing the important role of Julie.</p> How Rhiannon Giddens and Michael Abels turned an enslaved man's narrative into an opera<p>The opera has now been staged in South Carolina, L.A.</p>,<p> and Boston, with future productions scheduled in San Francisco and Chicago  but so far there has been no recording. When it won the Pulitzer, Giddens first thought was: Maybe we can get the recording made now! </p><p>The festival will culminate in an improvised concert where string players  including Giddens, Wu and Kalhor  will bring their respective instruments and just jam. Wu is excited: Finally we get </p> the<p> chance to '</p> L<p>et's party together!'" she says. Kayhor sounds a tad more nervous. Thats not usually what I do, he says, laughing. But I think this is one of the specialties of Ojai, and I welcome it.</p>Wu often improvises with other musicians in traditional Chinese music  she says a translation of jam session would be  (Ji-Xin), roughly gathering together, lets play  but doing so with virtuosos and strings from other parts of the world will be a unique treat.<p>In her mission to erase old concepts and divisions, Giddens expects to make people just a little uncomfortable.</p><p>There is an element of uncertainty about a program like this, she says, which is the point. There will be years where everything has been written out, and every concert has all pieces programmed, and theyve been practiced and everything. This is not that year. ... I think everybody will have moments of, like, Im not sure whats going to happen right now. But I think thats powerful.</p><p>Giddens is perpetually jet</p> -<p>lagged. She used to drag her kids around the world with her  I was like 250 days a year with an infant, she says, I mean, </p>hardcore<p>  but not so much now that theyre both in school. Though her daughter, who just started playing the cello, will join Giddens in Ojai as a gofer.</p><p>The 46-year-old says she would have quit the music industry years ago if it werent for what her ancestors went through, and she didnt have that flame to take care of. But shes also inspired by other tireless musicians </p> including like <p>Ma and Dolly Parton, who parlay their fame into trying to make the world a better place for as many people as they can.</p>In all of her While <p>flying around  and her flight ever higher in acclaim  Giddens is starting to ask herself bigger questions: What is music for? How have we caged it and commodified it? </p>She notes how people will pay $2,000 to have one experience with superstar artists like Taylor Swift instead of making time to learn how to play the guitar or make music with other people themselves, to sing or write or draw.<p>And its not to say that you cant do both, says Giddens, but weve leached the everyday art out of our lives, and then packaged it up. What does that mean that you have writers and musicians, who are ostensibly doing the thing that humans have been needing for, like, millennia for their mental health, but theyre making kajillions of dollars? Whereas the vast group of people  journeymen  who are doing this as well are making peanuts? And then you have the majority of people in general who arent doing any of it. That seems like a balance thats not right to me.</p><p>So her mission continues.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The plots celebrated mayhem: chain</p> -<p>saw-wielding maniacs, murderous supernatural forces or a young woman on a revenge killing spree. There was fake blood (gallons of it), as well as gratuitous female nudity (cue the bouncing </p> bosomstits<p>). And don't forget the screamy posters that boasted</p> , for one example, <p>"the most violent, blood-spurting fight ever filmed!"</p><p>This 70s-era genre may be fondly remembered by directors such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2022-11-03/why-quentin-tarantino-will-never-make-a-marvel-film-i-dont-need-a-job">Quentin Tarantino</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2023-05-11/review-hypnotic-robert-rodriguez-ben-affleck-neo-noir">Robert Rodriguez</a>, but these cheap flicks often inhabited a spot on the cinematic spectrum between god</p> -<p>awful and unwatchable. "Exploitation movies were like layers of grit wrapped around a few minutes of 'the good stuff'  full-frontal childbirth, the flaccid genitals of middle-aged sun worshippers, a woman being scalped," wrote journalist and horror writer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-jc-paperbacks-from-hell-20171012-story.html">Grady Hendrix</a> of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2007/04/grindhouse-nostalgia-is-lame.html">grindhouse</a> in 2007. "Savvy distributors with calculators for eyes grabbed on to these exploitable elements and flogged the hell out of them."</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/la-xpm-2013-apr-19-la-ca-jc-sammy-harkham-20130421-story.html">Sammy Harkham</a>'s new graphic novel, "<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7748/9780593316696" target="_blank">Blood of the Virgin</a>," carves out an imaginary corner of this pitiless sector of the movie industry and takes up residence.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/8e/30/74285a814b02af16112b0872331a/9780593316696.jpg"></figure><p>It is 1971 and Seymour, our protagonist, is a young immigrant  an Iraqi Jew raised in Australia  who toils as a movie editor for a grindhouse film studio in Los Angeles that bears the incongruous name of Reverie. There, he helps assemble pictures with names like "Cobra Women," "Jungle Bitches" and "Sadist." Naturally, he aspires to direct a screenplay of his own, titled "Blood of the Virgin." (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/11/movies/celebrating-france-s-directors-who-rode-the-new-wave.html">Nouvelle Vague</a>, it ain't.)</p><p>The real horror isn't the film's plot, but everything Seymour endures to get his picture made. There's the impetuous studio boss who wants to hand the project over to another director who hacks away pages of dialogue. There's the leading lady who projectile vomits a tuna sandwich on location. And there's the financier who yanks funding in the middle of the shoot, preferring to use the money on tiling his roof. Don't worry, one of Reverie's honchos tells Seymour, "you're an editor, you'll make it work."</p><p>The messiness of Seymour's professional life is paralleled by a chaotic personal life. Seymour and his wife, Ida  who is entirely unimpressed by the movie business  are new parents, and their infant has been steadily </p> eroding <p>their sanity and their sleep. Ida is exhausted and Seymour is too wrapped up in his movie (and getting schnockered at industry parties) to show much sympathy. He condescends; she bites back: "You always smile when you insult me."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/f7/ad/c8c3dcba4fb5a9775ff6564c0673/blood-of-the-virgin-chapter3art.jpg"></figure><p>These parallel narratives are intersected by others that enter and exit the book: the story of Ida's mother, a Hungarian immigrant who survived the Holocaust, as well as </p> that of<p> Joe Clayton, an impressionable Arizona cowboy with Hollywood stars in his eyes. In between are the workaday yarns of aspiring auteurs scratching out a living at the bottom rungs of the movie business. </p><p>In one scene, a special effects technician goes through the steps required to make a human head explode on</p>-<p>screen. Another takes us to a party at the studio boss' house, where screenwriters and techs huddle in the kitchen and debate the merits of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-appreciation3aug03-story.html">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>. Back at work, they shoot a scene where a woman bursts into flames. </p><p>"I'm not really a horror guy," says a sound man to a co</p> -<p>worker. "Me neither," responds the colleague. Yet this is the world they labor in.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/6e/dc/9ac397eb4d8da289a19c9e52acd6/sammy-harkham-author-drawing.jpeg"></figure><p>To these stories, Harkham adds the language of cinema, including intercutting and match cuts (where the formal elements of one scene are echoed in the next for visual continuity). A sequence showing an inebriated Seymour and another man behaving abominably with a drunk woman at a party cuts to images of Ida caring for the couple's infant son. In another, the baby wails as Ida attempts to masturbate. She makes tea and the kettle screams. You can practically hear the intermingling sounds leap off the page. </p><p>These visual sequences, in which dialogue is kept to a bare minimum or dispensed with entirely, are among the most powerful in the book  a technique Harkham has deployed to terrific effect in the past. His 2012 collection, <a href="https://www.artbook.com/9780985159504.html">"Everything Together: Collected Stories,"</a> featured a wrenching, minimally</p>-<p> drawn story about a sailor who abandons his beloved to face adventure on the high seas and then struggles to return home. (The collection won a </p> 2012<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/la-mediagroup-20130419-htmlstory.html">Los Angeles Times Book Prize</a></p> in 2012<p>.)</p><p>Particularly intriguing to me is the way Harkham, who was born and raised principally in Los Angeles, captures the city's shabby 1970s profile  in color, but mainly in monochromatic black, white and brown. Gas station signs rise above flat landscapes while Spanish Revival homes and Googie structures grasp at faded panache. Seymour and Ida inhabit not a glam Hollywood Hills home</p>,<p> but a moldy court apartment. Harkham avoids the trope of a gleaming Hollywood sign standing triumphantly at the top of </p> a<p> mountain. Probably because, in the 70s, the sign was <a href="https://laist.com/news/1978-photo-of-hollywood-sign-badly">falling apart</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c6/2d/e95183604fdead73959845882777/153-blood-of-the-virgin.jpg"></figure><p>"Blood of the Virgin" is epic in scale for a graphic novel  checking in at nearly 300 pages. Harkham spent 14 years on it, and the labor pays off. His previous collection showed an artist who was still coming into his voice, with drawing styles and storytelling methods that varied from one tale to another. Omnipresent was the influence of comics </p>M m<p>inimalist <a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/la-xpm-2012-oct-28-la-ca-jc-chris-ware-20121028-story.html">Chris Ware</a>, known for his spare drawing style and his tight, diagrammatic sequences.</p><p>The new book shows Harkham settled into a style all his own and an expert sense of pacing. Pithy chatter among a multitude of characters occupies a dense grid, but a dream sequence is more loosely rendered, dispensing with the traditional black borders between images. In that scene, Seymour finds himself in a car chase through a landscape that could have been plucked out of one of L.A. photographer Anthony Hernandez's <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/10983Y">"Automotive Landscapes"</a> pictures of the 1970s. When he blinks awake, the adventure evaporates and he get</p> s<p> back to work.</p><p>Grindhouse movies may have fed the very basic urge to witness sex and death. "Blood of the Virgin" is infinitely more complex, braiding together narratives about love that waxes and wanes, about failure and success, elation and resentment</p> ,<p> and, ultimately, what it means to "make it" in a biz that carries the word </p>"<p>exploitation</p>"<p> in its core.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

A statewide high-school oratory contest is in town, and the kids are speechifying on Why Do Americans Believe in Democracy? A good question Id like to hear the answer to, he muses.</p><p>Well </p>of course<p> he would. Across five books, starting with 1986s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-08-09-tm-353-story.html">The Sportswriter</a>, Bascombe has been Fords Great American Gasbag, a </p>B b<p>oomer riffing on money, marriage, parenthood, success, failure, democracy and the American way. Frank arrived at a time when literary fiction was studded with such men, from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-05-27-bk-273-story.html">Walker Percy</a>s Binx Bolling to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jan-28-me-john-updike28-story.html">John Updike</a>s Rabbit Angstrom to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-philip-roth-appreciation-ulin-20180523-htmlstory.html">Philip Roth</a>'s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-dec-01-et-quick1.6-story.html">Nathan Zuckerman</a>. Indeed, for a time, such figures were synonymous for many with American literary fiction  readers </p>en<p>trusted middle-aged white guys and their fictional alter egos to synthesize the national experience.</p><p>In the decades since, enthusiasm for fiction thats just middle-aged-plus white guys riffing on things has  diminished. Ford is aware: Frank, now 74 and reporting from the political wilds of 2020, is diminished too. Now that he is semi</p>-<p>retired from the real </p>-<p>estate business, his life has narrowed to caring for his long-troubled son, Paul, who is battling <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2022-08-31/author-cai-emmons-on-writing-while-running-out-of-time-fall-arts-preview">ALS</a>. When youre in charge of a failing son little else goes on, he says, with a hint of resentment from a man who wants to talk about everything going on.</p><p>Like every Bascombe novel, this one is set in the days before a holiday, and this time Frank is shuttling Paul from Minnesotas <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-04-28/mayo-clinic-pence">Mayo Clinic</a> toward <a href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-rushmore-pg-photogallery.html">Mt. Rushmore</a>, slated to arrive on Valentines Day. Hes alienated from Paul, a hard case thick with sarcasm and hobbies he cant relate to. (Paul is a mediocre-at-best ventriloquist with an affection for British show tunes singer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-apr-15-mn-27590-story.html">Anthony Newley</a>.) The Hallmark holiday is a grim reminder that romantic relationships are absent for Paul and in the rear</p>-<p>view mirror for Frank, whos reduced to a kinda-sorta relationship with a masseuse. He writes her a Valentines Day card  with $200 tucked in, her usual fee.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/7b/44/9db630b54aaa8aeb3e26fcaefc37/be-mine-hc-credit-ecco.JPG"></figure><p>Ford has always designed Frank to be a little pathetic: The tension in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-08-09-tm-353-story.html">The Sportswriter</a> and its two follow-ups, 1995s Pulitzer Prize-winning <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-02-bk-19304-story.html">Independence Day</a> and 2006s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-oct-22-bk-ulin22-story.html">The Lay of the Land</a>, was always between Franks proclaimed virtues, success and wisdom and his shortcomings as a father or spouse. The thrill of those books was in witnessing how he tried to talk through the struggle, sometimes self-aware and sometimes not. He could be brought to heel  shot by an AR-15, breaking down over the loss of his first son  but he pressed on.</p><p>The change in Be Mine is that Franks observations are more persistently downcast, as he  but Ford, really  struggles to build up a head of steam around what he observes. (That was also an issue with the janky linked stories in the fourth Bascombe book, 2014s Let Me Be Frank With You, but he had a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-et-rutten1-2008oct01-story.html">Forever War</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2012-oct-29-la-na-sandy-science-20121030-story.html">Hurricane Sandy</a> to work with.)</p><p>Now Frank is obsessed with happiness and unsure if hell attain it. He suspects hes always the butt of a joke  from his snarky son, from the unctuous staffers at the Mayo, from the woman renting him an RV for the Rushmore trip. (Said RV is named the Windbreaker, another joke.) If three house moves are the psychic equivalent of a death, a sons diagnosis of ALS is equal to crashing your car into a wall day after day, with the outcome always the same, he laments.</p><p>Not much happens in Be Mine in terms of plot  its a straight drive west to Rushmore  and what does happen is marinated in Franks bemusement and ambivalence. He observes protesters at a mall complaining about Valentines Day in a feeble attempt to satirize a woke mob (VALENTINES DEMEANS WOMEN AND LOVE); witnesses a hostage situation and a bad accident; visits a casino; and arrives at his destination.</p><p>The presidents chiseled in the rock are smaller than expected, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-07-03/mount-rushmore-sculptor-racist">less likable</a> (None of these candidates could get a vote today  slavers, misogynists, homophobes, warmongers, historical slyboots, all playing with house money.)</p>.<p> Bascombes America circa February 2020 is more uncertain, and Frank is less on top of it. He sees an RV with both Biden and Trump stickers, to be on the safe side.</p><p>This wishy-washiness is Franks problem, but also the novels. Be Mine lacks the forward thrust of the first two Bascombe novels  both classics, however gassy. And its all the more frustrating because there are moments throughout the book where Franks status as a world-class observer is fully, delightfully intact. The book is studded with pitch-perfect observations of shabby-tacky American everydayness: a hospital waiting room (non-aggressive paneling, tasteful, nearly-good plein air wall art), a casino (an elevated bank of TVs above a taxidermied wolverine doing combat with a taxidermied coyote over a taxidermied rabbit); Donald Trump (tuberous limbs, prognathous jaw, looking in all directions at once, seeking approval but not finding enough); life itself (ants scrabbling on a cupcake).</p><p>Early Bascombe novels were overrun with lines like those; now theyre relatively starved for them. A 70-something man ground down by divorce and loss shouldnt be expected to be in good humor, of course. But its not unreasonable to expect fiction to be a lively guide into that feeling of being ground down. Frank tries. Ford tries. But mostly Frank is driving down a straight line in barren prairie land, heading toward his inevitable fate.</p>Athitakis is a writer in Phoenix and  the author of "The New Midwest."                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

A skilled builder, in a moment of carelessness he fell off a roof and shattered his bones. In <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7748/9781324000464">Such Kindness</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/books/la-ca-andre-dubus-20110403-story.html">Andre Dubus III</a> offers Tom as an angry <a href="https://www.latimes.com/style/la-hm-buddhaside12-2008jun12-story.html">Siddhartha Gautama</a>, the pre-enlightenment Buddha, resentful and grieving all that he has lost and as yet unaware of any path forward.</p><p>As the book opens, Tom is sitting in a car with his neighbor, Trina, and Jamey, the young man driving them to the home of Toms banker. They pass <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-10-21-vw-3924-story.html">Phillips Academy</a>, the prep school in Andover, Mass., a place dedicated to opening door after door for its students, most of whom come from families for whom doors are rarely closed anyway. Toms resentment is the neon glare reflecting off the streets.</p><p>The banker had urged Tom to take out a mortgage, then foreclosed when Toms injury made work impossible. Toms half-baked plan is to take revenge by stealing cash-advance checks from the bankers trash. When that scheme is thwarted, Tom returns to his <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-19/california-outlawed-section-8-housing-discrimination-why-it-still-persists">Section 8</a> apartment. Alone on his couch, he rehearses the litany of troubles that have led him there. The injury, months of rehab, unrelenting pain. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-04-13/review-the-family-that-crippled-america-the-sacklers-get-a-full-biography">painkillers</a> that became a problem until he weaned himself from them. The alcohol that is his pain distracter. His busted marriage. His college-age</p>d<p> son, who has been neglected as Tom has sunk into hell.</p><p>In novels including Gone So Long, Townie and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-19-et-turan19-story.html">House of Sand and Fog</a>, Dubus excels at showing how mistakes can compound into tragedy. Rarely</p>,<p> in his work</p>,<p> is change the consequence of a single decision. A transformation is less like a tidal wave and more like a pattern, a cycle, which adds deposits or erodes the fragile coastline one grain of sand at a time. In Such Kindness, Toms story shows how gradual change can break a man  or build him back up.</p><p>First, Dubus brilliantly captures the ways chronic pain erodes the self. The pain is solipsistic, demanding such constant attention that it takes control over a brain tasked with monitoring it. It makes you irresponsible. </p>Responsible  <p>The ability to </p>respond<p>, Dubus writes. To the tasks and duties expected of you. To the hunger your wife has for a home in which to raise this baby you made from love.  To respond to your hopes. To your </p>childs <p>hopes.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/21/ce/7a48509f41fb80b98815a938a5b5/9781324000464.jpg"></figure><p>Tom hobbles through a world he fails to see. He only sees the liquor store where he soothes his pain. The beauty salon where the owner allows him to use her phone. He listens through the walls as his neighbor yells at her kids and her boyfriend yells at her. He clocks the middle-aged son who occasionally checks on his elderly mother. He watches as the man across the street works two jobs trying to get his wife and kids out of their unsafe neighborhood. He watches and he stews.</p><p>For working-class men who work with their hands and bodies, the loss of physical abilities may be obliterating. Capitalism demands our labor from early adulthood to death. So what is a man if he cannot work? Tom defends capitalism when Jamey says that property is theft. I ask him where he heard that Marxist b. Its not b. And it wasnt <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-jones-free-trade-protectionism-karl-marx-20170215-story.html">Karl Marx</a>, its some French anarchist dude. These are the kinds of discussions we once expected to hear in a working-mans club or a union hall before we were informed that the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-10-07/tankersley-riches-of-this-land-review">white working class</a> was a monolith ensorcelled by Trump. In this case, Tom is not quite ready to hear it.</p><p>Instead, he focuses on all that his injury has cost him. Nevertheless, his natural instinct is to help others  including Trina, when she is threatened by her ex  and to resort to his old toolkit of masculinity. His macho posturing is maladapted, only escalating Trinas troubles and sending him back to his couch.</p><p>But Dubus is no fatalist; we are on a difficult journey of redemption. A series of small events leads to a series of tiny realizations. But there is no straight path, no Christian epiphany, only an agonizing upward spiral. Smooth patches of progress hit speed bumps and unexpected corkscrew turns. Tom is forced to pay attention to something other than his hips, his broken pelvis, only to get distracted again.</p><p>What he begins to notice is that his troubles are not unique. An elderly neighbor is lonely. A young mother needs help with her kids. A friend dies and his widow needs comforting. His son is floundering and needs to be pulled from drowning. Small cracks where the light shows him that all of us need help.</p><p>It reminded me of <a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/btg/btg85.htm">the Parable of the Mustard Seed</a>, in which a woman demanded that the Buddha bring her child back to life. He promised to do so only if she could bring back mustard seeds from a family that had never suffered loss. And so she discovers that everyone has suffered and grief is not exclusive to her.</p><p>But even this will not be enough. Moments of charity border on martyrdom as Tom begins to think that his empathy has become another power to exercise. In his efforts to help, he overextends himself. He has more lessons to learn.</p><p>In a culture in which men are taught from an early age to overpower any obstacle, to ignore their feelings, to control a problem rather than surrender to it, to talk but not to listen, it would be easy to mock a novel about a man who chooses empathy. Dubus probes at masculinitys wounds, its core beliefs about earning money as a means of caring for others, and exposes the selfishness and emptiness at its core.</p><p>Tom becomes, then, an alternative model of masculinity. To figure out his place in this community, he will have to make himself vulnerable and soft rather than brittle and mean. Dubus, meanwhile, models this vulnerability by risking earnestness inside of a literary culture that rewards the armor of irony. He reminds me of Rilke, who wrote to a young poet about how he needed to be patient, to learn the lessons of pain. To recognize that the paralysis of suffering deafens us to our own emotions. Such Kindness is an astonishing novel about all these feelings, and the actions they call forth when we pay attention.</p>Berry writes for a number of publications and tweets&nbsp;<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BerryFLW?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">@BerryFLW</a></p>.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Thats the gist of journalist <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-variety-tv-critic-goes-public-alleged-assault-20171018-story.html">Maureen Ryan</a>s new book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/7748/9780063269279">Burn It Down</a>: Power: Complicity, and a Call to Change for Hollywood, a partial overview of cretinous and sometimes felonious behavior in the TV business. Culprits include the usual suspects  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-14/harvey-weinstein-will-not-be-retried-on-rape-charges-in-los-angeles">Harvey Weinstein</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-04-27/scott-rudin-steps-back-hollywood-broadway-skylight-consequences">Scott Rudin</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-11-02/paramount-cbs-moonves-pay-million-ny-ag-settlement">Les Moonves</a>, but Ryan adds to the scroll of shame alleged miscreants such as Horatio Sanz, Carlton Cuse and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-12-12/hbo-watchmen-regina-king-damon-lindelof-lost-critics">Damon Lindelof</a>, as well as Sleepy Hollow executive producer Len Wiseman and showrunner/executive producer Mark Goffman, among others.</p><p>Sanz was accused of grooming and sexually assaulting an underage </p> "SNL" fan intern<p> when he was a cast</p>-<p> member</p> at SNL<p>, in a case <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/entertainment/horatio-sanz-lawsuit-dismissed/index.html" target="_blank">settled last year</a>. Lost showrunners Cuse and Lindelof are accused of overseeing a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/05/lost-tv-show-culture" target="_blank">frat-like writers room</a> fueled by racist and sexist humor, and ignoring comments from Black cast member <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/show-tracker/story/2007-07-25/michaels-return-harold-perrineau-gets-lost-again">Harold Perrineau</a> about representation. Wiseman and Goffman are alleged to have targeted Sleepy Hollows Black co</p> -<p>star <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2020-06-19/nicole-beharie-miss-juneteenth">Nicole Beharie</a> with an ugly whisper campaign.</p><p>These are just some of the highlights from Ryans breathless compendium of malfeasance, which provides a valuable service in giving voice to those who have long gone unheard. But in placing sexual assault allegations alongside complaints from writers about being sidelined, her book risks diminishing the former.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/50/b0/2e90fb8549dea838adb12234a7f5/burn-it-down-jacket-image.jpg"></figure><p>Insofar as these behaviors are connected, they might be considered symptoms of a fundamental gap between how Hollywood works and how many, including Ryan, feel it should work. Even while acknowledging that the entertainment industry is autocratic, she applies democratic notions of fairness, a concept commonly trampled within organizations driven only by profit. Sometimes in democracies people have recourse against those who abuse power. Not in autocracies. And sometimes in democracies, bad guys lose at the polls. Not in autocracies.</p><p>Most new transgressions cited in Ryans book are not unlawful, leaving those who feel mistreated little or no recourse. Sure, there are avenues by which complaints can be lodged, but the power structure usually sides with successful showrunners over writers and actors. Human-resources procedures and other safeguards are primarily invested in quashing or avoiding controversy so as not to tie up production. None of it is right, but it should not come as a surprise when the underdog loses.</p><p>The books first part consists of chapters titled with various myths to be debunked: The Myth of Necessary <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-04-24/our-monsters-ourselves-claire-dederer-explains-her-sympathy-for-the-canceled">Monsters</a>, The Myth of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kaplan-inequality-race-20190709-story.html">Meritocracy</a>, The Toxic Myth of Creativity and so on. Here</p> ,<p> Ryan sharply targets an array of institutions and ideas, including the overriding myth of the genius (a book could be written on the misuse of the word), who in Hollywood often assumes the shape of a jackass, usually white and male. The geniuses say and do offensive things while enablers look the other way  a price purportedly worth paying for art.</p><p>The second part of Burn </p> I<p>t Down offers solutions. Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg shares advice for offenders on being better and seeking redemption. Psychologist Bo Travis suggests ways for offenders to identify their personal shortcomings and correct them. Also on hand is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/story/2023-05-02/photos-hollywood-writers-out-on-the-picket-lines">Kyra Jones</a>, an activist filmmaker who provides hints of what restorative justice might look like. The catch is that showrunners who are successful despite their repugnant behavior have no incentive to change.</p><p>And contrary to what wed like to believe, an unhealthy atmosphere on a production is not necessarily a formula for failure. Look no further than classics such as Titanic, The Birds or, back in the silent era, Erich von Stroheims masterpiece, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-dec-03-ca-39909-story.html">Greed</a>, on which scenes were shot during the summer in Death Valley and technicians dropped like flies.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c5/af/9f5d4bd44275bad33b744de21e82/afp-getty-2019-summer-tca-press-tour-day-2.JPG"></figure><p>Cuse wrote to Ryan that he </p> deniesdoesnt remember <p>saying the noxious things attributed to him. Lindelof maintains he has no recollection of the toxic incidents described in the book, adding that they took place roughly 17 years ago. In fact</p> ,<p> most of the transgressions cited occurred before #TimesUp and #MeToo. While no one believes a few hashtags fixed endemic abuse in Hollywood, it seems odd not to focus on current offenders in support of an argument that nothing has changed. That said, as Ryan told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/burn-it-down-industry-silence-allegations-book-goals-1235505435/">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, past offenders are still active in the industry.</p><p>The entertainment business has always been abusive. Those who run it exercise great power over those who will put up with nearly anything in pursuit of their dream. Stronger unions could provide safer guardrails, but that would require organizations like the WGA to target some of their high-profile members. Such a course, as reported in the book, would undermine the guilds unity.</p><p>Ryans solution to the rot and corruption is found in the title of her book: Burn it down. It sounds radical</p> ,<p> but she doesnt really mean it. In a section under that heading</p> ,<p> she writes about the regenerative qualities a wildfire has on the forest, clearing away brush and enriching the soil. Terrific, but what would be the mechanism by which a successful and profitable entertainment industry would be dismantled and rebuilt?</p><p>A veteran TV reporter and contributing editor at Vanity Fair, Ryan employs a conversational, bloggy writing style, revealing personal details that have little to do with Hollywood abuses. What does feel relevant is her experience being <a href="https://variety.com/2017/tv/columns/harvey-weinstein-sexual-assault-me-too-television-hollywood-1202591406/">assaulted by a TV exec</a>, which gets a mere fragment of a sentence here but was discussed in full in a 2017 article in Variety. Maybe she feels shes said all she can and has no interest in rehashing her trauma, but a little more about her personal stake in fixing abuses might have made her argument even more pointed and emotionally resonant.</p><p>Burn It Down further pulls back a curtain of silence thats already half</p> -<p>open, but never seems to come fully undone. And while it isnt likely to be a game</p> -<p>changer, any forum that gives voice to the voiceless is a valuable one.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

and angry staff stunned by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-07/los-angeles-times-newsroom-layoffs-merida-soon-shiong">announcement of 73 layoffs</a>, Los Angeles Times Executive Editor Kevin Merida on Thursday accepted responsibility for making really difficult decisions that led to dramatic cuts to the newsroom. </p><p>The organization is </p> cutting<p> photojournalists, longtime copy editors, news desk editors who help oversee the papers digital report and audience engagement editors. Audio producers were let go, as were a library researcher and several respected managers, including two stalwarts in the Spanish-language Times en Espaol digital news operation.</p><p>Its terrible. I feel awful about it but when youre a leader you have moments like this, Merida told more than 550 members of the papers staff during a Zoom meeting. Well be losing a lot of very valuable people and that's just really hard to take. Its hard for me, too.</p><p>The cuts represent the first significant belt-tightening since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-patrick-soon-shiong-latimes-sold-20180616-story.html">Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and his wife, Michele, paid $500 million to rescue The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune</a> from Chicago-based Tribune Publishing five years ago. Since then, the Soon-Shiong family has invested tens of millions of dollars in</p>to<p> The Times to bolster its journalism and cover revenue shortfalls that have continued each year during their stewardship.</p><p>The Times was making strides toward its profitability goals until COVID-19 pandemic closures in 2020 decimated advertising.</p> Executives initially announced 74 layoffs, but the number was reduced by one on Thursday after a team leader volunteered to go.&nbsp; The Times' contraction This weeks job cuts<p> unfolded against a broader backdrop of a newspaper industry in an existential crisis</p>, prompting that has prompted<p> dozens of newspapers to fold. Newspapers are starving for advertising revenue, which is being raked in by internet giants, including Google, Facebook and TikTok.</p>While  Although<p> The Times doesnt make its finances public, Merida acknowledged </p> that<p> the operation still relies heavily on revenue generated from its printed newspaper </p> at a time <p>of steady print subscriber declines.</p><p>And digital revenue has fallen well short of the levels needed to sustain the largest newsroom in the </p>western  Western<p> U.S.</p><p>Merida said The Times was facing a budget gap of tens of millions of dollars, which prompted the decision to cut dozens of staff members.</p><p>How can we figure out how to make our business self-sustaining, which is what we have to do, Merida said. Were dealing with structural problems in our industry and holes that cannot be easily filled.</p><p>The nearly two-hour session was </p> tenserough<p>.</p><p>Members of the newsroom union, Los Angeles Times Guild, already frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiating a new labor agreement to replace the one that expired in November, said they felt betrayed that management opted for layoffs before first offering buyouts to encourage staff members to voluntarily depart.</p>   "We've been evaluating the budget, in real time, since the beginning of the year, and trying to create savings, trying to do things to prevent what is happening now," Merida said. "It's on management to make that difficult decision. I want to own the toughness of that, and [not] put that on anybody else." <p>There was deep dismay that managers  who have been under fire for years over their </p> level of <p>commitment to newsroom diversity  had proposed cutting so many people of color.</p> The departures include d 34 white people and 39 people of color: 19 Latino people, 11 Asian American people,  4    four  Black people and  5    five  employees who identify as two or more races.<p>This is a setback for us, Merida acknowledged, noting that management was forced to follow the rules of the labor contract, which requires that layoffs be based on seniority.</p><p>Diversity is always important. We need to look at it in every context of our work Thats been a life</p>-<p>long commitment for me, throughout my entire journalism career, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-03/kevin-merida-latimes-executive-editor-espn-undefeated">Merida joined The Times two years ago </a>after several years at ESPN, running the </p>the <p>award-winning division formerly known as The Undefeated that plumbed the intersection of race, culture and sports.</p><p>He spent more than two decades as a respected reporter then senior editor at the Washington Post, which he grew up reading as a youth in Maryland.</p><p>Staff members were upset about the number of Asian American and Latino employees who were let go. The papers only two Spanish-speaking photojournalists were initially&nbsp;included in the cuts, which would have left the photo department without a fluent Spanish speaker in a region that is more than 50% Latino. </p>   Late Thursday, after an unidentified manager volunteered to leave, one of the Spanish-speaking photographers was reinstated. <p>Reporters  viewed as the beating heart of the organization  were largely spared. So were the senior-most editors who make up the newspapers so-called masthead. Several reporters wondered why a few of the newsrooms top earners were not included.</p><p>No one from the masthead? asked investigative reporter Matt Hamilton. The masthead is the biggest </p> that<p> its been since I worked here.</p><p>During the meeting, reporters expressed frustration over Merida's responses to multiple questions, which they felt didn't go far enough&nbsp;or were evasive.&nbsp;</p> They demanded to know&nbsp; including why so many of the layoffs concentrated on audience engagement editors and web producers who work closely with reporters to build digital audiences for their stories.<p>"Kevin, you said in your letter that you want us to be a next-generation digital powerhouse," said Arit John, a national reporter based in Washington. "But how do we do that with ... no audio team, with </p> a<p> decimated audience team and a skeleton crew on the copy desk? These are critical roles."</p><p>Merida responded that not all copy editors</p>,<p> or news desk or audience team members were cut, and that there would still be people filling those roles.</p><p>The Times gave the 56 guild members 30-day notices. During the next two weeks, other staff members who were not on the list of layoffs can volunteer to take a buyout, which would spare a colleague on the list for the cuts. </p><p>But for more than a dozen non-guild members who received </p> termination  notices they had been terminated<p>, Wednesday was their last day.</p><p>Some speakers became emotional, including journalist Ameera Butt, who was part of the news desk team overseeing the website 24/7 and </p> handling <p>news alerts.</p>   She said that she was working an overnight shift last year in the days leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and made a speedy decision to publish a story to keep readers informed.     She said her team was integral to making the internet operation more vital to readers  . She said that she was the overnight news editor during Russias invasion of Ukraine, and said her team was integral to making the Internet  internet operation more vital to readers<p>.</p><p>I feel incredibly disappointed in management, Butt said. It's been awful. It's been blindsiding, it's been a shock because I personally love the L.A. Times and I loved working for you guys and ... thats gone.</p><p>Merida told her that he was sorry.</p><p>Sorry doesnt work in this situation, Butt said.</p> After the meeting, Merida acknowledged "it has been a difficult two days for our newsroom. I still love our place. Every day, I plan to come to work and do the best I can as a leader.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

No </p>set <p>decision has been made on </p> an<p> ad-supported tier, the Journal said.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment. </p>Rob Enderle, a principal analyst at advisory services firm Enderle Group, called the discussions it an "additive revenue opportunity.""Advertisers right now, in terms of getting streaming viewers are very limited, because a lot of the streaming viewers are paying a subscription to get away from ads," Enderle said, adding, advertisers are "more than happy to pay for ads.""They're going after an audience that doesn't want to spend as much money for streaming and appears willing to watch ads," Enderele said. "They want to get that ad revenue as opposed to having to go to somebody else." If it goes through with the plan,  Amazon Prime  Video , known for shows including "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," would join a long - list of streaming companies that offer ad-supported options to attract subscribers and retain existing customers.<p>Last year, Netflix launched a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-10-13/lat-et-ct-netflix-ad-supported-plan-streaming">cheaper plan with ads</a>, after years of being adverse to advertising on its platform.

The tech giant generated $9.5 billion in advertising services </p> during<p> the first quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. </p> Rob Enderle, a principal analyst at advisory services firm Enderle Group, called the potential ad-supported streaming tier an "additive revenue opportunity." "They're going after an audience that doesn't want to spend as much money for streaming and appears willing to watch ads," Ender ele said. "They want to get that ad revenue as opposed to having to go to somebody else."Ross Benes, a principal analyst with Insider Intelligence, said that in recent years Prime Video has "gotten more aggressive" about running promos prior for its other shows  ahead of its programming. ad-filled sports broadcasts. "Officially putting ads into Prime Video allows Amazon to centralize its audience and be more consistent with branding," Benes said. "It wouldnt be surprising if they eventually folded Freevee into Prime Video or shuttered it ... It has struggled to stand out in a crowded field of free services. Having one unified streaming service with various tiers would simplify Amazons streaming products for consumers and advertisers." <p>Additional revenue would help the company pay for its programming.

In this case, an iconic low-income housing complex in Phnom Penh that had outlasted Khmer Rouge purges when government workers lived there, and in later disrepair became a haven for artists, but which wasnt cut out to survive the 21st century pace of modern city gentrification.</p><p>Even if you didnt know Neang grew up in this historic location, which the filmmaker captured in its last days for a 2019 documentary (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2019-08-27/cambodia-independent-film">Last Night I Saw You Smiling</a>), something intensely personal emanates from his doleful tale of a teenage boy named </p> Samnang (Piseth Chhun)<p> coming to grips with the displacement of his family, the limits of tradition, and a turning point for his sense of self.</p><p>Kind-eyed and ambitious, young Samnang is a hip-hop dancer in a performing trio with his best pals and building mates </p> Ah Kha (Chinnaro    Soem     Some),<p> a handsome brooder, and easygoing </p> Tol (Sovann Tho).<p> Readying themselves for an upcoming competition, they make the most of a pulsating Phnom Penh nightlife to dance for donations, marvel at the citys colors, sounds and mouthwatering aromas, and talk girls and dreams.</p><p>At home, however, where the buildings decrepit condition goes unattended, its reality with an expiration date, which has created an atmosphere of stifling pressure. Samnangs dad </p> (Sithan Hout), imbd and rottentomatoes have it wrong/doug<p> a sculptor and retired government employee with a passive mien, represents the residents in their negotiations with the company eager to force them out. But his sleepy optimism for a miracle renewal isnt holding this worried, angry, and fearful bunch together; many dwellers are scared about where theyll be able to afford to live (certainly not in Phnom Penh anymore), but ready to bail with a guaranteed check.</p><p>A misplaced faith in old ways also doesnt bode well for the black toe that Samnangs diabetic dad wont get medically treated, preferring painkillers, honey, tamarind, and a wait-and-see approach. You could argue a rotting toe is a tad on-the-nose for a visual tied to a story about decay. (The movie was written by Neang and </p> Daniel Mattes<p>.) But Neangs trust in perspective, cinematographer Douglas Seoks evocative imagery, and the meditative strengths of slow cinema, end up complementing this narrative element. The toe becomes a signal to Samnang, as much to us, of greater wounds in need of addressing. Later, when Samnangs father enters one of his dreams, its a figure in a dank, dark hallway, standing tall in a nice suit, but then turning and walking away, becoming smaller and smaller.</p><p>One of the co-producers of White Building is filmmaker <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-jia-zhangke-director-ash-is-the-purest-white-20190318-story.html">Jia Zhangke</a>, and its a show of support that immediately makes cosmic sense  you can feel the connection between Neangs semiautobiographical, fully poetic act of mourning about a fast-changing Cambodia and the Chinese masters vivid epics about the upheavals transforming his own country. Its there in the emptied spaces and tableaus of construction, in the contrast between a citys buzzy new vibe and its quieter, alienated corners, and in the idea that through development projects such as these, history, too, is being cleared away with each brick, packing box</p>,<p> and evacuee.</p><p>Theres an incredible, heavy tracking shot toward the end of Neangs movie I can only imagine came from the White Buildings final days  it follows along the rundown faade until it reaches one end, where a demolition crane is picking away like a big, hungry praying mantis. Its a shot without his characters, perhaps because it came from Neangs documentary footage before White Building described a movie, but</p>not<p> just a place where people lived until 2017. But in this context, the shot sure does feel like something out of his young alter egos head: a towering home, but also a heavy memory, one as susceptible as a neglected structure or forgotten soul to being chipped at or leveled. Movies like these, one realizes, are why people pick up cameras.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Im also a massage-at-the-mall person.</p><p>Lewis, whose talent and effortless charm have made her an object of fascination since her days fronting the beloved early-2000s indie-rock band Rilo Kiley, pursues these activities at the Opry Mills shopping center in Nashville, where the lifelong Angeleno bought a second home in 2017. Opry Mills also boasts a mediocre Mexican chain restaurant, per Lewis description, called Chuys, which shes heard inspired the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BamaU09AdGA&amp;ab_channel=PurpleMountains-Topic" target="_blank">Margaritas at the Mall</a> by the Silver Jews <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-08-12/david-berman-appreciation-thomas-beller">David Berman</a>, a poet and songwriting hero of Lewis who died in 2019.</p><p>So in addition to the mall walking and the massages, shell sometimes throw her black cockapoo in her Chevy Colorado  the stars of her own song Puppy and a Truck  and hit Chuys for an afternoon drink on the patio.</p><p>You know, she says, in honor of Berman.</p><p>Finding happiness where perhaps you least expect it  thats one of the secrets of life that Lewis, 47, explores on her enchanting new album, JoyAll, which puts her sweet, sly voice over funky and laid-back country-rock arrangements that split the difference between the musical traditions of her two hometowns. Recorded in Nashville with producer Dave Cobb (known for his work with Chris Stapleton and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-10-11/brandi-carlile-joni-mitchell-grammys-2023">Brandi Carlile</a>), the LP follows a series of personal losses for Lewis, including her mother, who died in 2019; a couple of show-business mentors in film-music editor Jerry Cohen and album-cover designer Gary Burden; and her social life for much of the year 2020, which she spent isolated </p>by herself<p> at her place in the Studio City hills thanks to a history of serious childhood asthma that left her especially vulnerable to COVID.</p><p>Yet JoyAll exults in having survived hardship to inherit the wisdom of middle age. My 40s are kicking my ass / And handing em to me in a margarita glass, she sings against a shuffling groove in Puppy and a Truck; later, the jazzy-soulful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVHTG3YbQWg&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">The Essence of Life</a> defines that elusive state as both suffering and ecstasy.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv8aibmIqag&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewis<p>Lewis new album also comes as shes embraced her role as a kind of godmother to a younger generation (or two) of rock artists, many of them women, writing with wit and acuity about the details of their emotional lives.</p><p>Without Jenny Lewis theres no <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-04-07/phoebe-bridgers-coachella">Phoebe Bridgers</a>, theres no Soccer Mommy, theres no <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2023-04-03/boygenius-the-record-phoebe-bridgers-julien-baker-lucy-dacus">Boygenius</a>, says Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie, whos been close with Lewis since he recruited her to sing background vocals on Give Up, the 2003 debut by his electro-pop side project, the Postal Service.</p><p>Curled in an armchair at home in Studio City  her little dog, Bobby Rhubarb, tucked next to her  Lewis smiles when asked on a recent afternoon how that hallowed position makes her feel.</p><p>Stoked, she says. And old. The sound of vintage reggae drifts from a cassette boombox in the kitchen; out back by the pool are dozens of small stones Lewis hand-painted during the pandemic to evoke Salvation Mountain near the Salton Sea. Once you realize youre at the age where not only can you write a memoir but you can be a mentor, thats a pretty big moment, says Lewis, whos wearing gold corduroys and a Grand Royal Records sweatshirt, her long red hair beneath a beat-up ball cap. I do consider myself a pioneer. But a lot of these women that have looked up to my music, theyve eclipsed my record sales or my streaming numbers, if you pay attention to that s.</p><p>Indeed, theres something of an underground-legend quality to Lewis, whose many other admirers include Katie Crutchfield of Waxahatchee and the L.A. sister trio Haim, whose Danielle Haim once played guitar in Lewis live band. The singer has been thinking lately about the things that didnt quite happen in her career to bring real-deal pop stardom  like Rilo Kileys buzzy 2004 single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn7Ldn7liGU&amp;ab_channel=RiloKiley-Topic" target="_blank">Portions for Foxes</a> not becoming an actual hit, as she puts it, or the time the band was in the running for a coveted performance on Saturday Night Live in 2007 only to see the show go dark amid that years Hollywood writers strike.</p><p>That mightve changed the course of history for us, she says of the SNL spot. But I actually wouldnt change anything. Not being on SNL kind of led me to this moment where Im in control of my art on every level.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/30/8d/9ec4c5d847fea662bcf1f6901a25/gettyimages-1495842848.jpg"></figure><p>In a funny twist, the serenely satisfied JoyAll  Lewis fifth solo album and her first for the venerable Blue Note label  could be one to expand Lewis audience. On the road in 2021 she played in front of hundreds of thousands of potential new fans as Harry Styles opening act. The demand for a Rilo Kiley reunion seems to grow louder with every year. Even Lana Del Rey wrote a song about her, or so Lewis is pretty sure: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN0OmdJUl0I&amp;ab_channel=LanaDelReyVEVO" target="_blank">Blue Banisters</a>, Im assuming Im the Jenny that jumped into a pool, she says of a line from the title track of Del Reys 2021 LP.</p><p>A friend of mine was staying in the back house, Lewis explains, nodding through a set of glass doors, and Lana came to visit. We were hanging out and swimming, and throughout our conversation, she was sort of speaking into her voice notes [on her phone]. Later, she texted me  like, Hey, do you mind if I use this in a song? Our conversation had made its way into her song, which is very beautiful. (Among Lewis other high-profile pals is Jimmy Buffett, with whose family shes vacationed. The Buffetts really know how to do it, she says. Even if youre not a beach-y person, they make you get in the water every day.)</p><p>Don Was, the Grammy-winning producer and Blue Note president, says Lewis is pretty blas about pop stardom. Shes not doing stupid s like chasing Justin Bieber." But, he adds, Jennys a very savvy person. She wants to reach people with her music.</p><p>Says Gibbard: Ive always gotten the sense that a spirit of anti-fame fame is appealing to her.</p><p>Lewis was born in Las Vegas, where her parents performed in casinos as a lounge act; her mom and dad split when she was 3, and her mom took her and her older sister to Van Nuys. Lewis spent the 80s working on sets: a Jell-O commercial, a gig on Growing Pains, a role playing Shelley Longs daughter in Troop Beverly Hills. Her memories of those days are shaped by her complicated relationship with her mother, who was addicted to heroin and used Lewis earnings to buy drugs.</p><p>This is sort of embarrassing, but I wet the bed until I was 8 or 9, Lewis says. She remembers driving to an audition in her mothers copper-colored Honda Accord when she accidentally peed in the front seat. My mom was so mad at me. But I booked the job.</p><p>Lewis quit acting in her early 20s and formed Rilo Kiley with Blake Sennett, a fellow child actor.</p>;t<p>The band, which flexed an encyclopedic knowledge of rock history in tunes about ambition, sex and depression, spent a decade creeping right up to the big time before drifting apart around 2011. By the time she was 40, Lewis had solidly established herself as a solo act adored by in-the-know millennials and classic rockers alike.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/89/02/8264a7d749c9b80cbedabfa3b722/gettyimages-86104556.jpg"></figure><p>Yet shed also broken up with her longtime boyfriend, singer-songwriter Johnathan Rice, and decided it was time to get out of the Valley. So she went to New York, where she lived for two years in her friend Annie Clarks East Village apartment while Clark, who performs as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-08-26/st-vincent-audible-podcast-audiobook-words-and-music">St. Vincent</a>, lived in L.A. We Freaky Friday-ed, Lewis says. She and a couple of friends formed a scrappy, politically minded post-punk trio, Nice </p>A<p>as F, that played shows until late 2016, when one of the members was eight months pregnant. And then Trump got elected and the mood just shifted, says Lewis, who recalls election night in Clarks fifth-floor walk-up. You could hear the screams of the people in the building.</p><p>At the time, Lewis was dating someone who lived in Nashville and decided to give the town a try. Im not immersed in the music business there at all, she says. I can do a little cowgirl cosplay, which is fun. But ultimately Im not cut from that cloth. And according to the allergy test I took yesterday, Im allergic to horses.</p><p>Even so, shes enjoying educating herself on the history of country music. Shes been covering Keith Whitleys <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka_lJGRGPs8&amp;ab_channel=KeithWhitleyVEVO" target="_blank">Miami, My Amy</a> in concert; often shell drive out to the cemetery in suburban Hendersonville where Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash are buried. Theres also this guy Merle Kilgore, who wrote Ring of Fire,  she says. His headstone is so flashy  like, its totally upstaging Johnny and June. Its so Nashville, I love it.</p><p>Some of the songs on JoyAll came out of a virtual songwriting camp the musician Beck convened in early 2021 in which hed give the participants various prompts, such as Write a song using only clichs. (Lewis response to that one was the twanging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjklFFGL_Hc&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">Love Feel</a>, with its talk of fire and lightning and sugar in the gas tank.)</p><p>Lewis met </p> the producer <p>Cobb through her friends in the L.A. duo <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2022-04-11/lucius-brandi-carlile-harry-styles">Lucius</a>, who were in Nashville making their album Second Nature with Carlile. Lewis identifies the 60s country-pop star Skeeter Davis as a crucial influence on her new album, though its easy to hear Lindsey Buckingham in Psychos and Tom Petty in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAbvq5uwnDk&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO" target="_blank">Apples and Oranges</a>.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlNVtA6Lgu4&amp;ab_channel=JennyLewisVEVO<p>The LPs sound is considerably leaner than Lewis last few albums, which she attributes in part to the fact that she was trying to be COVID-cautious about how many people were in the studio at a given time. Says Cobb: I just love her voice so much that I wanted to make that the thing. To the producers ears, Lewis</p>s<p> singing has this ability to soothe even when shes writing about some really deep stuff, he adds. I hear real happiness in her voice on this record.</p><p>For her previous album, 2019s On the Line, Lewis hired Ryan Adams to produce  a decision she grew to regret when, just weeks before the record dropped, Adams was accused by several women of sexual misconduct. </p> (At the time, Adams denied the claims against him.) <p>Lewis said then that Adams didnt abuse her, though today shes still haunted by something he told her in the studio, which was, Enough of this campfire bulls,  she recalls. But this record is a return to that campfire bulls, because I want to be able to take my guitar and play these songs anywhere by myself.</p><p>A sense of self-sufficiency is important to Lewis in both her music and her life. In addition to Clark, she let other friends stay in her Studio City place while she was away, including a family with a newborn, which she thinks cleansed the house of whatever energy remained from her years there with Rice. Then I had to come back and go through s, she says. Its way sparser now. I got rid of all the pictures on the walls  they were all of Johnathan. She looks around the living room, which is virtually empty beyond a chair, a sofa and a marimba sitting in the corner. This is my space, and I love it. But Im really happy that I have the luxury of going back and forth between here and a new place  making new memories somewhere else, having new romantic experiences in a different bed.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e6/dc/572886534f5e8e82bab576543966/1295033-et-jenny-lewis-mrt-03.jpg"></figure><p>Lewis will spend much of this year on the road, playing festivals, headlining her own shows and opening arena dates for Beck and Phoenix (including an Aug. 7 stop at the Kia Forum) before joining Gibbard for a tour marking the 20th anniversary of the Postal Service album. (That tour will wrap in October with three nights at the Hollywood Bowl.)</p><p>For her current live band, which includes only women, I want to create an environment thats safe, fun, not too serious  but serious in the work, she says. I want to rehearse, and I want to get it right. Learning how to have these talks before you embark on a journey  like, Here are the ground rules  I think thats really positive.</p><p>Did the experience with Adams make her feel responsible for more closely vetting the people she works with? Yes, she replies. Im in charge of 12 people on tour  theyre my responsibility. Whatever behavior was going on in 2004 does not fly now. I mean, it didnt fly back then, and I was uncomfortable with a lot of stuff. Hooking up with random fans in the bunks? That sucks. I hate that.</p> With a sexy beat, Rilo Kiley tests the indie limits<p>Lewis doesnt want to get into the specifics of who was doing what in 2004. But its clear shes talking about some of the personality conflicts that eventually drove apart Rilo Kiley. And yet these days she seems more open to that longed-for reunion than she ever has.</p><p>Playing those songs together would be really fun, she says. Giving people the satisfaction of hearing songs that were a part of their formative high school experiences  thats a very special thing to provide. Its certainly something thats in our consciousness, and I think if the time is right in our relationships, then the music will be easy.</p><p>So: Coachella 2025?</p><p>I feel like thats, she says, trailing off with a laugh. I dont think 2024. For now shes willing to keep disappointing people by withholding what they want. Theyre always like, We miss how you were then!  she says.</p><p>One wonders if encountering that attitude makes her want to dig in her heels regarding Rilo Kiley.</p><p>Of course, Lewis says. Were never</p>,<p> ever</p>,<p> ever getting back together, to quote Taylor Swift. But thats not true. Im not a person who closes the door.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

We wish Jones all the best for the future." </p><p>Jones</p> , 51,<p> joined the "Wait and Bleed" hitmakers in 1996 and became recognized for his distinctive mask </p> featuring<p> dozens of metallic-looking spikes radiating from his head. </p> Neither Jones nor the band <p>has </p> indicated the reason for<p> his departure or </p> mentioned the percussionist's<p> future plans. </p> Fury Links System of a Down, Slipknot<p>A never-before-seen member appeared on stage with the band during the tour's opening show in Austria on Wednesday night. Following the performance, a photo of a new masked-and-hooded member debuted on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtNWusNP7PB/" target="_blank">Slipknot's Instagram page</a> with no caption. </p><p>Jones' announcement came after percussionist Shawn "Clown" Crahan stated that he would not be with the group in Europe so that he could care for his wife, Chantel, </p> who has chronic health issues. <p>On Wednesday morning, Crahan</p> , 53,<p> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CtLY5poOzxv/" target="_blank">shared a message</a> with fans on Slipknot's social pages. </p> Slipknot thrashes, takes five, thrashes, takes five and so on<p>"I would like to take a moment to tell everyone that Im back home supporting my wife through some health issues, and Ill be back on the road as soon as I can," he wrote. "Weve been through this before and as always, we appreciate the love and support. See all of you very soon." </p><p>It is currently unclear how long Crahan</p> , a founding member of Slipknot, <p>will be away from the band. Slipknot will be on tour in Europe through the end of June and then return stateside to play festivals in July and September. </p> Although he didn't offer details about his wife's health<p>, Crahan </p> spoke in 2005 to <p><a href="https://blabbermouth.net/news/slipknots-shawn-clown-crahan-to-sit-out-shows-on-spring-summer-2023-european-tour" target="_blank">     the Des Moines Register  </a></p> <p>about supporting her in her ongoing struggle with Crohn's disease. </p> Slipknot founding drummer Joey Jordison dies at 46<p>"That's the thing I fight for most in this biz, is family," he told his hometown paper. "Family can and is being incorporated into rock 'n' roll. You can have a wife, you can have a child or children and be a rock n' roller."</p><p>Crahan later mentioned in the interview that "health is the most important thing you have on this planet if you're gonna have a successful life." </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Whitaker, speaking from his New York City home, says, "Here's a guy who was a chess player, a poet, a philanthropist, a murderer and a drug dealer. We knew from the start he was complex, especially because we chose a time in Bumpy's life that reflects his day and our day as well."</p><p>The Epix/MGM+ series represents a deep, dark dive for Whitaker, who's been imagining himself as the real-life narcotics kingpin since 2018, when producers Markuann Smith and Jim Acheson first pitched him on bringing Bumpy Johnson to the small screen. "I told them I'd be interested in producing and possibly acting in the show depending on if it could serve as a prism to society today and reflect where we are right now through the characters and their world," Whitaker says. "The draft script from Chris Brancato and Paul Eckstein did that, so I decided to act in the project."</p><p>Season 3 begins in the wake of Harlem riots following the death of 15-year-old James Powell at the hands of an off-duty police officer. "Bumpy saw all his dreams go up in smoke in the riots, and now he's left with nothing," Whitaker says. "He gets thrown into a different world with the Cuban Mafia, the CIA, the FBI and the five [Mafia] families. It's a lot to navigate as an actor, because Bumpy has to change within this environment in order to succeed."</p><p>As an actor, Whitaker has successfully changed his own persona many times dating to his 1986 scene-stealing turn opposite Paul Newman in "The Color of Money." Additional to dozens of fictional characters, he portrayed a couple of real-life figures to thrilling effect. As jazz great Charlie Parker in Clint Eastwood's 1988 biopic "Bird," Whitaker learned to play saxophone and sometimes, he says, considered each note to be a different word as part of his character's personal expression. In 2007 he won an Oscar for playing Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in "The Last King of Scotland." For that role, Whitaker studied Barbet Schroeder's documentary about Amin and learned Swahili. </p><p>"When you create a real character, you have an arrow that points you to things you have to re-create," he says. "It's a different process for each character, but in some ways, it's the same. Slowly, slowly, a voice starts to happen. The way you stand, the way you growl, the way internal tension makes your voice more tense  it all starts to take hold of you and the character starts to form. But it was different for Bumpy."</p><p>Johnson had been mythologized in numerous movies, including <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-aug-27-ca-26159-story.html">"Hoodlum," starring Laurence Fishburne</a>, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-gangster2nov02-story.html">"American Gangster,"</a> featuring Denzel Washington as the gangster's successor. But when it came to original source material, Forest encountered a dearth of visual references. "Bumpy didn't like his photograph being taken," Whitaker explains. "He'd been a criminal from the 1930s through the late '60s, and there's only, like, four photographs of him."</p><p>To glean insights about the publicity-shy gangster, Whitaker spent time with Johnson's elderly driver and an enforcer named Junie Byrd. "The stories these guys told me, Bumpy was not afraid to get his hands dirty. If somebody needed to be killed, he was willing to take that on."</p><p>Whitaker also credits the show's wardrobe department with tailoring a sartorial identity befitting the gangster's self-concept. "We paid a lot of attention to the suits," Whitaker says. "At the start of the show, designer Domenico Vacca created these elegant but conservative suits for Bumpy. He doesn't flaunt anything. Bumpy's a businessman, almost like a banker, and it's rare that you see him out of a suit."</p>No matter how beautifully he dresses,<p> Johnson must contend with ugly competition from the Mafia, including crime boss Vincent D'Onofrio's "Chin" Gigante and Joe Colombo (Michael Raymond</p> -<p>James). Even as he's fending off the mob, Johnson's wife, Mayme (Ilfenesh Hadera ), pressures him to quit the business altogether. That's not going to happen, Whitaker says. "Joe Colombo makes him a good offer [to get out], but Bumpy refuses the deal. He says, 'When I leave these blocks, I'm treated like every other Black person, subjugated and humiliated. Here in Harlem, I have power.' Bumpy can't give that up." </p>Even though he's torn about what he does for a living, Bumpy wants to do it on his own. We watch him struggle with that throughout the season."<p>Unlike his Bumpy Johnson, who spits out his lines with dagger-like velocity, Whitaker speaks softly, pausing periodically to gather his thoughts. "By Season 3," he murmurs, "Bumpy's feeling tremendous frustration. It's like he's banging his head against the wall wanting to scream, feeling at times like a caged animal." Johnson's legendary temper fueled considerable violence, especially when a CIA operative forcibly injected his daughter Elise (Antoinette Crowe-Legacy) with heroin. </p><p>"That's truly war," Whitaker notes. "I have four kids, and their protection has always been a big goal in my life. If somebody were to do something like that to my daughter  incomprehensible. And I know people whose kids have been harmed by drugs. You feel weak, helpless. Bumpy's outraged, but he's also afraid of not being able to protect his daughters. I understand that from the bottom up."</p><p>While rage drives much of Johnson's behavior, Whitaker also reveals the gangster at his most vulnerable. During the season finale, Bumpy Johnson tearfully reckons with the assassination of his old friend and mentor Malcolm X. On the set that day, Whitaker recalls, "I found a quiet space. Dug up some emotional memories and thoughts. The scene was shot in a real morgue, so when I walked into the room, there he is on the table, a dead prince. It was quite a difficult scene to do, taking in this man who, for Bumpy, represented the freedom to stand tall and fight for what you believe in. There he is lying on a cold slab."</p><p>For a moment, it looks as if Johnson might have an epiphany and find some form of redemption. After all, Whitaker observes, "Malcolm X had hoped to convert Bumpy to being a good citizen inside of the community. He wanted Bumpy to leave behind his darker ways. But ultimately, [he goes] back to his reserve, being a criminal and saying: 'I'm going to avenge this. I'm going to take action.'"</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Ending there, the show would have been about karmic retribution. Instead, the second season transformed into a story of (some measure of) redemption. Even rebirth.</p><p>"If the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-12-04/your-honor-bryan-cranston-showtime-review">first season</a> was more 'King Lear,' then this season is more 'Hamlet,' where he truly doesn't want to live, in the beginning," says star and executive producer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/show-tracker/story/2010-03-30/bryan-cranstons-breaking-bad-breakthrough">Bryan Cranston</a>, who plays erstwhile respected New Orleans judge Michael Desiato in the Showtime drama. "By the end of the season, hopefully without being too on the nose, we wanted to give the audience the sense that Michael doesn't want to die anymore. That he [eventually becomes] reconnected to humanity enough to shift into, at least, neutral."</p><p>As the series begins, Michael is forced to make life-or-death decisions on the fly when his son, Adam (Hunter Doohan), inadvertently kills a motorcyclist in a traffic accident. When the victim turns out to be the son of a ruthless underworld figure, Michael moves to cover up Adam's involvement  triggering a lethal and ever-widening butterfly effect that destroys several lives, including Adam's, Michael's and an entire innocent family's.</p><p>Cranston says. "I've asked [people], 'What would </p>you<p> do to save the life of your child?' And the answer is, 'Anything.' The next question: 'Would you knowingly become a criminal?' 'Yes, I would.' Then the third question: 'Would you allow an innocent person harm or death?' And that stops people cold. And that's where we are with the show."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c2/a4/c5d877de4f91985ad47b1dbd86bb/your-honor-cranston-201-23028-r-bd291bbd03012feb.jpg"></figure><p>The pitch-dark drama's first season finds Michael doing things he never could have imagined in order to maintain the rickety framework of lies keeping his son alive. His actions are as grand as subverting a trial to keep the mobster's other son out of prison and as small-but-despicable as blurting out to the woman he's dating he loves her simply to distract her from witnessing one of the cogs of his plan. Then, after his own son becomes collateral damage, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4XHSk_KICY" target="_blank">Season 2</a> finds the devastated former judge in prison, not talking or eating</p>; <p> just wasting away. </p><p>The actor says</p>, that<p> though creator Peter </p>Sollett Moffat<p> was unable to return as showrunner for the second season due to family issues, they had intended a two-season arc from the start. The second season was to depict Michael's long, slow crawl back to life. </p><p>"I wanted to incrementally, subtly show there are things that are connected to being human, that he forgot about or he stumbles upon until we know [he's no longer suicidal], without having him say, 'Hey, I think I'd like to live now.'</p> " <p>Cranston and Season 2 showrunner <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-shock-and-awe-review-20180426-story.html">Joey Hartstone</a> agreed Michael should be "a man who wants to die; </p> h<p>e's not motivated to do anything." Indeed, it's only threats to those he cares about that force him out of his death spiral. In taking action, he inches toward redemption. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/a3/ff/8341bd644ca09bd570ce0581fa4e/1277150-env-0404-bryan-cranston-your-honor-cmh-10.jpg"></figure><p>"It was a tribute to Showtime to allow that second season to" be so dark and to take its time, Cranston says. "I reminded them where this is going. It's not going to be a first</p> <p>episode</p>,<p> 'Michael Desiato gets his mojo back, overcomes his anguish and his deep despair over the loss of his son, and here he is, back!' No, it's the entire season.</p><p>"I wanted to be true to that. I think if I lost my child, it would change me as a human being. I could not live the same way. My relationship with my wife would be challenging and different, and with friends ... I just can't imagine it being anything like what it was.</p><p>"The other thing that I was interested in playing this season was the power of apology, of asking forgiveness. And it's a two-way street. The courage to ask forgiveness, and also the courage to</p> grant<p> forgiveness. It's not a weakness if someone can identify their own personal weakness; that's enlightenment. 'I've wronged, I've hurt someone, and I need to make amends for that.' "</p><p>True, he finds a way to be useful in the end, using his expertise to save one of the victims of his collateral damage, but it's the carefully planned details that really tell the story of Michael Desiato in Season 2. </p><p>The key vehicle of rebirth is a near-literal one: </p> t<p>he revelation that Adam had conceived a child with his girlfriend before he died. Michael doesn't feel worthy of connecting with the baby and his mother. He can't even bring himself to pet his beloved dog. Over the course of many episodes, he comes to hold the baby, even feed it. The increments are as small as him giving his dog a spoonful of peanut butter.</p><p>"Where do I put the spoon to put the lid back on? I just shove it in my mouth. And I take a moment: 'Oh, my God. Peanut butter.' It's not a big thing, but it's those little things  the little joyous moments that we take for granted  seeing a dog, seeing a baby, tasting peanut butter. These little things no one would write about, but if we see glimpses of these with him, then we know that he is, even involuntarily, reconnecting to humanity."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The road had been closed for weeks </p> due to <p>roadway damage</p>s<p> left by the multiple storms of last winter. </p><p>Two other crucial park roads (both of which close every winter) have yet to open.</p><p>The snows have forced many changes and delays as the park</p>s<p> gears up for summer. The cables that climbers use to summit Half Dome, for instance, usually are put in place in May, but that hasn't happened yet. (While Highway 120 has been closed, Bay Area visitors have been reaching the park via Highway 140, a detour of roughly 30 miles.)</p><p>Though the reopening of Big Oak Flat Road doesnt change northbound driving directions for most visitors from Southern California  who enter the park by way of Oakhurst and Highway 41  it is likely to ease traffic circulation in the park. And it means visitors can follow loop itineraries, entering from the south entrance and returning by way of the west entrance.</p><p>Today, </p>June 9,<p> the park is </p>also <p>starting summer shuttle service on Mariposa Grove Road. That service takes visitors from Mariposa Grove Welcome Plaza  near the park's south entrance  to Mariposa Grove, home to more than 500 giant sequoia trees. (The road from the plaza to the trees is open only to shuttle buses and private vehicles with disability placards.)</p><p>Meanwhile, road crews are working toward summer openings for Glacier Point Road and Tioga Road, but because of lingering snow and construction</p>s<p>, dates remain uncertain.</p><p>Glacier Point Road is expected to open "no earlier than July, probably later," Yosemite's website reports. This is the seasonal route that gives visitors access to </p> the <p>classic view of Half Dome from Glacier Point, about 7,200 feet above sea level and 3,200 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley. Glacier Point Road was closed all last summer for construction. Even after reopening, rangers say, 30-minute delays are likely at first.</p><p>The opening date also remains unknown for the parks most popular seasonal route, Tioga Road, which connects Yosemite to the Owens Valley near Lee Vining and Mono Lake. Tioga Road, snowbound in winter, often opens in May or June after mild winters, June or July after snowy ones. But this years heavy Sierra snowpack  244% of normal on April 1  has rangers reluctant to make any prediction for this summer.</p><p>Another factor for summer travelers to weigh</p>t<p>: Yosemite Valley may be unusually crowded this summer, especially on weekends. This is the first time in four years that the park hasnt required advance booking for summertime day-tripper visits to the valley. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Find ideas and inspiration on where to go, what to eat and how to enjoy life on the weekends.<p>Many know Jaren Lewison as nerdy high-schooler Ben, whose relationship with classmate Devi went from frenemies to lovers on Netflixs <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-05-06/netflix-never-have-i-ever-mindy-kaling-immigrant-los-angeles">Never Have I Ever</a>. But off-screen, Lewison is a recent graduate of USC who loves to bake, play video games, hit the gym, eat like a king and wander around nostalgic places. </p><p>"Sometimes you become slightly desensitized to how magical [L.A.] can feel, said Lewison, who still lives in South Central near the USC campus after finishing school a year early. </p><p>With "Never Have I Ever" returning for its fourth and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-03-08/never-have-i-ever-netflix-season-4-mindy-kaling">final</a> season this week,</p>JUNE 8<p> Lewison takes us through some of the spots he's enjoyed with his friends and the show's cast and crew. Heres how hed spend a perfect Sunday in L.A.</p><p><b>9:30 a.m.: Pop out of bed</b></p><p>My alarm is at 9:30 a.m. every day. My family says we have the Lewison curse, which means you just never sleep. I'm also the type of person where my alarm goes off and I'm out of bed 30 seconds later, brushing my teeth.</p><p><b>9:45 a.m.: Head to the gym</b></p><p>I grab a protein bar and walk to the <b>USC Lyon Recreation Center</b>, which is where I work out. Im about to move, but for the last four years  my entire time being out in L.A.  I've lived and gone to school at USC. I graduated a year ago, but I'm still sort of living the college life. All my friends are still here and a lot of them are from out of state, so I was like, you know what? Ill spend one more year with my friends. </p><p><b>12 p.m.: Snack time</b></p><p>Then I'll come home, shower and I'll make the best protein shake of all time. I use this protein powder that's chocolate-flavored, the brand is Dymatize. I get two scoops of peanut butter in there and then some oat milk. I'm telling you, it tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Then, in a perfect world, I'm gonna make some Oreo cookie brownie bars to enjoy after dinner. I'm a big baker. I have a massive sweet tooth.</p><p><b>1 p.m.: Get lunch at the </b><a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/" target="_blank"><b>Original Farmers Market</b></a></p><p>I'm going to the <b>Ffarmers mMarket </b>at <b>Tthe</b> <b>Grove</b>. When I was a kid, I would come to L.A. for pilot season and I would eat at the farmers market with my mom and then drive to an audition.</p><p>Lunch is gonna be with my roommates, who are my best friends. I might have a corned beef sandwich at one of the deli spots. I might do the kebab stand. I might do the fried chicken place. I like to eat, so it could be that I go get a pickle from the <a href="https://farmersmarketla.com/merchants/kaylin-and-kaylin-pickles" target="_blank">little pickle guy stand</a>, or at least a sample. I'd probably get a fresh squeezed lemonade. I would like to say I can control myself, but I probably can't.</p><p><b>2 p.m.: Pick out a new book</b></p><p>Then I'm probably walking around <b>Barnes &amp; Noble</b>. I was never a reader growing up but after college, I was like, I want to read. I really like realistic fiction or sci-fi. Growing up, "Ender's Game" was like the only thing I ever read besides Percy Jackson and like "The Hunger Games" and "Divergent"  whatever was popular. But recently, I read all of Sally Rooney's books. And I really liked those  I'm a huge fan of Normal People. Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal, their performances [in "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six"] are mind-boggling to me and that's one of my favorite limited series. So right now, I'm reading "Daisy Jones &amp; the Six." I guess if it gets adapted into a TV show, I'm like, oh, I should do it.</p><p><b>2:30 p.m.: Wander around a museum&nbsp;</b></p><p>It might be the<b> Broad</b>. It might be the<b> Academy Museum of Motion Pictures</b>. I've been wanting to go to the <b>Petersen Automotive Museum</b>, so I'm probably gonna go there with my friends. I have a dream of owning a raven black Thunderbird, like a 1957 with chrome, red interior, and it's a convertible.</p><p>It's a very silly vision, but in my mind, when I've made it, I've got that car, I'm in a black suit with a black dress shirt with Ray-Ban sunglasses. The top is down and I'm driving down PCH to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqR1cjuPXUg&amp;ab_channel=ColterWall-Topic">The Devil Wears a Suit and Tie</a>. So I think that the Petersen Automotive Museum might be the closest I ever get to sitting in that car and driving on PCH while that song plays, but we'll see, you never know.</p><p><b>4:30 p.m.: Get an afternoon cone</b></p><p>My family has a tradition: we used to do 3 o'clock ice cream on vacations. I'm going to <b>McConnell's Fine Ice Creams</b> and as dark chocolate as it can get, that's what I want. My family is in Dallas, but I'll send them a picture in our family group chat.</p><p><b>5 p.m.: Head home to play Rocket League</b></p><p>My little group of seven will probably have a couple of drinks and we like to play <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League</a>. That's a big one in my house, we do some tournaments. My Rocket League partner, Dan, is one of my best friends. We've definitely figured out how to get some chemistry going on the Rocket League field.</p><p><b>7:15 p.m.: Eat as much meat as humanly possible </b></p><p>We're going to K-Town. I love Korean barbecue, I'm probably eating my face off. We're gonna have some beer, we're gonna have all the meat, maybe some of the fixings, but definitely a lot of meat. I'll probably be the grill master.</p><p>The first [Korean barbecue joint] that I was ever exposed to was <b>Gyu-Kaku</b>, which is really solid. But there are a couple of gems in K-town. Every time I go, I try a new place. <b>Quarters Korean BBQ</b> is really, really good. I actually went there with the "Never Have I Ever" crew and cast.</p><p><b>9:30 p.m.: Choose an adventure </b></p><p>There are a few options now. We could do karaoke in K-town. Im a Texas boy. I am not a singer, but I think I can sing a country song and be all right. I think it's gonna be "Wagon Wheel" by Darius Rucker. One time, my roommate and I went up for karaoke and sang "My Way" by Frank Sinatra, and I do think that brought the house down.</p><p>Or perhaps an escape room. Or we're going back to my house, and it's a game night. My house is a Settlers of Catan house. We actually have a chalkboard wall and we have a winner's standings column that gets updated after every game.</p><p><b>12 a.m.: Grab a midnight snack at Canters</b></p><p>At this point, it might be time to go to <b>Canter's Deli</b>. I'm a huge Jewish deli person and Canter's is open 24 hours, so I'm gonna milk the hell out of that. </p>So I'm probably getting the corned beef sandwich. And then I think bedtime is around 1:30 a.m.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Apart from the occasional plea to an audience, "Please do not reveal the shocking conclusion</p> ,<p>" as in punchline movies like "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-ca-sleuth9sep09-story.html">Sleuth</a>" or "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-08-06/haley-joel-osment-sixth-sense-anniversary">The Sixth Sense</a>," spoilers were until relatively recently not a thing. These days</p> ,<p> some viewers think nothing should ever be revealed about a show or film they haven't gotten around to watching yet  which is to say, ever  though it is easy enough not to read reviews. (Harder to avoid is social media, where </p>lay<p> viewers spoil more plot points than any professional critic has the time to.)</p><p>Networks and streamers and their marketing departments have now come preemptively to ask critics not to reveal certain details of a series in order to "preserve the audience viewing experience," though just which details </p> areis<p> usually left to the writer's discretion. Most reviewers, who are also viewers, understand and are happy to oblige. Specific requests are by and large easy to accommodate  sometimes they are so minor, you wonder what the fuss is.</p><p>Which brings us to "<a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/the-crowded-room/umc.cmc.495pmjg441gg3j70j3x2yufx9" target="_blank">The Crowded Room</a>," premiering Friday on Apple TV+. The official requests, though few, are so broadly stated and so central to the series as to make any meaningful review of the program impossible  indeed, one requested Thing to Avoid is common to nearly every mystery or thriller, if not, indeed, their very definition. Apart from commenting on the production values, performances, pacing, general quality of dialogue and describing the action in the early episodes, there will not be much to say  certainly nothing about the </p>series' <p>actual subject </p> of the series<p>, how it's treated, and whether "The Crowded Room" succeeds in its aims, except in the vaguest terms, and even some vague terms qualify as forbidden.</p><p>(Of course</p> ,<p> there is no law saying that a writer can't refuse to honor these requests, but for the most part</p> ,<p> we go along to get along.)</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/12/75/938ff26f46c4aa7fc15944465d98/the-crowded-room-photo-0101071.jpg"></figure><p>Here is the official description of the series.</p>Starring and executive produced by  Tom Holland, The Crowded Room is a gripping, 10-episode limited series that stars Holland as  Danny Sullivan, a man who is arrested following his involvement in a shooting in New York City in 1979. A captivating thriller told through a series of interviews with curious interrogator  Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried), Dannys life story unfolds, revealing elements of the mysterious past that shaped him, and the twists and turns that will lead him to a life-altering revelation.<p>It's probably safe to mention that the series was created by </p> Akiva Goldsman<p>, and inspired by a "non-fiction novel," with which it has little in common past its greater subject, which I am not supposed to tell you. (That each episode ends with a title card reading "If you or someone you know, needs support, go to apple.com/heretohelp" might say something, if nothing in particular.) As is often the case, the property has been bouncing around Hollywood for a while, changing its shape and name until finding its current</p>, 10-episode, limited-series cutting this since we say it above<p> form. That Goldsman, who wrote the screenplay for "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-feb-13-et-gold13-story.html">A Beautiful Mind</a>," is best known for his work in sci-fi, horror and genre pictures is not irrelevant to the way he has externalized certain psychological elements. (I was also reminded in this respect of the Disney</p> -<p>Pixar film "<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-inside-out-pixar-movie-reviews-critics-20150617-story.html">Inside Out</a>.") I wouldn't call it technically, or medically, accurate, but it does make a kind of pictorial sense.</p><p>Anyway, as our story opens, we see Danny, a nervous, bedraggled young man, clutching a paper bag, riding a subway in the company of a woman we will come to know as </p> Ariana (Sasha Lane)<p>. Up from the underground, he passes by Radio City Music Hall, with Frank Sinatra advertised on the marquee  the period work makes an immediate impression, all those extras in vintage clothing, all the old cars on the street  and proceeds to Rockefeller Center, where a gun comes out and goes off multiple times.</p><p>In the very next scene, police arrest Danny </p> atfrom <p>his home (Ariana has "disappeared"), and then we are at the station house, one cop noting that Danny was "just a little good luck shy of a murder charge." (No one was killed.) </p> Det. Matty Dunne (Thomas Sadoski)<p> wonders whether </p> Dannyhe<p> might be a serial killer, and subsequent flashbacks seem to indicate we'll be witnessing TV's </p>nth<p>-hundred "making of a psycho" story. The series quickly brings in </p> Seyfried<p>'s character, Rya, whom Dunne addresses as "professor" and who is invited to ask Danny questions. Their scenes together are quietly compelling; indeed, this story could be told effectively as a duologue  though not over </p> 10 <p>hours, a length that seems arbitrary as regards the drama, but </p> that<p> must have been deemed economically advantageous.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/f8/89/bc7637144390bba788cab6b6a256/the-crowded-room-photo-0101021.jpg"></figure><p>"I wasn't a very popular kid at school," Danny tells Rya; and Holland, </p> though <p>27 and British, does impressively inhabit a luckless American high school student. (He'll age a few years over the course of the show.) Saddled with an immediately unlikable stepfather (</p> Will Chase<p>) and an intimidated mother (</p> Emmy Rossum<p>), Danny relies for support first on two goofball friends, </p> Mike (Sam Vartholomeos)<p>, who is sporty, and </p> Jonny (Levon Hawke)<p>, who does card tricks and knows where to buy pot. Later, moving into what he calls "the ghost house," he will come under the protective wing of bullish landlord </p> Yitzhak (Lior Ra   z  s) <p>and wild child Ariana. (That the police can locate neither after the Rockefeller Center incident is what prompts Det. Dunne to imagine a serial killer.) Even later, in London, of all unlikely places, we'll meet another sort of guardian,</p>  Jack (Jason Isaacs),<p> who has something to do with Danny's biological father.</p><p>Filling out the opening episodes are a girl Danny likes, Annabelle</p> Isabel on IMDB but it's Annabelle; it was doubtless once Isabel, but changed<p> (Emma Laird), a bully who doesn't like him and some frightening local drug dealers with whom the kids get mixed up. Things turn a little violent sometimes. There's also talk of Danny's absent twin, Adam, whose fate remains mysterious up until the moment the series declares something you have already guessed.</p><p>There are time jumps in these early scenes, some obvious, some not, and gaps you will not notice until they are filled in later on, as early scenes are revisited. This is cleverly done, though you would have to watch the series twice to get a full sense of it, because "The Crowded Room" is very long, and you may have forgotten much by the time you reach the end.</p><p>Things have been arranged to keep Danny sympathetic throughout, if a little confounding at times, more victim than victimizer, and the series advances toward a conclusion that will allow Rya to muse lengthily upon overcoming hurt. ("If a relationship can break you, then sometimes a relationship can also heal you," she begins.) The story is sad, but ultimately not a tragedy, which would have felt very much like a waste of time.</p><p>The performances are good; the production values are high</p> ;,<p> the dialogue is well-written. The soundtrack is filled with great songs from the period  the late 70s produced a lot of fantastic music. Some things make enough sense for one of Goldsmans <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/blogs/the-big-picture/story/2009-05-15/angels-demons-at-least-tom-hanks-has-better-hair">Dan Brown adaptations</a>, but not really enough for a series that wants to engage in real</p> -<p>world problems and pathologies. The length of the series, which is padded with extraneous material  including a home life for Rya and a backstory for Dannys mother and stepfather  and scenes that run longer than necessary</p> , <p> dilutes its effects, saps the drama of energy. ("The Sixth Sense" took only 108 minutes to get to its big reveal.)</p><p>In the end, the filmmakers  or the promotion</p> al<p> team at Apple  may be overly concerned about maintaining the element of surprise. The series' actual subject matter becomes obvious relatively early anyway, and, really, one could know it from the start without the viewing experience being significantly harmed. There are levels in the misdirection, and not all its secrets are given up at once.</p> The Crowded Room                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

And you desperately want it to be solved, given the particular monstrousness of the crime. </p><p>In a scenic valley near Grenoble, a 21-year-old woman named Clara (Lula Cotton Frapier) is walking home late one night when a faceless assailant emerges from the shadows, douses her with gasoline and sets her ablaze. Its a horrifying assault, deeply personal in its brutality  the killer whispers her name beforehand  and it haunts you, much as it haunts the investigators who spend weeks, months and ultimately years trying to earn Clara a measure of justice.</p>The d  D<p>irector Dominik Moll (With a Friend Like Harry  , Only the Animals), who wrote the script with </p>his<p> regular collaborator Gilles Marchand, introduces us to those investigators at the outset. Mere hours before the attack, a group of police detectives </p>are is<p> celebrating a colleagues retirement and welcoming his much younger replacement, Yohan (Bastien Bouillon). </p><p>The scene plays at first like routine exposition; Yohan, the new head of the homicide unit, will be our eyes and ears on the investigation into Claras </p>murder killing<p>. But from the way Moll cuts through the crowd, I think he also means for us to scan the faces of Yohans colleagues, to register their boisterous, clubby energy and to notice, crucially but hardly surprisingly, that nearly all of them are men.</p><p>The same is true of the various creeps Yohan and his team will interrogate over the course of their long, frustrating investigation into Claras death. Nearly all of them were (or claim to have been) romantically involved at one point or another with the deceased, an attractive young woman with a seemingly unquenchable passion for life and love. Thats putting it more politely than some of the men do, whether its the former co-worker (Baptiste Perais) who describes Clara as a clingy side-piece or the smug domestic abuser (Pierre Lottin) who claims she liked it rough.</p><p>Clara, of course, is unable to defend herself against these characterizations, not all of which come from her potential assailants. She went for freaks, one cop says, an instance of slut shaming and victim blaming that inspires a sharp rebuke from Yohan. </p><p>Played with keen intelligence and compelling restraint by Bouillon, Yohan represents a younger, more enlightened breed of cop: quick to empathize, slow to judge, reluctant to use force unless necessary. His older, more cynical partner, Marceau (Bouli Lanners, excellent), has fewer inhibitions and more paternalistic instincts: Disgusted by the various men hes interrogating and troubled by personal problems at home, he lashes out with a nothing-to-lose abandon thats neither defensible nor dismissible.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c2/bd/902355e540c3929fbad1b961e4b4/4-lndu12-credit-hautetcourt.jpeg"></figure><p>The Night of the 12th </p> (La nuit du 12)<p> which swept Frances Csar Awards </p>earlier<p> this year (it won six prizes, including for best picture and director), is thus both an engrossing detective story and something of an expansive sociological X-ray.</p><p> Its persuasive, low-key realism has its roots in Pauline Gunas 2020 book, 18.3  Une Anne  la PJ, about a year she spent embedded with criminal investigators in Versailles. But that realism also arises from Molls patience as a filmmaker, his desire to capture some of the drudgery and disillusionment of everyday police work</p>,<p> and to show the emotional and psychological toll it takes on its most dedicated practitioners.</p><p>Working with cinematographer Patrick Ghiringhelli and editor Laurent Rouan, Moll tells the story with atmospheric sweep (the mountainside scenery provides a beautiful, desolate chill) and an unhurried flow. </p><p>He has a way of infusing even standard procedural tropes  the scouring of the crime scene, the breaking of the news to devastated parents and friends, the endless stakeouts, dead ends and false leads  with an unexpected gravity and emotional power. </p><p>Even the seasoned crime-fiction aficionado will be reminded here of not just the trauma of murder but also its invasive, disruptive power, the way it brings even tangential secrets into the open and turns the police into professional airers of dirty laundry.</p><p>What emerges from this particular case is an expansive study in collective misogyny  the kind of free-floating contempt for women that holds sway over Claras small hometown as well as this institution of ostensible law and order. </p><p>The storys timing is instructive: Most of it takes place in 2016, shortly before the rise of a #MeToo movement that, in Europe especially, will encounter both resistance and support. But by the time the story concludes three years later, some changes have clearly come to pass: Notably, its a female judge (Anouk Grinberg) who urges Yohan to reopen the case in 2019, something he undertakes with crucial assistance from a new colleague, Nadia (Mouna Soualem), one of the few </p>women female<p> detectives in the homicide unit.</p><p>Men kill, and the police are men, Nadia says. Odd, isnt it? It isnt the only time The Night of the 12th spells out its themes and implications with blunt force, something it also does with its recurring shots of Yohan doing laps on his bicycle around a velodrome. </p><p>If these moments veer toward the obvious, the movie admirably resists a conventional resolution. The </p>movies films<p> refusal to tie up loose ends has already inspired comparisons to Bong Joon Hos <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-30/critics-choice-memories-of-murder-bong-joon-ho">Memories of Murder</a> and David Finchers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-jul-22-ca-second22-story.html">Zodiac,</a> two of modern cinemas great cold-case classics. Molls movie doesnt leave behind the same deep, implacable chill of those earlier works, but its lingering rage and sorrow are no less easy to wave aside.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Philippe</a> and his style of movie essay. Over a handful of documentaries, Philippe has turned what we dig into excuses to dig: Alien, The Exorcist and the shower scene in Psycho all have come in for feature length dissections of speculative fun and forensic reverence. His Lynch/Oz is a similarly celebratory journey of detail and overview, thick with footage, dotted with bits from Lynch interviews and appearances, and narrated by a cadre of cinephiles: six filmmakers and one critic.</p><p>But in moving his purview from the confines of a single movie or sequence to a surrealism-friendly directors entire oeuvre  plus, of course, what the Judy Garland-led 1939 classic has to do with it  Philippe winds up with a curatorial hodgepodge; the lovingly cited connections about shifting realities, artifice, searching and all those plush Lynchian curtains never coalesce into anything unifying, and sometimes get repeated by different narrators. Meanwhile, the musings and references that seemingly have nothing to do with either Lynch or Oz (Back to the Future? Beverly Hills Cop?) stick out like pickled herring in your cherry pie.</p> 33490id-015.jpg<p>Individually, the six hosted sections have their moments, the way time spent with a movie obsessive friend can feel like getting pleasurably zapped into a distinct consciousness. In a chapter titled Wind, critic Amy Nicholson (full disclosure: She</p> actually<p> is a friend) hooks us invitingly into the experiential thrill of our twin subjects can-you-handle-them worlds, while <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2022-05-23/john-waters-does-los-angeles">John Waters</a> (Kindred)  </p> in  it<p> what sound</p>s<p> like off-the-cuff answers to unheard questions, rather than a scripted monologue  speaks to the affinity he has for a fellow provocateur and Oz stan.</p><p>Elsewhere, in hit-and-miss discourses from filmmakers <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2021-02-20/glitch-in-the-matrix-simulation-theory-ascher">Rodney Ascher</a> (Membranes), the team of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead (Judy), and David Lowery (Dig), Philippe seems to be making up for their wandering across the whole of cinema by ramping up the clip shout-outs to Chuck Workman-like levels. Someone watching Lynch/Oz isnt likely to need reminding that the history of movies is a history of other movies, or that lots of directors have thematic and visual fetishes. But this one does it anyway, and often, when what were here for is the dive into everything Oz-adjacent about Blue Velvet, or Inland Empire, or Eraserhead, or Twin Peaks: The Return or whichever Lynchian headscratcher you choose. Why are the allusions explicit in Wild at Heart, for instance, but more enigmatic in Lost Highway?</p><p>Which is why the segment that most meets the potential Lynch/Oz sets up is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-the-invitation-karyn-kusama-20160414-story.html">Karyn Kusamas</a> (Multitudes), because it bores in without getting sidetracked by generalities. Sparked by amusing anecdotes about Lynchs love of syrupy pancakes and aversion to explanation, it engages deeply and personally with the refractive mysteries and epiphanies of one Lynch masterwork  his 2001 neo-noir opus Mulholland Drive  as it reflects the gestural creativity of someone for whom The Wizard of Oz is formative and omnipresent.</p><p>Kusama thoughtfully and intelligently unwraps a pair of great films for us, while acknowledging what is inherently difficult about ascribing anything like truth to a person, a character or a work of art. As she says about Lynch, a multiplicity of possibilities is the rule, not the exception. Lynch/Oz overall, meanwhile, gets lost in its variations and fusions, a lot of eagerly analytical heel-clicking never quite transporting us home.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
