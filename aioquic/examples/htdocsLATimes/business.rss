Loeb said in a statement. "We will continue to explore all avenues to provide necessary assistance to our members as they weather the storm during the writers strike.</p><p>Film and TV productions across the country have<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-24/writers-strike-productions-billions-tv-wga-strategy-networks"> been shut down</a> as a result of the strike leaving many other workers in the industry struggling to make ends meet.</p><p>The writers' walkout has been supported by other industry unions including IATSE, whose members have </p>helped  halt productions by not refused to cross <p>picket lines. </p><p>In Los Angeles County</p> alone<p>, scripted TV production has </p> haltedshut down <p>completely, with no scripted shows set to film this week, according to FilmLA, which organizes film permits for the region. </p><p>Alongside union members, non-union film and TV workers have also been hit hard by the work stoppages. </p><p>The advocacy group <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-10-16/assistant-pay-inequality-payuphollywood">#PayUpHollywood</a></p>,&nbsp;<p>in collaboration with the&nbsp;Entertainment Community Fund&nbsp;and&nbsp;WIF (Women in Film), relaunched The Hollywood Support Staff Relief Fund this week to aid support staff on film and TV shows. </p>The aim is to make the fund a permanent resource in case of future industry-wide shutdowns, the group said in a statement Wednesday. <p>The fund, led by Writers Guild of America West board member </p> Liz Hsiao Lan Alper<p> and support staffer Alex Rubin, will offer one-time grants to assistants and support staff with less than three years of industry expertise who have lost work due to strikes. </p><p>WIF donated $10,000 to the fund, which was originally created in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 health crisis. Then, it was able to provide more than $500,000 in aid to assistants and other support staff </p>such as assistants who are not part of unions<p>. </p><p>These workers are the most heavily impacted when unexpected events shut down the entertainment industry, Alper said. "Making the Hollywood Support Staff Relief Fund a permanent emergency fund gives these workers a much-needed resource that wasnt available before."</p><p>The WGA has its own fund to assist writers during the strike.

More than 9 million people live within 50 miles of the plant.</p><p>Some 73 canisters loaded with spent fuel assemblies have been lowered into vertical cavities at a storage site on the north end of the plant, behind a seawall a little more than 100 feet from the Pacific Ocean. An additional 50 canisters of waste rest horizontally nearby.</p><p>To identify potential sites, the Energy Department will fund 13 groups from different areas of the country to engage, set up workshops and elicit feedback from communities that may be interested in building interim facilities. The 13 groups  partnerships with universities, industry and nonprofits  will receive about $2 million each.</p> California's blistering heat sparked power shortages last summer. Here's this year's forecast<p>"Some communities don't know what it means," Granholm said. "They might be in, they might be out, but the bottom line is we have to form trust and be able to educate them and work with them on what their concerns are." </p><p>Eventually, the Energy Department and the Biden administration want to find one to three communities for what the nuclear industry calls "consolidated interim storage" facilities. </p><p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Consent-Based%20Siting%20Process%20Report-0424%203.pdf" target="_blank">According to a report released in April</a>, the Energy Department estimates the entire process of identifying, screening, selecting and then building an interim storage site will take 10 to 15 years.</p><p>"In this phase, we're beginning the conversation," said <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/person/dr-kathryn-huff" target="_blank">Kathryn Huff, assistant secretary for the Office of Nuclear Energy at the Energy Department</a>.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/77/f4/af7df2264dbfb1bd8ec6df77f750/1306742-sd-fi-songs-wastetimeline-ec-002.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Mike_Levin">Rep. Mike Levin</a> (D-San Juan Capistrano) accompanied Granholm on a tour of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, known as SONGS</p> for short<p>. </p><p>"We finally have a plan when it comes to spent nuclear fuel across the United States," Levin said. "Now we've got to execute on that plan." <b> </b></p><p>Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the federal government has a legal responsibility to dispose of <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/energy-department-seeks-towns-willing-to-temporarily-store-nuclear-waste/">the roughly 89,000 metric tons</a> of waste that has accumulated at nuclear power plants <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/images/reading-rm/doc-collections/maps/isfsi-facility-types.png">in 35 states</a>.</p><p>A giant underground permanent repository was near completion at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada, but in 2010, the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/10/yucca.mountain.shutdown/index.html">Obama administration halted the project</a>, after years of opposition from Silver State lawmakers, including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. </p><p>With Yucca off the table, focus has shifted to finding interim facilities. </p> The revolving door at public utilities commissions? It's alive and well<p>To avoid a repeat of Yucca, the Energy Department is now taking a consent-based approach to find communities that may be open to building a storage facility because of the prospect of more local jobs and economic growth.</p><p>"Anything that doesn't include consent can easily be delayed or stopped completely," Huff said. "And we really intend to arrive at a robust and durable solution here  something that will outlast this administration and move out into a longer-term commitment." </p><p>But finding those communities may be difficult. </p><p>A proposed interim facility in southeastern New Mexico has been opposed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, and the New Mexico Legislature earlier this year passed a bill <a href="https://www.ans.org/news/article-4833/new-mexico-sets-up-roadblock-to-holtec-storage-facility/" target="_blank">prohibiting the storage and disposal</a> of radioactive waste without the states consent. The issue may end up in court. </p><p>A similar story is playing out in Texas. A potential storage project in the town of Andrews </p>touts it can is touted as being able to <p>hold as much as 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel for up to 40 years, but Gov. Greg Abbott <a href="https://twitter.com/gregabbott_tx/status/1324939516248010752">tweeted</a>, Texas will not become Americas nuclear dumping ground. (For perspective, San Onofre stores roughly 1,610 metric tons of spent fuel on its premises.)</p> PG&amp;E can keep operating Diablo Canyon  at least for now, feds say<p>One of the concerns for communities considering building an interim storage facility: Will they get stuck with the waste for decades, should the federal government not find a permanent site?</p><p>"That's why we want to have a discussion," Granholm said, "to let [the communities] know what the law says, what the specifics are, get them comfortable. If they don't want to do it, we don't want to force it on anybody. We're confident in the discussions that we've had at this point that there are communities that are willing to engage those discussions to have an interim site."</p><p>There have been signs of progress in other countries. </p><p>Finland, for instance, is nearing completion of its <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2023-06-finland-nuclear-catacombs-ready-house.html" target="_blank">Onkalo spent nuclear fuel disposal facility</a> that will permanently hold 6,500 metric tons of waste produced during the lifetimes of the country's five nuclear reactors. Canada is scheduled to announce a location for a national repository in <a href="https://thebulletin.org/premium/2023-01/final-countdown-to-site-selection-for-canadas-nuclear-waste-geologic-repository/" target="_blank">the fall of 2024</a>. </p><p>"We have not done this right in the United States in the past," Granholm said. "We have said, 'OK, Yucca Mountain, you're it,' without getting the consent of the community that is most affected. This is what we've learned from Finland and Canada. They had a process that was very respectful of communities ... and that's what we're going to do, too." </p><p>As for the search for a permanent site to replace Yucca Mountain, Granholm said that will begin once authorization is approved. "The first step is [interim facilities] and then we'll go on to that later."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/37/43/5b2fafaf43cfb9690fd9ed7dfe21/1306742-sd-fi-songs-wastetimeline-ec-001.jpg"></figure><p>On Capitol Hill, Levin has helped secure <a href="https://levin.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-mike-levin-applauds-department-of-energys-new-plan-for-storage-of-spent-nuclear-fuel" target="_blank">$93 million in funding in the last three fiscal years</a> to move consent-based siting along. </p><p>Levin and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Darrell_Issa">Rep.

"We can do it here and it will work here, too. It won't happen overnight but we've finally got the momentum that we've lacked for the last 10 or 15 years." <b> </b></p><p>San Onofre has not produced electricity since 2012 after a leak in a steam generator tube led to its closing.

The agency has a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/faa-acting-administrator-biden-buttigieg-079bbc6c1abb13b404946c75a06ec311">new acting administrator</a> with no aviation experience. It has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader for more than a year, since the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-stephen-dickson-federal-aviation-administration-8785ab0a556dbb20eec2d04638b2dd53">last one resigned</a> halfway through his term.</p><p>One provision of the House bill would let airlines advertise the base airfare  excluding taxes and fees  as long as they include a link to the all-in price or disclose it some other way. That would weaken an Obama administration rule that airlines have long fought to kill, and consumer advocates are unhappy about the House move.</p><p>These protections were hard fought and took years to enact, said William McGee, an aviation expert at the American Economic Liberties Project. Any consumer can tell you that online airline bookings are confusing enough. The last thing we need is to roll back an existing protection that provides effective transparency.</p> 'It was horrible': Stranded Southwest passengers still waiting to recoup costs from airline meltdown<p>The House committee leaders also propose to let people become airline pilots with less time in the cockpit. The bill would not change the requirement for 1,500 hours of training, but it would allow 250 hours  up from the current 100 hours  to occur in simulators rather than flying a plane.</p><p>Airlines, particularly the smaller ones that operate regional flights, have long fought against the 1,500-hour rule, which already has exemptions that let military pilots and graduates of some aviation schools qualify with fewer hours. The rule was put in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ae9faf4921d34189acfcc895ea48f677">after a 2009 crash that killed 50 people.</a></p><p>Garth Thompson, head of the Air Line Pilots Assn. </p>Association<p> unit at United Airlines, said it is a horrible idea" to weaken the rule.</p><p>That rule, like so many federal aviation regulations, is written in blood, literally, Thompson said. That regulation came about because of the <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/accidentreports/reports/aar1001.pdf" target="_blank">Colgan Air crash</a> and other crashes that involved experience issues.</p><p>Asked about changes in airfare advertising and pilot training, Larsen said, It's something we can live with. The change in pilot training rules, he said, is a priority of the Transportation Committee's Republican chairman, Sam Graves of Missouri, and both sides had to compromise during drafting of the bill.</p><p>Elsewhere in the bill, Larsen said, Democrats were able to include provisions they wanted, such as those covering wheelchair accessibility.</p><p>The bill also includes provisions aimed at improving airport infrastructure and the supply of sustainable aviation fuel. It would require airline planes to be outfitted with better cockpit voice recorders and, for the first time, cockpit video recorders to improve accident investigations. Pilots have opposed the video recorders.</p><p>Some other contentious topics were left out, including raising the mandatory retirement age of 65 for pilots and easing restrictions on flights from Reagan Washington National Airport in northern Virginia. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That doesnt factor in her <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-14/with-the-status-of-student-loans-is-in-the-air-scammers">student loans</a>, which have been on hold since the start of the pandemic and are estimated to cost $300 a month. The pause in repayment has been a lifeline keeping the 25-year-old afloat.</p><p>I dont even know where I would begin to budget that money, said Chanthanouvong, who works in marketing in San Francisco.</p><p>Now, after more than three years, the lifeline is being pulled away.</p><p>More than 40 million Americans will be on the hook for federal student loan payments starting in late August under the terms of a debt ceiling deal approved by Congress last week. The Biden administration has been targeting that timeline for months, but the deal ends any hope of a further extension of the pause, which has been prolonged while the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-02/editorial-court-should-not-yank-away-lifeline-for-people-drowning-in-student-debt">Supreme Court decides the presidents debt cancellation</a>.</p><p>A Republican measure overturning Bidens student loan cancellation plan passed the Senate last week, but the president vetoed the bill Wednesday.</p> Anxious about your student loan debt? Beware of offers that are too good to be true<p>Without cancellation, the Education Department predicts borrowers will fall behind on their loans at historic rates. Among the most vulnerable are those who finished college during the pandemic. Millions have never had to make a loan payment, and their bills will soon come amid soaring inflation and forecasts of economic recession.</p><p>Advocates fear it will add a financial burden that younger borrowers cant afford.</p><p>I worry that were going to see levels of default of new graduates that weve never seen before, said Natalia Abrams, president of the nonprofit Student Debt Crisis Center. </p><p>Chanthanouvong earned a bachelors in sociology from the University of California, Merced, in 2019. She couldnt find a job for a year, leaving her to rely on odd jobs for income. She found a full-time job last year, but at $70,000, her salary barely covers the cost of living in the Bay Area.</p><p>Im not going out. I dont buy Starbucks every day. Im cooking at home, she said. And sometimes, I dont even have $100 after everything.</p><p>Under President </p>Joe <p>Bidens cancellation plan, Chanthanouvong would be eligible to get $20,000 of her debt erased, leaving her owing $5,000. But she isnt banking on the relief. Instead, she invited her partner to move in and split rent. The financial pinch has them postponing or rethinking major life milestones. </p> Editorial: Supreme Court should not yank away the lifeline for people drowning in student debt<p>My partner and I agreed, maybe we dont want kids, she said. Not because we dont want them, but because it would be financially irresponsible for us to bring a human being into this world.</p><p>Out of the more than 44 million federal student loan borrowers, about 7 million are below the age of 25, according to data from the Education Department. Their average loan balance is less than $14,000, lower than any other age group.</p><p>Yet borrowers with lower balances are the most likely to default. It's fueled by millions who drop out before graduating, along with others who graduate but struggle to find good jobs. Among those who defaulted in 2021, the median loan balance was $15,300, and the vast majority had balances under $40,000, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p>Resuming student loan payments will cost U.S. consumers $18 billion a month, the investment firm Jefferies has estimated. The hit to household budgets is ill-timed for the overall economy, Jefferies says, because the United States is widely believed to be on the brink of a recession.</p><p>Despite the student loan moratorium, Americans mostly didn't bank their savings, according to Jefferies economist Thomas Simons. So theyll likely have to cut back on other things  travel, restaurants  to fit resumed loan payments into their budgets. Belt-tightening could hurt an economy that relies heavily on consumer spending.</p> Letters to the Editor: Is canceling student debt fair? <p>Noshin Hoque graduated from Stony Brook University early in the pandemic with about $20,000 in federal student loans. Instead of testing the 2020 job market, she enrolled </p>at in<p> a masters program in social work at Columbia University, borrowing $34,000 more.</p><p>With the payments paused, she felt a new level of financial security. She cut costs by living with her parents in New York City and her job at a nonprofit paid enough to save money and help her parents.</p><p>She recalls splurging on a $110 polo shirt as a Fathers Day gift for her dad.</p><p>Being able to do stuff for my parents and having them experience that luxury with me has just been such a plus, said Hoque, who works for Young Invincibles, a nonprofit that supports student debt cancellation.</p><p>It gave her the comfort to enter a new stage of life. She got married to a recent medical school graduate, and they're expecting their first child in November. At the same time, theyre bracing for the crush of loan payments, which will cost at least $400 a month combined. They hope to pay more to avoid interest, which is prohibited for them as practicing Muslims.</p><p>To prepare, they stopped eating at restaurants. They canceled a vacation to Italy. Money they wanted to put toward their childs education fund will go to their loans instead.</p><p>Were back to square one of planning our finances, she said. I feel that so deeply.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>Even the logistics of making payments will be a hurdle for newer borrowers, said Rachel Rotunda, director of government relations at National </p>Association  Assn.<p> of Student Financial Aid Administrators. They'll need to find out who their loan servicers are, choose a repayment plan and learn to navigate the payment system.</p><p>The volume of borrowers going back on the system at the same time  this has never happened before, Rotunda said. It's fair to say it's going to be bumpy.</p><p>The Education Department has promised to make the restart of payments as smooth as possible. In a statement, the agency said it will continue to push for Biden's debt cancellation as a way to reduce borrowers' debt load and ease the transition.</p><p>For Beka Favela, 30, the payment pause provided independence. She earned a master's in counseling last year, and her job as a therapist allowed her to move out of her parents' house.</p><p>Without making payments on her $80,000 in student loans, she started saving. She bought furniture. She chipped away at credit card debt. But once the pause ends, she expects to pay about $500 a month. It will consume most of her disposable income, leaving little for surprise costs. If finances get tighter, she wonders </p>if  whether<p> she'll have to move back home.</p><p>I dont want to feel like I'm regressing in order to make ends meet, said Favela, of Westmont, Ill. I just want to keep moving forward. I'm worried, is that going to be possible?</p>AP Economics Wwriter Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

After his rent surged past $1,000 a month in early 2021 he feared he would have to move out  until he got a $7,300 lifeline from the federal <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2023-06-09/state-reaches-settlement-over-pandemic-rent-relief-what-tenants-and-landords-need-to-know">Emergency Rental Assistance Program</a>.</p><p>That kept him in his apartment and even helped him build a small nest egg. Now graduated and working full time, hes a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-03-29/buying-a-socal-house-the-great-home-hunt-guide">first-time home buyer</a>.</p><p>Bautista is one of millions of renters who benefited from temporary programs put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on evictions, income support  and the rental assistance program. One of the most ambitious investments in emergency housing in the nations history, it has disbursed $46 billion in aid to state and local governments since early 2021 and kept millions of people in their homes, according to an analysis of government data by Bloomberg News.</p><p>With rents still climbing and the economy at risk of a recession, housing advocates are urging the Biden administration to keep helping tenants. That will be hard under legislation signed into law last weekend that suspended the nations borrowing limit as it clawed back unused pandemic aid and imposed caps on future increases in the federal budget.</p><p>We are facing an affordable housing crisis in this country, yet Republican lawmakers are insisting on slashing funding for and jeopardizing the future of critical housing affordability programs that support working families, Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said in a statement.</p> State reaches settlement over pandemic rent relief: What tenants and landlords need to know <p>Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau show that, on average, 48.46 million people reported being caught up on their rent during the first quarter of this year, 4.7 million more than before the Emergency Rental Assistance Program was put in place as the economy was reeling from shutdowns. Even though the estimated number of renters in the country increased during the period, the number of people behind on their rent fell.</p><p>These policies drove eviction filing rates to historic lows," </p>according to <p>a <a href="https://evictionlab.org/covid-era-policies-cut-eviction-filings-by-more-than-half/">report</a> from the Eviction Lab </p> stated<p>. Eviction filings were cut by more than half </p> inof<p> 31 cities they sampled, largely due to COVID-era policies, according to the lab, a housing research group at Princeton University.</p><p>Nevertheless, Republicans have shown little appetite for continuing pandemic-era programs, including for rent assistance, as they seek to reduce the federal budget deficit.</p><p>Progressives attempts to make crisis programs permanent, even after an emergency ends, is just another example of Democrats spending taxpayer money we dont have, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), a key negotiator on the debt limit bill, said in a statement. Now its time to end this program.</p><p>The Treasury Department let states, counties and cities use the emergency rent aid in one of three ways: on direct assistance to households, housing stability measures and administrative expenses. About $33 billion of the $46 billion was used for direct assistance to more than 7 million households, according to a Bloomberg evaluation of Treasury data.</p> L.A. County supervisors propose adopting permanent rental protections<p>States, on average, sent 70% of their used funds directly to tenants and landlords, and those that spent most of the money for direct assistance tended to help more tenants get up to date on their rent  suggesting the program was having the desired effect. California, for example, used more than 75% of the $5.6 billion allocated to it from the rental assistance program for direct aid to tenants and landlords. The result: an average of 986,000 more renters were caught up on rent than before the program was established. New York saw about 440,000 residents catch up, or almost 10% of the tenants in the state.</p><p>North Dakota spent less on rental payments and it is one of four states  Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia are the others  that saw the number of tenants behind on rent grow.</p><p>Direct assistance was limited to renters with an income below 80% of the areas median income and who were able to demonstrate that they were at risk of homelessness and </p>and<p> were suffering a financial hardship because of the pandemic.</p><p>Bautista, the former University of Texas student, met the eligibility </p> requirements<p>. He now works as a management assistant for a low-income housing coalition. On the side, he doles out affordable housing advice to college students and recent grads.</p><p>Im not supposed to be where I am today, he said. This program changed my life.</p> Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone<p>The Treasury Department and state governments were criticized&nbsp;for dispersing money too slowly at the programs onset. Some states even had their funding reallocated.</p><p>The Treasury said it tracked some information</p> ,<p> like the number of dollars distributed, the number of households served</p>,<p> and the demographics of its applicants. However, program administrators said they didn't have the bandwidth to measure or poll whether recipients were able to catch up on rent while it was dispersing funds.</p><p>We faced a race with time. Experts were projecting a tsunami of evictions if we did not get the emergency rental payments flowing before the eviction moratorium ended, Gene Sperling, a senior White House advisor and coordinator of the Biden administrations American Rescue Plan, said in a statement. The fact that we actually saw eviction rates go below historic averages was proof we did get payments out in time.</p><p>Data on evictions is hard to come by, said Peter Hepburn, associate director of the Eviction Lab. There are more than 3,000 independently operated county courts that handle evictions, many of which often keep documents sealed, undigitized or both.</p><p>The lab credits the pandemic measures for preventing at least 800,000 evictions in 31 U.S. metropolitan areas it studied.</p><p>The rental assistance program itself has been a godsend and a blessing for everyone who has been able to use those funds to remain housed, said Mark Fessler, deputy director of litigation and training at the nonprofit South Carolina Legal Services.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest move on interest rates. Column: Forget the metaverse. For $3,500, Apple offers a new way to be alone So far, the economy has been able to avoid a <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-08-04/how-to-recession-proof-your-life-amid-economic-uncertainty">recession</a></p>  even though the Fed has jacked rates up at a furious pace for more than a year in hopes of driving down inflation. The highest rates since 2007 have helped inflation come down some, but its still above everyones comfort level. That means the big question on Wall Street is whether inflation will recede quickly enough for the Fed to take it easier on interest rates before the economy falls into a recession. A stronger-than-expected report on hiring last week raised hopes that the economy can slide through its troubles without a recession, but many other areas have already begun to crack. Besides helping to cause&nbsp;three-high profile U.S. banking failures&nbsp;since March, high interest rates have also pushed the manufacturing industry to shrink for months. The banking industrys turmoil has also caused banks to make it tougher for customers to get loans, which adds more stress to the economy. I cant tell you precisely when this recession will come to roost, but it feels likes its coming, said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer of PNC Asset Management Group. And the market is not priced for it. I dont want to be dramatic and say a day of reckoning is coming, but there will be a wake-up call. Agati is expecting only a modest recession, not a deeply painful one like the downturns following the 2007-08 financial crisis and the 2020 onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. But she is concerned by how high the stock market has climbed, driven in particular by just a small handful of stocks. How to recession-proof your life amid economic uncertainty This is the market thinking were going to muddle along and then the Fed is going to get out of the drivers seat: The Fed is going to cut rates, and were going to power into 2024, Agati said. And I think thats awfully delusional. She says rates could climb higher than Wall Street expects and stay high for longer than investors are forecasting because inflation has remained too stubbornly high. The wide expectations among traders is that the Fed will hold interest rates steady at its meeting next week. If it does, that will be the first meeting where the Fed hasnt hiked rates in more than a year. After that, the widespread bet is that the Fed may raise rates one more time in July before going on hold or even cutting rates by the end of the year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Adobe rose another 3.4% to add to its 5% leap from the day before following its announcement of a new artificial-intelligence offering for businesses. It joined a frenzy around AI that has sent a select group of stocks soaring, such as a 165% surge for chipmaker Nvidia so far this year. Proponents say <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-03-31/column-afraid-of-ai-the-startups-selling-it-want-you-to-be">AI</a></p>  will be the next revolution to remake the economy, while critics say its inflating the next bubble. Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to beEuropean markets were lower and Asian markets closed higher overnight.Trading has been listless throughout the week amid a lack of any big market-moving reports or news. The benchmark S&amp;P index still gained enough ground by Thursday to close 20% above its October low, officially entering a new bull market.Technology stocks, which have been responsible for much of Wall Street's gains, helped lead the way on Friday. Microsoft rose 1.4% and chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 gives more weight to many Big Tech companies because of their size. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.74% from 3.72% late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.62% from 4.52%.The latest round of corporate earnings reports is nearing a close, but late reports are still managing to move some stocks. Ski resort operator Vail Resorts fell 6.9% after reporting disappointing results. DocuSign rose 1.8% after reporting strong earnings.Wall Street will have more potentially market-moving economic updates to deal with next week. The government will release May data for inflation at the consumer level on Tuesday and retail sales data on Thursday. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest update on interest rates.AP Business Wwriter Yuri Kageyama contributed  to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Why would the undisputed king of the hardware space want to wade into this territory at all?</p><p>It cant just be about sunk costs  Apple has <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a26037725/apple-kills-self-driving-car-project-titan/">killed costly internal projects</a> before, rather than ship an unpopular and potentially unsuccessful product. Apple must genuinely believe that theres a future in headset computing, and that it looks nothing like the failed fantasies of the metaverse thus far.</p><p>I put the question </p> to<p> David Karpf, a professor of media and public affairs at George Washington University</p>,<p> and the author of a newsletter called <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/">The Future, Now and Then</a>, who has paid special attention to the development of headset technologies.</p><p>Im of two minds about this headset, he told me. In the near-term, I think it wont do any better than the Oculus/Meta Quest. There simply isnt much to </p>do<p> with Apples Goggles, and at $3,500 not a lot of people are going to buy it just to tinker around. And yet, </p>while  although<p> he expects the Vision Pro to flop initially, he thinks its technical breakthroughs might matter a decade from now.</p><p>Reviews of the Vision Pro have echoed precisely this point  theyve been positive on the specs, but mixed on the application. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23750003/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-the-best-headset-demo-ever">The Verges Nilay Patel praised</a> the next-level resolution and computing power, the seamlessness of the experience  but still asked what it might all be for. The most perfect headset demo reel of all time is still just a headset demo reel, he wrote.</p> Column: How tech is changing L.A.  and how L.A. is changing tech<p>The question very much remains: What will most people actually want to do with a virtual reality headset?</p><p>For Meta, there was at least one answer: Play games. Gaming remains the key driver for VR technology, and really, the only widely proven use case thus far. Millions of users play games </p>like  such as<p> "Beat Saber" and "No Mans Sky"  thats millions more than hang out on Metas Horizon rooms. </p><p>Gaming was, incidentally, probably what made Zuckerberg think the metaverse might work: "Roblox," "Fortnite</p>,<p>" and "Second Life" are basically </p>2D  2-D<p> metaverses. And gaming is the only thing that keeps Metas virtual reality ambitions from unraveling </p>completely<p>. Notably, gaming is social, or at least parasocial.</p><p>But by shipping without controllers, Apple is all but admitting its not interested in tackling that market. Its all about watching movies, doing meditation apps, and working your design job in augmented reality. In easily its least appealing feature, users can FaceTime with uncanny valley avatars of users faces  thats really the only time users get </p>out <p>of Apples spatial enclosure. There might be some captivating and fascinating programs, but you will be experiencing them by yourself, on Apples terms alone.</p><p>These are two very different visions for the future of headset computing; in fact theyre almost polar opposites. Metas ambition was for a wild, interconnected world where, in theory, other tech companies would build metaverse spaces that bisected its own. It was to be a digital alternate reality, a world of endless possibilities.</p><p>The problem was that few believed even for a second that Facebook, the company famous for harvesting your personal data to sell to advertisers and letting toxic misinformation run rampant on its platform, would be in any position to steward such a world into existence. The vision was curdled right out the gate, and the bad graphics and embarrassing demos only helped speed its demise.</p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg<p>Apples approach seems to be a more restrained one  bridging the gap between iPhone and spatial reality with familiar apps and gesture interactions. Still, I dont know about you, but when I watch the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX9qSaGXFyg">Vision Pro commercial</a>, of people in planes, living rooms, in the kitchen with their children, disappearing into a totally immersive computer on their face  one whose content we know, because its Apple, will be strictly vetted and controlled  it depresses me.</p><p>We might venture a guess at what Apples anti-metaverse will look like by taking out our phones right now, looking at our apps, and imagine physically existing among them. For Disney+ that might be fun, for a while, and ditto with your photos and movies. Just about everything else, Im about close enough to already, thanks. In fact  and I cant imagine Im the only one  Id rather not</p> <p>disappear any further into my phone.</p><p>That these kinds of immersive digital worlds, whether closed or open, would rise to prominence was always <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7eqbb/the-metaverse-has-always-been-a-dystopia">a dystopian idea</a>, one that originated in cyberpunk fiction, premised on the notion that conditions in the real world were so bad that users had to abandon their actual lives completely and escape into a more poorly rendered simulacrum.</p><p>This is precisely why Karpf thinks that computers-on-your-face might have a future after all. If the world keeps getting worse, he says, this will eventually have a lot of appeal.</p> If Apples vision wins out, the fear is that well all sink into our cypberpunk home theater goggles, consuming content <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-07/wildfire-smoke-canada-wildfires-east-coast-new-york-air-quality">     as the world burns  </a></p>   its almost enough to make you wish for the metaverse.Well all sink into our cypberpunk home theaters, consuming content <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-06-07/wildfire-smoke-canada-wildfires-east-coast-new-york-air-quality">as the world burns</a></p>  its almost enough to make you wish for the metaverse.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

It also helps that Bluesky grew out of Twitter  a pet project of former CEO Jack Dorsey, who still sits on its board of directors.</p><p>It was designed to replace Twitter, said Sol Messing, who worked at Twitter as a data scientist until January and is now associate professor at New York University's Center for Social Media and Politics. And you can see it in the way that the </p>the <p>system is designed. It works like Twitter.</p><p>But can Bluesky replace Twitter? Prominent Twitter users such as the model Chrissy Teigen, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Dril, a humorous account that grew out of weird Twitter and has been poking fun at Musk since the billionaire took over the platform, are active users. Journalists, academics and politicians  the users who helped make Twitter into the culture's zeitgeist  are also flocking to the app (if they can score invite codes).</p><p>Really wondering about where the line is to leave the other place, wrote  or skeeted Ocasio-Cortez recently, expressing concern about how Musk's Twitter will handle next year's presidential elections. There's a line where the harm of unchecked disinfo exceeds the benefits of direct, authentic communication. It's really sad. </p><p>Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to simply supplant Twitter. Beyond the social network itself, it is building the technical foundation  what it calls a protocol for public conversation"  that could make social networks work more like email, blogs or phone numbers. </p> Thinking of quitting Twitter? Here's everything you should know<p>In computer science, protocols are technical rules for processing and transmitting data, shared standards to which everyone agrees to adhere. Without the TCP/IP protocol, for instance, we wouldnt have the internet. </p><p>When you call someone on the phone, it doesnt matter if they use Verizon or AT&amp;T or Cricket Wireless  as long as their phone has service, they can pick up and talk to you. But on Facebook, or TikTok, or Twitter, you cant cross over to another social network to leave a comment on someones account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services.</p><p>Theres no crossing over  no interoperability. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models. Your Twitter friends are your Twitter friends, and if you move on to a new social network, you cant easily bring them with you  if you can bring them at all. Bluesky is trying to reimagine all this. Moonshot or delusion, what is clear is that invites to the Bluesky social networking app are hot commodity, some even offered on eBay for $100 or more. </p><p>But as everyone  including Musk, who paid $44 billion for Twitter  knows, a social network's value is not simply in the technology behind it. It is in the people  the network of people who use and contribute to a platform. And getting people, especially people who aren't teenagers, to move to a new social network, is quite a challenge. Just ask Mastodon, Truth Social or any other alternative network that's sprung up more recently. </p><p>We are all active on Twitter because we are all active on Twitter. And so its very, very difficult to </p>to<p> migrate to a different social media platform once you have thousands of followers on Twitter, said Messing, who also worked on data science at Facebook and the Pew Research Center. </p><p>While it seems unlikely that Bluesky could replace Twitter as a global information conduit any time soon, it is more intuitive and easy to use than 7-year-old Mastodon, which not long ago was touted as a possible Twitter replacement but which many find befuddlingly complicated and lacking in important features. While it looks and feels similar to Twitter, Bluesky lacks many of the features Twitter has built out over the years. There is no way to send direct messages, for instance, and there is no verification system.</p> Former employees sue Twitter over layoffs, alleging violation of labor laws<p>For now, Bluesky is like the back room at a house party where the cool kids and misfits found refuge from the increasingly rowdy rager out front  at least until it, too, is enveloped by chaos. Fewer than 100,000 people are on it right now. That's by design. </p><p>Once you open it up and allow different forms of content moderation to dominate, its going to be a very different platform, Messing said. </p><p>Bluesky's approach to content moderation is similar to its approach to algorithms to decide what users see. That is, giving users a choice in what they see. The app launched with a chronological feed, meaning you see posts in the order they are posted in. Other social platforms like TikTok, Facebook, Instagram or Twitter use secretive algorithms to show you what youre more likely to be interested in. Bluesky also has custom feeds, which let users pick the algorithm that controls what they see. </p><p>Imagine you want your timeline to only be posts from your mutuals, or only posts that have cat photos, or only posts related to sports  you can simply pick your feed of choice from an open marketplace, CEO Jay Graber wrote in a recent <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">blog post</a>. Bluesky did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>It's an open question whether Bluesky will soar or remain a pie in the sky. But some of Twitter's earliest supporters are cautiously optimistic. After all, Twitter started out similarly small, and along the way both its creators and users learned a lot. </p> Twitter advertiser pause widens as General Mills taps the brakes<p>Theres a whole community of people doing these experiments at these projects that are all learning from each other and sharing things back and forth and with the overall hope and idea that we cannot make the same mistakes we made last time, said Evan Rabble Henshaw-Plath, who worked on Twitter predecessor Odeo with Dorsey and is now CEO of Planetary.Social, another decentralized social network. </p><p>In some ways, we democratized the media. We changed the world. We gave everyone a voice. But we didnt figure out what to do with that, he said. We didnt give ourselves great tools to handle it.</p><p>Could Bluesky be the Twitter do-over it was set up to be? </p><p>I would like to see these guys figure out a smart way to maintain data portability, without losing the ability to essentially moderate content, Henshaw-Plath said. And yeah, that might be impossible, but thats what I would ultimately like to see. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Despite a more than <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24165/w24165.pdf">threefold increase in productivity</a> since, the 40-hour week has remained unchanged for 83 years.</p><p>But it may be changing at last. 2023 could just be the year of the four-day, 32-hour week.</p><p>Over the first few months of the year, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F04f_zwh&amp;hl=en">Google searches</a> for information about the four-day week rose by a factor of five. The media have produced hundreds of stories on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-16/whats-a-four-day-workweek-like-these-california-employees-tell-you">companies that are offering 32-hour schedules</a>. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-04-08/proposed-bill-could-make-california-the-first-state-to-implement-a-4-day-workweek">California</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/4-day-workweek-states-considering-legislation/">other states</a> have considered legislation to enact or study a four-day week, and Riverside Rep. Mark Takano has introduced a bill on the subject in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1332?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%22%5D%7D&amp;s=4&amp;r=1">Congress</a>.</p><p>In Europe, national and regional governments have pilot four-day week programs in progress, and the United Arab Emirates has shifted public-sector employees to a 4 -day schedule. In February, we released findings from the <a href="https://autonomy.work/portfolio/uk4dwpilotresults/#:~:text=%27Before%20and%20after%27%20data%20shows,improved%20across%20the%20trial%20period">worlds largest trial of a four-day week</a> with no reduction in pay, involving some 60 organizations in Britain across a range of sectors from public relations to healthcare to manufacturing. The results were striking: Employees and companies using the new schedule are thriving.</p><p>Why are reduced working hours suddenly on the agenda after years of not being taken seriously? The most important reason is the pandemic.</p><p>Leaders of the first organization to be part of our research attributed their decision to the COVID-driven shift to remote work. </p> Dr.<p> Adam Husney, the chief executive of the health information firm Healthwise, explained: Once we realized we could trust our employees with </p>where<p> they work, we also realized we could trust them about how much </p>time<p> they work.</p><p>Before the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about paying people for their output rather than their hours, but organizations honored the principle mostly in the breach. Once people are off-site, however, paying for productivity rather than time makes more sense, as least for employees who arent subject to draconian surveillance measures.</p><p>The pandemic also turbo-charged the four-day week by creating much more hardship for workers. While the work-life interface was difficult to navigate before COVID, the contagion itself and the complications of merging work and family life led to record levels of stress. The latest published research from Future Forum, based on a 2022 survey, found that 42% of employees polled in the United States and five other countries said they were <a href="https://futureforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Future-Forum-Pulse-Report-Winter-2022-2023.pdf">burned out</a>, a 4-percentage-point increase compared with just a year earlier.</p><p>Workers are responding with their feet. For Healthwises Husney, a staff exodus in June 2021 was the impetus for closing on Fridays. The labor market is experiencing not only the so-called Great Resignation  record numbers of people quitting their jobs  but also extremely high numbers of unfilled positions. Organizations are having difficulty retaining workers and scrambling to fill openings.</p><p>Raising pay isnt always enough, and not all organizations can afford to do so. Turnover is also extremely expensive. Its one reason much of the interest in the four-day workweek is coming from healthcare organizations, where burnout and resignations among nurses have become endemic.</p><p>We also think a quieter evolution away from the five-day schedule is underway. Many organizations have already reduced summer schedules by shortening or eliminating Friday hours. No-meeting Fridays have enabled more remote workers to take some of the day for themselves under the radar. We discovered that Friday morning classes at an exercise studio in our area have become very popular, thanks partly to people who reported being at work.</p><p>Our research suggests that the four-day, 32-hour week is not only feasible; its <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/research">better for workers and employers</a>.</p><p>In collaboration with the nonprofit <a href="https://www.4dayweek.com/" target="_blank">4 Day Week Global</a>, weve been tracking what happens when companies switch to the curtailed schedule with no reduction in pay after a two-month process of figuring out how to maintain productivity and performance. Weve found that employee well-being is markedly improved. Of more than 100 companies with thousands of workers around the world, nearly 70% experienced reduced rates of burnout.</p><p>Stress fell. Reported physical and mental health improved. People felt less anxious and fatigued, exercised more and slept better. Their life satisfaction rose, and conflicts among work, family and life plummeted.</p><p>But its not just workers who benefited. On a 10-point scale, companies rated the success of the trials at a robust 8.5 or higher. Perhaps the most persuasive metric </p>of all<p> is that most are opting to continue with the shorter schedule. Only a handful of the organizations that have participated in the trials have reverted to the five-day week.</p><p>Many will </p>of course <p>continue to oppose a shortened work schedule because it sounds un-American or unprofitable. But were finding out that modern challenges make the four-day workweek not only possible but better for workers, employers and society.</p>Juliet Schor is a professor of sociology and Wen Fan is an associate professor of sociology at Boston College.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Vision Pro will sell for $3,500 once it's released in stores early next year. </p> Its an impressive piece of technology, but it was almost like a tease,  said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen    said.  It looked like the beginning of a very long journey. Instead of merely positioning the goggles as another vehicle for exploring virtual worlds or watching more immersive entertainment, Apple framed the Vision Pro as the equivalent of owning an ultrahigh-definition TV, surround-sound system, high-end camera and state-of-the-art camera bundled into a single piece of hardware. We believe it is a stretch, even for Apple, to assume consumers would pay a similar amount for an AR/VR headset as they would for a combination of those products, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a Monday research note. Despite such skepticism, <p>the headset could become another milestone in Apples lore of releasing game-changing technology, even though the company hasnt always been the first to try its hand at making a particular device.</p> Column: Two Uber drivers read the fine print  and won millions for California gig workers<p>Apple's lineage of breakthroughs </p>date  dates back <p>to a bow-tied Jobs peddling the first Mac in 1984  a tradition that continued with the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, the iPad in 2010, the Apple Watch in 2014 and its AirPods in 2016.</p><p>The company emphasized that it drew upon its </p>past  previous<p> decades of product design during the years it spent working on the Vision Pro, which Apple said involved more than 5,000 </p>different<p> patents. The goggles will be equipped with 12 cameras, six microphones and </p> a<p> variety of sensors that will allow users to control it and various apps with just their eyes and hands. Apple also developed a technology to create </p> athree-dimensional  3-D<p> digital version of each user to display during video conferencing. </p> Although Vision Pro wont require physical controllers that can be clunky to use, the goggles will have to  either be plugged into either a power outlet or a portable battery tethered to the headset  a factor that could make it less attractive for some users. Theyve worked hard to make this headset as integrated into the real world as current technology allows, but its still a headset, said Insider Intelligence analyst Yory Wurmser, who nevertheless described the unveiling as a fairly mind-blowing presentation. Even so, analysts are not expecting the Vision Pro to be a big hit right away. Thats largely because of the hefty price, but also because most people still cant see a compelling reason to wear something wrapped around their face for an extended period  of time.<p>If the new device turns out to be a niche product, it would leave Apple in the same bind as other major tech companies and startups that have tried selling headsets or glasses equipped with technology that</p> either<p> thrusts people into artificial worlds or projects digital images with scenery and things that are actually in front of them.</p>  a format known as augmented reality.<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been describing these alternate </p>three-dimensional  3-D <p>realities as the metaverse. It's a geeky concept that he tried to push into the mainstream by changing the name of his social networking company to Meta Platforms in 2021 and then pouring billions of dollars into improving the virtual technology.</p><p>But <a href="https://apnews.com/article/metaverse-mobile-world-congress-mwc-a19b0eb269dc58df44f31b0970d83c4b">the metaverse largely remains a digital ghost town</a>, although Meta's virtual reality headset, the Quest, remains the top-selling device in a category that </p>so far <p>has mostly appealed to video game players looking for even more immersive experiences. Cook and other Apple executives avoided referring to the metaverse in their presentations, describing the Vision Pro as the company's first leap into spatial computing instead.</p> Dating in L.A. is exhausting, so I asked a chatbot to flirt for me. Things got weird fast<p>The response to virtual, augmented and mixed reality has been decidedly ho-hum</p> so far<p>. Some of the gadgets deploying the technology have </p>even<p> been derisively mocked, with the most notable example being Google's internet-connected glasses released more than a decade ago.</p><p>After Google co-founder Sergey Brin initially drummed up excitement about the device by demonstrating an early model's potential wow factor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE">with a skydiving stunt staged during a San Francisco tech conference</a>, consumers quickly became turned off to a product that allowed its users to surreptitiously take pictures and video. The backlash became so intense that people who wore the gear became known as Glassholes, leading Google to withdraw the product a few years after its debut.</p><p>Microsoft also has had limited success with HoloLens, a mixed-reality headset released in 2016, although the software maker <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/mixed-reality-blog/microsoft-committed-to-hololens-2-and-mixed-reality/ba-p/3732405">earlier this year insisted it remains committed to the technology</a>. </p><p>Magic Leap, a startup that stirred excitement with previews of a mixed-reality technology that could conjure <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbpqwUUfMAQ">the spectacle of a whale breaching through a gymnasium floor</a>, had so much trouble marketing its first headset to consumers in 2018 that it has since shifted its focus to industrial, healthcare and emergency uses. </p> Daniel Diez, Magic Leap's chief transformation officer, said there are four major questions Apple's goggles will have to answer: What can people do with it? What does this thing look and feel like? Is it comfortable to wear? And how much is it going to cost? Column: How tech is changing L.A.  and how L.A. is changing tech The anticipation that Apple's goggles are going to sell for several thousand dollars already has dampened expectations for the product. Although he expects Apple's goggles to boast jaw dropping technology, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said he expects the company to sell just 150,000 units during the device's first year on the market  a mere speck in the company's portfolio.  By comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million of its marquee iPhones a year. But the iPhone wasn't an immediate sensation, with sales of fewer than 12 million units in its first full year on the market. Since 2016, the average annual shipments of virtual- and augmented-reality devices have averaged 8.6 million units, according to the research firm CCS Insight. The firm expects <p><a href="https://www.ccsinsight.com/company-news/extended-reality-pace-slowed-by-economic-woes/">     sales to remain sluggish this year,  </a></p>  with a sales projection of about 11 million of the devices before gradually climbing to 67 million in 2026. Before taking the wraps of its new goggles, Apple kicked off the event by announcing that the latest models of two high-end computer lines, the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, will be powered by a company-designed chip that has already been available in less-expensive Macs. The Mac Studio will sell for $2,000 and the Mac Pro will be priced at $7,000. As it typically does at this conference, Apple provided a peek at the next iPhone operating system, iOS 17. That software, which will include more personalization and location-sharing tools for phone calls and texting, is expected to be released as a free update in September.Liedtke writes for the Associated Press.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Only two weeks ago, its </p>CEO  chief executive,<p> Brian Cornell, was boasting that "our long-standing commitment to diversity, and equity, and inclusion ... has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-ceo-dei-fueled-much-221502055.html" target="_blank">fueled much of our growth</a> over the last nine years."</p><p>Yet when the braying mob of anti-LGBTQ+ reactionaries targeted Target, the company folded like a cheap, off-the-rack suit. It told personnel in many stores to <a href="https://time.com/6282522/target-backlash-lgbtq-merchandise-removal/" target="_blank">shrink or even eliminate their Pride-themed merchandise displays</a> or move them to less conspicuous sections of the stores. Some LGBTQ+ designers say their products have been taken off the shelves. </p><p>Target explained its reaction by <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/25/targets-ceo-lgbtq-themed-goods-protest-pride-month/" target="_blank">citing physical threats</a> to its store workers from anti-LGBTQ+ militants. But something more is going on here, and Target's response doesn't show the company in a good light. </p><p>The context is a concerted effort from the right wing to demonize the LGBTQ+ movement and thereby make any outreach or even acknowledgment of this community toxic for consumer businesses. The goal is to disappear these people and their advocates, reversing a decades-long trend toward acceptance, equity and inclusion.</p> "Our long-standing commitment to diversity, and equity, and inclusion...has fueled much of our growth over the last nine years."<p>The attacks take many forms, all of them chiefly employed by Republicans and their right-wing acolytes and all of them equally factitious. </p><p>Sometimes LGBTQ+ people are accused of being pedophiles </p> who<p> "groom</p>ing<p>" children for abuse. Sometimes the </p>the <p>anti-queer movement is cast as an arm of the right's attack on "wokeness," which is just another way of promoting the idea that only straight white males count in this U.S. of A. </p><figure class="op-interactive"> <iframe width="658" height="658" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/CstK62iOPYm/embed"></iframe></figure> Anti-"wokeness" is the chief theme of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis'  Presidential    presidential  ambition tour. As is well known, DeSantis has been on the warpath with  the Walt Disney Co. mpany, one of his state's leading employers and economic engines, over the company's public criticism of his so-called "Don't Say Gay" law, which suppresses classroom references to gender identity.  (During his <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-05-24/ron-desantis-and-elon-musk-give-us-a-preview-of-the-chaos-of-a-desantis-presidency">     glitch-beleaguered May 24    Presidential        presidential    campaign launch  </a></p>  on Twitter, DeSantis ludicrously accused Disney of "trying to inject matters of sex into the programming for the youth.)<p>There's no evidence that anti-queer militants constitute </p>comprise <p>anything but a tiny minority of the American public. When they act in concert and their efforts </p> are<p> fueled by social media, however, they can appear to be weightier than they are. </p><p>That's probably what accounted for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-25/anti-transgender-backlash-against-bud-light-explained">the pusillanimous reaction of Anheuser-Busch</a> to a right-wing, social-media-driven campaign against its Bud Light beer, after the company's marketing department launched a publicity campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. </p> Column: Corporate America's deafening silence on the Texas abortion law<p>Anheuser-Busch not only issued a wan statement of regret for the marketing outreach but also sidelined the two marketing executives responsible for the campaign. </p> Given that their assignment had been to revive the brand's fading popularity, Anheuser-Busch's effective demotion of the executives signaled to the boycotters that their voices had been heard. That wasn't a positive corporate message, to say the least. <p>Anheuser-Busch stock has fallen about 20% in the last two months, while the boycott has been in full cry. Target shares have fallen by about the same percentage since mid-May.</p><p>To some extent, it's unfair to blame the far right for launching boycotts against brands they choose not to like. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-nra-boycotts-20180226-story.html">I've defended consumer boycotts</a> in the past, in principle. But all boycotts are not created equal. </p><p>There's a qualitative difference between those directed at noxious behavior, such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-tucker-carlson-boycott-20190111-story.html">the open racism of Tucker Carlson</a> or the bloodlust of the National Rifle Ass</p>ociatio<p>n., and those directed at efforts </p>at  to promote<p> tolerance and equality. One knows boycotters by their boycottees. </p><p>That brings us back to the companies' hasty responses. These have been widely misjudged. Alex Shepherd of </p>The  the<p> New Republic cursed </p>Anheuser-Bush and Target for their <p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173073/right-wing-war-bug-light-target" target="_blank">"total, preemptive capitulation"</a> </p> by Anheuser-Bush and Target for their <p>to the anti-LGBTQ+ boycotts as "profoundly un-American."</p><p>If only they were. Corporate America's response to even a hint of controversy, no matter how specious the boycotters' objections, is as American as apple pie. As we've seen time and time again, consumer companies are notable not for their steadfastness in defending the public interest, but their cravenness. That's especially so when, as is the case with the </p> Bud Light Busch <p>and Target campaigns, the context is overtly partisan.</p><p>Remember all the companies that pledged to cease or at least suspend campaign contributions to the 147 Republican representatives and senators who voted to overturn the 2020 </p>Presidential  presidential <p>election? Many, if not most, have <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/fortune-500-company-election-deniers-jan-6/" target="_blank">gone back on their promise.</a> </p><p>Among them, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/fortune-500-company-election-deniers-jan-6/" target="_blank">according to ProPublica,</a> are Home Depot, which by the end of 2022 had donated to 65 of the election deniers, and Boeing, which funded at least 74. Toyota, to give it begrudging credit, was at least candid about the thought process involved in resuming contributions to supporters of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection: It selected politicians that could carry its water in Washington. </p> Column: The Tucker Carlson advertiser boycott continues, and what's wrong with that?<p>Toyota supports candidates based on their position on issues that are important to the auto industry and the company, the company <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-06-28/hiltzik-toyota-political-donations-insurrection-congress">told me in June 2021.</a> </p> We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification."<p> To put it another way, "money talks, democratic principle walks."</p> Many corporations will say for the record that they believe in women's healthcare rights. But when a horrifically punitive antiabortion law went into effect in Texas in 2021, <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-09-07/corporate-america-silence-on-the-texas-abortion-law">     the silence from the corporate community  </a></p>  was deafening. It still is; not a peep of protest has come from Texas-based big businesses such as American Airlines, Texas Instruments, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise  even though the law is certain to make recruiting women for important jobs harder for them.<p>One problem in assessing the campaigns against Bud Light and Target is a lack of clarity about their results. It's hard to be sure whether Bud Light's continuing sales slump is due to the anti-woke publicity or to the fact that, not to be indelicate, the product tastes like it's been strained through a horse</p> isn't entirely clear<p>.</p><p>Target muddied the waters in its own case by explaining that it minimized the displays of Pride-themed merchandise to protect its employees from violence. </p> There are, of course, other ways to achieve that end, including by stepping up security in vulnerable stores and making clear that it will prosecute the hell out of anyone who commits or threatens to commit an assault on its premises. <p>Target has also let it be known that the merchandise it removed from inventory was from a single British designer whose work has exploited satanic imagery. The company's website, anyway, is <a href="https://www.target.com/c/pride/-/N-5589f?lnk=snav_rd_pride" target="_blank">replete with Pride-themed goods.</a></p><p>One would hope that companies that become objects of ideologically</p>-<p> inspired campaigns like these don't think they can mollify the torch-bearing mob. If they think they can immunize themselves, they can take a lesson from the experience of Chick-fil-A. </p><p>The fast-food chain became the target of localized boycotts in 2012, when CEO Dan Cathy publicly voiced the conviction that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-chickfila-president-crossed-a-danger-line-20130108-column.html">gay marriage violated Gods plan.</a></p> https://twitter.com/JeffClarkUS/status/1663546041327820801<p>Progressive politicians in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago, among other places, threatened to ban Chick-fil-A stores from their jurisdictions. Calls for boycotts erupted on Facebook and Twitter. The company issued a statement disavowing Cathy's viewpoint as a matter of corporate policy. A sort of reverse boycott occurred, in the form of a one-day eat-in by company fans at Chick-fil-A stores.</p><p>But the political environment has changed. Recently it became known that Chick-fil-A had appointed a vice</p>-<p> president for diversity, equity and inclusion  in 2021. (Moreover, the VP is Black.) The discovery has inspired a new campaign for a boycott, this time from the right wing. </p>As <p>One acolyte of Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffClarkUS/status/1663546041327820801" target="_blank">tweeted</a>, "Disappointing. Et tu Chik-fil-A?" </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Fundamentally, short sellers follow the traditional investment advice to buy low and sell high</p>,<p> but reverse the order of those steps: </p> T<p>hey sell high, in the expectation that they will ultimately be able to buy low, pocketing the difference between the sale and purchase prices of their investments.

Column: With demands for a bank bailout, Silicon Valley shows its 'small government' mantra was just a pose<p>Short selling is not illegal, and as we'll see it's, in fact, healthy for the markets. Critics of short sellers sometimes emphasize "naked" short selling  selling shares one hasn't borrowed  as the real cause of damage to the markets, but that's not always illegal either. </p><p>Short investors aren't always required to have borrowed shares before selling them; it's alright if they can show they've done something like a "locate," meaning that they've identified shares they can eventually borrow to complete their transaction if necessary. It's only when shorts sell shares they don't ever intend to borrow that the SEC will charge them with illegal naked shorting, but that's a very rare occurrence.</p><p>To its credit, the SEC seldom takes campaigns to restrict short selling very seriously. The agency has pledged to launch an investigation into </p> whether <p>this year's downdraft in bank stocks is due to market manipulation. But there's little evidence that the agency is doing more than trying to mollify bank managements fretting that <a href="https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Overview/KRX" target="_blank">a widely followed index of regional banking shares</a> has fallen by about 33% since the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>Short selling is an appropriate strategy if you believe or fear that a stocks price is headed down. But it goes against the grain: Selling something you dont own smacks, at first blush, of a confidence scheme. </p><p>It's also very risky: If you own a stock, you can only lose what you invested, but your potential gain if the stock goes up is theoretically unlimited. If you short a stock, your potential gain is limited to what you collected by selling the borrowed shares, even if the stock falls to zero; but your potential </p>loss<p> is infinite, if the stock rises instead of falls.</p><p>The interplay between optimism and pessimism is what makes markets, just as it does horse races. That's no less true when optimism and pessimism go to extremes, as they often do. </p><p>History documents a long-term preference in financial markets for optimism, broken by occasional outbreaks of fear trending toward panic; that's why stock investment returns handsomely exceed inflation (over the </p>very<p> long term). </p><p>Corporate managements have no right to expect optimists always to prevail. The optimists are not invariably right, after all. They are, however, typically more numerous than pessimists. That's because investors with negative views of a company's future don't normally short its stock; they simply don't invest in it.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e0/79/ed153276404a8fe7a9d8d56da816/shorts.jpg"></figure><p>Short selling is an indispensable counterbalance to the general sunniness about a company's prospects that issue from executive suites. Short sellers have helped to expose not a few fraudulent or incompetent managements, most notably when the veteran short seller <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1004916006978550640" target="_blank">James Chanos blew the whistle on Enron in 2000-01</a>.</p><p>Proposals to ban or limit short selling in selected companies or industries arise persistently on Wall Street, even though the evidence is strong that they don't work to stem downdrafts.</p><p>During the financial crisis of September 2008, for instance, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-211.htm" target="_blank">the SEC temporarily banned short selling in 799 financial stocks</a> </p>to <p>"to protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded</a> in a 2012 study that "the bans had little impact on stock prices," because "even with the bans in place, prices continued to fall." </p><p>The bans did, however, raise</p>d<p> trading costs by about $1 billion, largely because the bans prevented market makers such as New York Stock Exchange floor brokers from engaging in the short-term shorting they relied on to balance their trading books.</p><p>Short-selling bans, the New York Fed warned, also "prevent ... short-sellers from rooting out cases of fraud and earnings manipulation."</p> Taking aim at short-sellers, but misfiring<p>Almost inevitably, when corporate managements bellyache about short selling, their shares are under pressure for fundamental reasons, such as management ineptitude or dishonesty. </p><p>Lehman </p>Brothers Bros.<p> Chairman and CEO Dick Fuld, for example, aired out the naked short-selling excuse when trying to explain why his Wall Street firm failed in 2008, helping to trigger the financial crisis that year. </p><p>The truth was that Lehman under Fuld was <a href="https://ritholtz.com/2015/06/the-delusional-dick-fuld/" target="_blank">spectacularly mismanaged</a>, bristling with accounting gimmicks that concealed, at least temporarily, the horrible misjudgments and business choices that led to its demise. Shorts, especially naked shorts, had nothing to do with it.</p><p>Elon Musk has been on a seemingly permanent warpath against short sellers of Tesla shares. Back in April 2022, he erupted in fury at Bill Gates, who was reported to have accumulated a $500-million short position in the electric car maker's shares. Musk accused Gates of betting in favor of global warming by undermining Tesla stock. </p><p>At the time, Tesla shares were trading at a split-adjusted price of about $335. As of this writing, they're floating below $199, for a decline of more than 40%. Maybe Gates knew something that Musk either didn't know about Tesla</p>,<p> or wasn't saying.</p><p>The idea that short sellers are determined to undermine deserving companies purely for profit isn't unusual. A great example emerged a few years ago related to stock in the Washington-area biotech firm Northwest Biotherapeutics, which is in the business of developing cancer drugs. </p><p>Northwest's supporters, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/northwest-biotherapeutics-stock-woes-highlight-the-harm-of-short-sales/2014/09/26/78b99b0a-4507-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html" target="_blank">a Washington Post financial columnist</a>, got it into their heads that Wall Street hedge funds and Adam Feuerstein, a reporter for TheStreet.com, were somehow in cahoots to drive the company's shares lower. </p><p>This was an example of how short sellers worked to "stifle innovation and damage the economy in their relentless pursuit of short-term trading profits," in the Post's words.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-apr-09-fi-hiltzik9-story.html">I wrote at the time</a>, this smelled like nonsense. Feuerstein's reports were well-informed and properly skeptical. Northwest Bio was trading at about $5 a share at the time of the brouhaha over short selling. Today it's about 60 cents. </p><p>In its latest annual report, issued in February, the company acknowledged that it has never turned a profit since its inception in 1996. "We may never achieve or sustain profitability," it said. Sounds like the shorts had it right.</p><p>That brings us back to the agitation for a short-selling ban on bank stocks. The American Bankers Assn</p> .'s letter to Gensler<p> is a masterpiece of the genre. It wrings its figurative hands over short sales that "do not appear to reflect the issuers' financial status or general industry conditions."</p><p>Indeed, the bankers say, short sales have followed "relatively favorable earnings reports." The letter complains about "extensive social media engagement about the health of various banks ... disconnected from the underlying financial realities."</p><p>In truth, the underlying financial reality of commercial banks is that they live on a knife edge that in any other sector would suggest impending disaster. </p> Column: Valeant scandal shows why we need short-sellers in the stock market<p>Put simply, they fund long-term investments with short-term borrowings. That is, they invest in assets such as long-term loans, Treasury securities and mortgages with durations as long as 30 years, backed by customer deposits that can be withdrawn at any moment by a single phone call or the click of a mouse.</p><p>That's precisely the practice that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/thread/2023/the-banking-crisis">brought down Silicon Valley Bank and others</a> that crashed in recent weeks: Depositors pulled billions of dollars in deposits, leaving the banks stranded with assets that had cratered in real value because interest rates had risen rapidly.</p><p>The "relatively favorable earnings reports" of many banks were based on sleight-of-hand, which investors finally noticed. The banks acknowledged on their balance sheets that they had losses pending on assets they were poised to sell into a falling market. But they didn't count unrealized losses on assets that they planned to hold to maturity, when they'd be guaranteed to get their original investments back.</p><p>When the deposits fled, investors quite naturally took a closer look at those supposedly secure assets, and realized that in real, fundamental terms the banks were insolvent. That they started selling shares was as natural a reaction as your knee twitching when the doctor tests your reflexes.</p><p>Tellingly, the ABA letter never specifies what it means by short sellers' "manipulation and abuse" that it wants the SEC to stamp out. </p><p>The bankers say they want to "restore investor confidence." If that's so, they're barking up the wrong tree. Nothing will undermine investor confidence more than the impression that the nation's chief financial regulator is out to rig the markets to favor executives looking for a free hand to paint their companies as positively as they wish, the truth be damned. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

In negotiations between the Biden White House and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Republican caucus, one of the last sticking points was whether, and by how much, to tighten work requirements for food stamps and welfare.</p><p>In coming days, as Congress moves toward votes on the deal, political commentators will thoroughly masticate the question of whether Biden or McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) prevailed in this dealmaking and which of them will be hurt or harmed politically by the outcome. </p> Democrats right now are willing to default on the debt so they can continue making welfare payments for people that are refusing to work.<p>That's not a very interesting parlor game. (Personally, I'd go with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173036/debt-limit-talks-spell-doom-kevin-mccarthy" target="_blank">the judgment of Timothy Noah</a> of the New Republic, who thinks Biden emerges as the political victor and McCarthy's days as speaker are numbered, thanks to the choler of his far right wing.) </p><p>More important is what the deal says about the principles of both camps. The granular details of the agreement were still murky Sunday, and it could still collapse because of objections from congressional Republicans or Democrats. </p><p>The deal, as reported, freezes discretionary federal spending  that is, most of the programs for which Americans depend on the federal government  at current levels for the next two years, with increases lower than inflation. That means an effective budget cut, relative to inflation. In return, the debt ceiling is suspended for two years.</p><p>But Biden managed to preserve the accomplishments of his presidency thus far from the GOP's knives. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-26/the-gops-debt-ceiling-proposal-bundles-every-bad-policy-idea-into-one-noxious-package">He fended off their efforts</a> to torpedo the support for renewable energy in last year's Inflation Reduction Act, their harshest proposed budget cuts, the rollback of student debt relief, and repeal of his budget increase for the Internal Revenue Service. </p><p>(Reports say that $10 billion will be shaved off the $80-billion 10-year IRS budget increase, but the money can be redirected to other programs.)</p><p>Biden rejected Republican demands to impose work requirements on Medicaid, but allowed some tightening of the rules for food stamps  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which is what's left of traditional welfare.</p> Column: Here's why the debt ceiling is not only stupid  it's unconstitutional<p>Make no mistake: No rich American will be harmed even a bit by this deal. Some may even be advantaged, if the carve-out from the IRS budget comes from the agency's enforcement efforts; that would help the rich, who are the nation's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-03-23/super-rich-tax-evasion">worst tax cheats</a>. </p><p>The most vulnerable Americans, however, will bear the brunt of the deal points. Let's take a look.</p><p>Start with work requirements. As I've reported </p>ad infinitum<p> over the years, work requirements on safety net programs accomplish nothing in terms of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-14/hiltzik-medicaid-work-requirements-cost">pushing their beneficiaries into the job market</a>. </p><p>They are, however, very effective at throwing people off those programs; that's what happened in Arkansas , where <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-medicaid-work-20190621-story.html">17,000 people lost Medicaid benefits</a> in 2019 after only six months of a limited rollout of work rules. A federal judge then blocked the changes. </p><p>The debt ceiling deal will tighten work requirements for SNAP by requiring able-bodied, childless low-income adults younger than 55 to work 20 hours a week or be engaged in job training or job searches. If they don't meet that standard, their SNAP benefits end after three months. Current law applies to those adults only up to the age of 49. The change will expire in 2030.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/d0/c3/7508f3fe4afeb239c1442923f5a6/census-work-rules.jpg"></figure><p>This rule will do virtually nothing to reduce federal spending, which Republicans say has been the whole point of holding the debt ceiling hostage. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in April that the change would <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-04/59102-Arrington-Letter_LSG%20Act_4-25-2023.pdf" target="_blank">reduce federal spending by $11 billion over 10 years</a>, or $1.1 billion a year.</p><p>By my calculation, that comes to 17 thousandths of a percent of the federal budget, which this year is $6.4 trillion. </p><p>If it's scarcely a rounding error in federal accounts, however, it's critically important to the recipients of food aid. The CBO estimated that about 275,000 people would lose benefits each month because they failed to meet the requirement. </p><p>Biden's negotiators did get the Republicans to waive SNAP rules for veterans and the homeless, which will probably lower that figure and limit the reduction of federal spending.</p><p>Work requirements for safety net programs have been a Republican hobby horse for decades. It's based on the Republican image of low-income Americans as layabouts and grifters  the "undeserving poor." </p><p>Sure enough, Rep. Garret Graves (R-L</p>ouisian<p>a.), one of McCarthy's debt-ceiling negotiators, couldn't resist <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/mccarthy-debt-limit-negotiator-work-requirements" target="_blank">slandering this vulnerable population</a> during the talks. "Democrats right now are willing to default on the debt so they can continue making welfare payments for people that are refusing to work," he said during a break.</p><p>Of course, it was Republicans who showed willingness to default on the federal debt. Nor is there a smidgen of evidence that any sizable percentage of this target population </p>are  is<p> "refusing to work."</p> Column: The GOP's debt ceiling proposal bundles every bad policy idea into one noxious package<p>The vast majority of SNAP recipients already work, but they're in low-paying jobs that are so unstable that they often drift in and out of employment. <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/07/most-families-that-received-snap-benefits-in-2018-had-at-least-one-person-working.html" target="_blank">According to the Census Bureau</a>, 79% of all SNAP families include at least one worker, as do nearly 84% of married couples on SNAP. </p><p>In other words, the GOP insistence on work requirements is nothing but the party's typical performative malevolence toward the poor. If they really cared about getting SNAP recipients into the job market, they'd fund job training programs and infrastructure projects. They never do. </p><p>In any case, the only cohort of beneficiaries that tends to move into the job market at all are younger recipients  not those in their </p>fifties 50s<p>. All that work requirements accomplish is to erect bureaucratic barriers to enrollment in the safety net. But that's the point, isn't it?</p><p>The work rules for TANF are managed somewhat differently  they're directed at the states administering the program, which have been required to ensure that a certain percentage of beneficiaries are working or looking for work. How the debt ceiling deal applies to that program is unclear.</p><p>In the next week </p>of<p> or so, before June 5  the putative date at which the Treasury Department says the government runs out of money to pay its bills without a debt ceiling increase and thus flirts with an unprecedented default  Biden and McCarthy will hit the hustings to claim victory. </p><p>But there's really only one way to think about the exercise we've just gone through. It was a supreme waste of time. </p><p>Republicans showed they were willing to crash the U.S. economy to make some bog-standard complaints about the federal deficit, most of which they created themselves through the 2017 tax cuts they <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-tax-cut-effects-20190529-story.html">enacted for the wealthy</a>. Their initial negotiating stance was so extreme that they must have known it could never gain Democratic votes in the House or pass the Democratic Senate.</p><p>The Democrats held reasonably firm. They agreed to some modest budget constraints for two years, moved the next debt ceiling cabaret off to beyond the next election, and saved millions of Americans from serious economic pain. </p><p>As I've written before, if Republicans were really serious about restraining federal spending, they wouldn't have voted for the tax cuts and budget increases that that contribute to the deficit. </p><p>Instead, they said the only way to control spending is to refuse to pay the bills they ran up, by refusing to increase the debt ceiling. They lied, and every thinking American knows they lied. So tell me, why did we go through this again?</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He takes pride in knowing how to maximize his earnings on each trip he takes. That means knowing the right times to drive, which rides to accept and which to pass up  and it also means knowing the letter of the law that governs his trade. </p> In particular, i<p>t means knowing <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2020-11-04/prop-22-passed-what-happens-next">Proposition 22,</a> the controversial ballot </p> measure proposition <p>that passed in 2020 and became law in 2021, inside and out.</p> For the gig drivers of California, Gomez's eagle-eyed attention to detail, paired with a fellow driver's fighting spirit, resulted in a windfall that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars means windfall checks adding up to tens of millions of dollars. <p>Proposition 22, you might recall, overrode </p> part of<p> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-10/california-ab5-independent-contractors-employees-newspapers">AB 5</a>, a law that classified gig </p>app <p>workers as employees, entitling them to benefits and protections. </p>Proposition 22  The ballot measure <p>instead <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-11-03/2020-california-election-tracking-prop-22">enshrinedcarved out app-based gig workers as independent contractors</a></p>,<p> and put in place a raft of better-than-nothing half measures: Instead of full healthcare coverage, gig workers got a healthcare subsidy, if they worked enough hours to qualify. Instead of a minimum wage, drivers got a minimum earnings guarantee  but only for engaged miles, not time spent between rides.</p><p>Its a long and confusing law, but Gomez studied it when it passed</p>,<p> and took note of one of its more arcane benefits: a </p> provisionstatute <p>that grants drivers making the bare minimum a small </p> reimbursement compensation <p>for vehicle expenses. Starting in 2021, gig app companies were to pay drivers 30 cents per mile driven on the job. But Proposition 22 also stipulates that every year, that rate will be raised to keep pace with inflation. Since inflation was 6.8% in 2022, that </p> fee comp <p>was supposed to be bumped up 2 cents. In 2023, </p> it should have gone <p>up 2 more, to 34 cents </p>per  a<p> mile.</p><p>This is where it gets interesting. As far as </p> Gomez<p> could tell, </p> no such increase ever took effectthat rate had never been raised<p>. </p> As of early this year, d<p>rivers were still being paid 30 cents </p>per  a<p> mile.</p><p>Now, 2 to 4 cents a mile might not sound like much, but to gig workers driving hundreds of miles a day, it adds up fast. In the course of a year, those pennies can add up to hundreds, even thousands of dollars. </p> Multiplied Spread <p>across the nearly </p>1.5one and a half  1.3<p> million gig app drivers in California, it can add up to tens, even hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>So. This past In <p>March, Gomez was having dinner with a colleague, Sergio Avedian. Theyd texted and corresponded a lot, but never met in person. Avedian is a longtime Uber driver too, and in recent years, hes turned to advocacy as well. Hes a senior contributor at <a href="https://therideshareguy.com/" target="_blank">the Rideshare Guy,</a> where he runs a podcast that tackles the ins and outs of ride-hail policy and gig working life. Ive highlighted some of his work <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-04-11/algorithmic-wage-discrimination">in this column before.</a></p> Column: Uber and Lyft's 'deactivation' policy is dehumanizing and unfair. It must end Avedian is <p>a force. He keeps an Excel spreadsheet </p>of  documenting<p> every one of the thousands of rides he </p> providesmakes <p>each year, logging his fare, miles traveled, pay and so on. He gathers data from other drivers, many of whom now listen to his show. He likes driving for the ride-hailing companies, but he is hellbent on keeping them honest. </p><p>During his meal with </p> Gomez<p>, </p> Avedian <p>started getting calls from reporters to comment on some news  Proposition 22, which had been struck down by a Superior Court in Alameda </p> County <p>in 2021, had been upheld on appeal. All the commotion reminded </p> Gomezof the matter <p>of the weird</p> ness with the <p>vehicle expenses rate. He mentioned it to Avedian. Sergio immediately started doing math in his head</p> , Gomez recalls. W<p>hen they pored <a href="https://vig.cdn.sos.ca.gov/2020/general/pdf/topl-prop22.pdf">over the law,</a> they realized that Proposition 22 had technically saddled the California treasurers office with the task of calculating and publishing the </p>adjustment <p>adjusted rate each year, which, as far as they could tell, it had not done.</p><p>For 18 months nothing was done, </p> AvedianSergio <p>said. I missed 18 months! Everybody missed 18 months! I was like, Holy s, this could be a lot of money! </p> Column: If you work for Uber or Amazon, you may be a victim of algorithmic wage discrimination<p>There are some 1.3 million gig workers in California, according to industry reports, </p> includingand<p> over <a href="https://medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/analysis-on-impacts-of-driver-reclassification-2f2639a7f902">209,000 Uber drivers</a> and <a href="https://doordash.news/dasher/dashers-are-earning-more-money-and-working-flexibly-under-californias-prop-22/">200,000 DoorDash drivers.</a></p> alone<p> "Im telling you, its going to be like $100 to $300 million</p>dollars<p>," Avedian said</p> , offering some back-of-the-envelope math to support his estimate<p>.</p><p>On April 13, </p> Gomez <p>called the state treasurers office and asked about the rate adjustment. </p> The first person he reached directed him to the IRS' webpage for information on mileage-based tax deductions. After explaining what he was after and spending some time on hold, Gomez<p> was assured the rate would be published soon.</p><p>Weeks went by. After conferring with </p> Avedian <p>again, </p> Gomez <p>tweeted at Fiona Ma, the California treasurer, asking why the rate hadnt been changed yet.</p> Avedian <p>boosted the tweet too, and, a week later, on May 10, Ma replied, announcing that the rate adjustment <a href="https://www.treasurer.ca.gov/prop-22.asp">had been published.</a> Almost immediately, perhaps fearing the prospect of a class-action lawsuit, Uber and DoorDash began sending the back pay to drivers. </p> Avedian<p>, who drives only part</p>-<p> time and picks only profitable rides, got $85 from Uber;</p>, and<p> his wife, who drives part</p>-<p> time too, got more than $200 from DoorDash.</p> Remember, drivers get paid only if theyre making the minimum rate, and many ride-hail drivers exceed it. Bu<p>t theres one kind of driver who tends to make the minimum, as they rely on tips for income  delivery drivers.</p><p>Delivery is horrible for base pay, </p> Avedian <p>says. If you are a full-time Uber Eats or Grubhub driver youre getting over a thousand dollars [in mileage reimbursement], guaranteed.</p><p>All said, the catch-up payments stand</p>s <p> to be a huge boon to gig workers and delivery drivers </p>throughout the  state wideeverywhere<p>.</p>right?<p> Uber, </p> whose business spans ride hailing and food delivery,<p> wont say how much its paid out, </p>for example, <p>but the anecdata suggest its </p>a lot<p>. (As of </p> this<p> writing, Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have begun issuing back pay; Instacart and Grubhub have not. Since the payout applies to all companies that work with independent contractors, it applies to Amazon Flex, Target's Shipt and Walmart's Spark as well, though those companies tend to pay above the minimum.)</p>It also raises the question  So,<p> what happened? Why werent drivers getting the full rate all along? Consumers are paying</p> <p>for it, after all. As </p> Avedian Sergio <p>points out, every time you take a Lyft or order Uber Eats, youre paying an extra 75 cents to </p>a dollar  $1<p> for a fee marked California Driver Benefits, which is then ostensibly used to pay for things </p>like  such as<p> health subsidies and this mileage fee. </p> The resulting pile of money is oneIfwhy is this an if? we said in the lede it is tens of millions, do we know to a reasonable certainty or not? - yeah i mean there are no HARD figures but math suggests at least that as detailed above  this vehicle earnings adjustment does add up to tens of millions of dollars, that means<p> the app companies got to sit on</p> a huge sum<p> for a year and a half, earning interest or investing it or using it to cover losses or so on.</p> Column: Will self-driving cars make L.A.'s world-famous traffic even worse?<p>This is where it gets murky. </p> When <p>I asked Uber why it didnt pay drivers the adjusted rate as Proposition 22 requires it to do</p> , t<p>he company </p>it<p> blamed the treasurer's office for not publishing the adjusted rate.</p><p>As outlined in the proposition, the California Treasurer's office is required to update per-mile compensation for vehicle expenses based on inflation, Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab told me in an email. That office released those updates last week, both for 2022  18 months late  and for 2023. We are in the process of making all necessary adjustments to ensure the benefits afforded to drivers by Prop</p> .<p> 22 will continue to be met.</p><p>The state treasurers office, meanwhile, hit back.</p><p>The characterization that the treasurers office was somehow late posting the adjustment is misinformed and disingenuous, Joe DeAnda, </p>the communications director  a spokesman<p> for the treasurers office, said in a statement.</p><p>Proposition 22 was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-08-20/prop-22-unconstitutional">struck down as unconstitutional in August 2021,</a> he said</p>says<p>, so the office deemed the law unenforceable. Given the uncertainty of the laws status, he </p>added  said<p>, and the ongoing legal activity, the State Treasurers Office refrained from publishing the adjusted rate, and only felt it prudent to do so when the law formally took effect this March.</p>Moving forward, <p>DeAnda </p> saidsays,<p> adjustments will be calculated and published every January.</p><p>Now, one reason that the </p>state <p>treasurers office might be defensive about the timeline here is that </p>California State Treasurer Fiona <p>Ma is running for lieutenant governor in the next election cycle.</p><p>She provided a statement on the matter</p>,<p> too:</p><p>More money going in the pockets of drivers is a good thing, she said. App-based delivery services have become a major source of economic activity for California, and the provision that requires the State Treasurers Office to provide annual adjustments to the vehicle expense reimbursement rate is critically important since none of it would be possible without the drivers willingness to use their own vehicles to work. I encourage all drivers to check their accounts for these payments and hope all companies will quickly issue reimbursements if they havent already.</p><p>The treasurers office says it has already been flooded with calls from drivers looking for their payments. But it has no ability to pay them  that </p> duty <p>falls to the gig app companies themselves. The treasurers responsibility begins and ends with adjusting that rate (you can see it at the top of the treasurer's website now).</p><p>The treasurer has heard from some drivers that Uber is encouraging them to contact the treasurer's office, despite knowing it has no power to provide funds of any kind to them. (It also might be noted that </p>while  although<p> the law charges the </p>treasury  state <p>with calculating and publishing the rate, its not entirely clear that the gig app companies arent responsible for paying the adjusted rate even if the </p> statetreasury <p>doesnt do so.)</p><p>It is, in short, a big, stinking mess. And </p>while  although<p> Uber tries to throw the treasurer's office under the bus, and </p>the treasury that office claims  says<p> it couldnt make the adjustment on time due to legal uncertainty, guess who gets the short end of the stick? The gig workers who were barely making minimum wage to begin with.</p><p>And that, says Veena Dubal, a professor </p>of law <p>at the </p>University of California  UC Hastings College of the Law,at Hastings, <p>is the entire point. This was what the gig app companies that wrote Proposition 22 </p>into law in the first place<p> were trying to do  make a big, stinking mess that would be perennially hard to sort out.</p><p>It was specifically written to be confusing, Dubal tells me. To everyone. Voters, consumers, drivers, state actors.</p> Thats because, as Dubals scholarship has shown, gig app companies, which have never been profitable, depend on taking every conceivable opportunity to squeeze workers, engaging in practices such as  <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-04-11/algorithmic-wage-discrimination">algorithmic wage discrimination</a> and rampant corner-cutting.Remember how that treasurer rep tried to direct  Gomez Pablo to the IRS vehicle mileage deduction rate? That rate for 2023 is 65.5 cents per mile  nearly twice what the Proposition 22 rate is. But ride-share  app-based drivers are not eligible  for to earn that because theyre not business owners, who could deduct it, and theyre not employees, whose employers would cover it, either. They have to settle for the scraps that Proposition 22 tossed them, which gig app companies and the state cant even manage to dole out properly.<p>Again, this is by design.</p><p>I bet if you asked any given voter what Prop. 22 did, they would say, it benefits workers! Dubal says. In fact, it took rights away from workers and dramatically lowered the wages they were owed under the law. ... I can only imagine the companies hoped no one at the treasurys office would notice this strange new responsibility so they could nickel and dime drivers. </p><p>Those companies, </p> which <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-11-05/prop-22-californians-let-uber-and-lyft-buy-a-law">spent more than $200 million</a></p>  campaigning for Proposition 22,<p> didnt count on drivers like Gomez and </p> Avedian<p>, perhaps, to </p>pry  claw <p>back what was rightfully theirs.</p><p>Honestly, it feels great, </p> Gomez <p>says. I hope this brings a bright spotlight on a broken system that exploits workers and consumers alike.</p> Avedian<p>, for his part, is already moving on to the next challenge. He wants to take stock of what it is that the gig app companies are doing with all the money they get under the California Driver Benefits fee they slap on the millions of rides the app companies </p> facilitatemake <p>every day. Theres no public accounting of how that money gets used, and none required by the letter of the law. </p><p>And weve already seen what happens when no one forces the gig app companies to meet it: Nothing.</p>//some alternative wording for "meet it"?                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

How will it happen? Will it happen at all? These are the questions on so many minds in the age of OpenAI and Googles Bard, of the suddenly ubiquitous text and image generators </p> such as <p>ChatGPT and Midjourney.</p><p>The maddening thing is that, at least at first, its probably not going to look like much of anything. There will be no cybernetic android that lumbers over to your desk and takes over your work duties, no disembodied robot voice that suddenly assumes command over your department. It might just look like routine layoffs, or a freelancer having more trouble finding work.</p><p>A friend of mine, a veteran artist and prolific freelance illustrator, told me its been a really weak year, and </p> believes  <p>the rise of AI image generation is to blame. Hes spoken to art directors at ad agencies, where hes made much of his </p> past <p>income, who told him theyve begun using Midjourney internally; the work isnt published publicly, so there are fewer concerns about copyright and no working illustrators who might see the material and shame them.</p>That<p> is what it will look like to many as managers turn to AI to meet their needs to cut costs: not a fiery robot apocalypse, but a slowly declining rate of work on offer.</p><p>More maddening still, few are likely to agree on what constitutes technological replacement, and what does not.</p><p>Case in point: Since the text generators burst onto the scene late last year, a number of digital media companies have been experimenting with AI-generated content. CNET <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cnet-publishing-articles-by-ai">quietly started publishing AI-written stories</a> in November, and </p>Buzzfeed<p> BuzzFeed and Insider have announced that theyre trying out different forms of AI-generated content too.</p> Column: Your boss wants AI to replace you. The writers' strike shows how to fight back<p>At the same time, all three companies have also been experimenting with laying off their staff. CNET <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622231/cnet-layoffs-ai-articles-seo-red-ventures">fired 10% of its newsroom in March</a>, and Insider <a href="https://gizmodo.com/business-insider-layoffs-ai-chatgpt-tests-1850356792">followed suit in April</a>. </p>Buzzfeed<p> BuzzFeed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/business/buzzfeed-news-shut-down.html">shut down</a> its entire Pulitzer Prize-winning News division, which was home to around 60 journalists, and laid off 15% of employees companywide.</p><p>Now, digital media is a particularly punishing business  another former heavyweight, </p> Vice<p>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/15/1173260377/vice-media-bankruptcy" target="_blank">declared bankruptcy</a> just last week  and one thats no stranger to layoffs at any given time. Yet the timing struck many as alarming, especially at a moment when executives in other industries are explicitly stating their intent to use AI to take over jobs previously done by humans; <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/02/ibm-stock-artificial-intelligence-hiring">IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna</a>, for instance, estimated AI would replace around 8,000 of the firms jobs in coming years.</p><p>Not two weeks after the News division was shut down, BuzzFeed held its annual Investor Day, at which </p> Chief Executive <p>Jonah Peretti spoke about, among other things, the ways his company was embracing AI. BuzzFeed has always lived at the intersection of technology and creativity, he <a href="https://investors.buzzfeed.com/static-files/44b860f7-1724-449c-9cd7-0570ff9555f1">said at the event</a>. And recent developments in artificial intelligence represent an opportunity to take this convergence to the next level.</p><p>AI, he said, was making brand-new kinds of content possible and would soon replace the static content weve grown accustomed to reading on websites with new formats that are more gamified, more personalized and more interactive. </p><p>BuzzFeed, he continued, is using generative AI to establish the blueprint for AI-driven revenue growth across the company.  And with the developments with both creators and AI, we see the opportunity to build a content creation model that makes our creative team more efficient and sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs.</p><p>When I shared the observation that BuzzFeed seemed to be going all in on AI on the heels of laying off its News staff on Twitter, the reaction was, uh, strong.</p><p>Unrelentingly bleak, </p>the<p> MSNBC host <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1659034975293898752">Chris Hayes commented</a>. None of this has to happen, </p>the<p> writer <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyJongFast/status/1659155851246985220">Molly Jong-Fast tweeted</a>. Writing doesnt need to be automated.</p><p>Displeased for </p> a different reason<p> was Peretti, who sent me a direct message accusing me of completely misrepresenting what he said. But what started as a hostile exchange  </p> "totally irresponsible," he called my gloss on his speech <p> soon became something more productive, as Peretti explained his views on how BuzzFeed would be utilizing AI. Our conversation via DM offered a window into the thinking of an executive in a field that generative AI stands to </p>impact<p> affect.</p><p>In the future, AI will replace static content because content will become more personalized and dynamic, Peretti said. For example, youll be able to chat with an article to get related information or background on a story you might have missed earlier. This has nothing to do with replacing writers or having AI write articles.</p><p>Peretti said </p>that<p> he was not automating the production of news articles, or </p>replacing <p>writers with AI. I was talking about the industry as a whole when I described static content being replaced, he said, and my prediction is it will be replaced with formats like the BuzzFeed AI quizzes, i.e. human-created content with interactivity added with AI.</p> Column: Afraid of AI? The startups selling it want you to be<p>I pointed out that laying off the people whose jobs were to write articles, and then pointing to the companys embrace of AI is nonetheless to make the case to investors that said new technology will make up the difference. On Investor Day, Peretti said the use of AI sustainably expands our output without increasing fixed costs, after all.</p><p>What happened to News and AI are unrelated, he said, I shut down BuzzFeed News because it was losing millions of dollars, and I still supported it for years and years despite the losses.</p><p>He </p> went on<p>: Some investors might misunderstand what we are doing and think it is about automated output as you say. Ive never said that, and I think it is a big misunderstanding of how AI will ultimately be used in media. Think of AI as a new medium, not as a labor replacement. We wont be replacing BFN output; well be making totally different types of content. Well need creative people to make these new formats." </p><p>And herein lies the crux of the matter. I believe Peretti when he says hes not looking at this </p> as a way to replace<p> workers  even if I am absolutely convinced that hes trying to replace their </p>value<p>. But when automation unfolds in a historical context, its rarely a one-to-one affair. Its not </p> as though <p>theres going to be a staff writer who specializes in science news one day, and a bot that is trained to reproduce her output that will be deployed the next.</p>  In the world of news-gathering, anyway  workers like <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-voice-generators/">     voice-over artists  </a></p>  and <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/tech/artists-ai-images/index.html">     illustrators  </a></p>  have found their art vacuumed up and spat out by generative AI trained on their work, though the legality of such practices is still very much in question, and humans are still needed to edit the final output.<p>Automation is uneven and messy, and its far more likely to proceed the way were seeing unfold at BuzzFeed  previously there was a big expensive team of humans doing difficult and labor-intensive work, and now they are gone and there is a different content product altogether, one built by a combination of new technology and input from a more precarious worker. (In his Investor Day speech, Peretti also spoke of the growing importance of partnerships with independent content creators. The shift will allow BuzzFeed to produce more with a smaller headcount, while also leaning into new internet trends, as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/27/buzzfeed-news-jonah-perfetti-creator-economy">Axios reported</a>.)</p><p>When I asked if he would try to maintain the same output without the News desk, he didnt answer, and that certainly appears to be the plan.</p><p>The way he sees it, I think, is that News was simply no longer viable  it had never made money, and it was unlikely to in the future. Shuttering that department was one decision; embracing AI for a different part of his business was another. </p><p>But its hard to say whether Peretti would have been comfortable jettisoning News if there wasnt a buzzy technology to create new kinds of content to intrigue investors with. News may have not been profitable in a strict sense, but it lent the entire BuzzFeed operation credibility and prestige, and generated knock-on value that the rest of the enterprise benefited from. If generative AI hadnt exploded when it did, would BuzzFeed be able to jettison News? Maybe not!</p><p>Thats speculative, and Peretti insists otherwise. But AI is above all</p>,<p> an ambiguity generator. It allows those who hold the power to justify making all kinds of calls, in the name of embracing the future, improving efficiency and so on. And in this still very young AI-infested moment of ours, we cant be sure which way many of those calls will break.</p> Column: Uber and Lyft's 'deactivation' policy is dehumanizing and unfair. It must end<p>There are, however, plenty of worrying signs  studio executives <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2023-05-11/column-the-writers-strike-is-only-the-beginning-a-rebellion-against-ai-is-underway">refused to agree not to use AI that would displace writers</a>, in a sticking point in the ongoing writers strike, for one  and ample anecdata in the form of <a href="https://twitter.com/MarketingMax/status/1612827271886430208?lang=en">all those</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gregisenberg/status/1648677152005451777">Twitter threads</a> about workers getting the boot in favor of ChatGPT. But its still hard to know how, when and if AI will have a major impact on the jobs picture. Peretti says hes sympathetic to this.</p><p>So many journalists are losing their jobs and it is a real crisis, Peretti </p>says<p> said. People should be worried. And history has valuable lessons for sure. The irony is if our AI entertainment efforts had started sooner and performed better, I could have had enough surplus profit to continue underwriting losses at news like Id done for years previously.</p><p>In the end, were still getting more AI and fewer humans  even if the AI is not doing the humans job, exactly. AI will be used by executives and managers much this way, I think</p>;<p>: to help gin up investment in future-forward products that require less labor costs to make, to buffer layoffs or attrition in human departments, and to hire more part-time or project-based workers.</p><p>Theres no jobs apocalypse coming; theres just a series of managers making the calls they think will best benefit their bottom line, and serve their boards. Just like theyre supposed to  AI or no.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But even when she gets a few hours of overtime at the theme park, the single mother of four can barely afford the rent of her one-bedroom apartment in Panorama City.</p><p>On her salary, buying a home is out of the question.</p><p>Already, her monthly rent of $1,300 is "just too expensive at this point," Arceo said, with late fees of $40 to $50 compounding her financial plight. "I don't think I've ever been on time on my rent." </p><p>Arceo's situation is common in California, which is among the nation's leaders in renter-occupied housing</p> units<p>. In the Golden State, 45.5% of housing units were occupied by renters in 2020, a small increase from the 44% rate </p>of renters<p> in 2010, according to newly released data by the U.S. Census </p> Bureau<p>. </p><p>California was second only to New York, where 49.7% of the housing units are renter occupied. The District of Columbia was an outlier, at 61.7%. </p><p>Nationwide, the rate of renter-occupied housing units  36.9%  is at its highest point since 1970.</p><p> "The growth of renter-occupied units continues to outpace the growth of owner-occupied units," the Census Bureau said in a statement.</p><p>The states with the lowest renter rate  and therefore the highest owner-occupied rates  were West Virginia, at 27.4%, and Maine, at 28.9%.</p><p>Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California, said the new data were </p>was <p>"not shocking." California's high rate of renters can be attributed mostly to "the high cost of housing," Johnson said.</p><p>The annual income needed to buy a home in Los Angeles rose last year </p>to <p>beyond $220,000, according to a study by <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-01/you-need-earn-more-than-220000-year-buy-house-in-los-angeles">the residential real estate firm Redfin</a>. With higher mortgage interest rates and inflation cutting into household incomes, the ability to own a home is increasingly </p>beyond  out of<p> reach for </p>more <p>residents in Los Angeles, where the median annual household income in 2020 was just over $65,000.</p><p>High housing costs are also a factor in putting California near the bottom in another category: the rate of single-occupancy households.</p><p>New data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2020-census-demographic-profile-and-dhc.html">Census Bureau</a> show that more than a quarter of all households in America  27.6%  had just one occupant in 2020. The rate of solo occupancy is more than three times the recorded level in 1940, 7.7%.</p><p>A Times analysis found that California ranked 49th of the 50 states in the rate of single-occupant dwellings, with 23% of households occupied by just one person  a rate that has remained steady for about 20 years. Only Utah had a lower rate, at 20%.</p><p>North Dakota had the highest rate of single occupancy, 32.8%. The District of Columbia's rate was an astronomical 43.7%.</p><p>In states </p>outside  other than <p>California, "where rents are much lower or the opportunity to buy a house is better, it's not as difficult for a single worker" to live alone, Johnson said.</p><p>Another factor is California having a "larger immigrant population than in the rest of the U.S.," according to Johnson. "It is more common for immigrant families to live in multigenerational households," he said.</p><p>Utah has the lowest rate of single-occupant homes because the state has a high marriage rate and an uncommonly high number of children per household, Johnson said. He attributed those trends partially to Mormon residents, who make up well over half of the state's population.</p><p>The increase in people living alone coincides with higher social isolation, a worrying trend outlined by U.S. Surgeon Gen. Dr. Vivek Murthy in a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html">recent report</a>.</p><p>Our epidemic of loneliness and isolation has been an underappreciated public health crisis that has harmed individual and societal health. Our relationships are a source of healing and well-being hiding in plain sight  one that can help us live healthier, more fulfilled and more productive lives,&nbsp;Murthy said.</p><p>Such isolation increases the risk of premature death by more than 60% and includes higher risks of heart disease, stroke and dementia, according to the report.</p><p>To counter the increased isolation, "communities must design environments that promote connection," the report said, and "invest in institutions that bring people together."</p><p>While more Americans are living alone, Arceo, 32, worries about providing her children a home where they can enjoy some space for themselves.</p><p>With a 14-year-old son in the throes of adolescence and a 12-year-old son entering that stage, "they need their privacy," she said.</p><p>"It's insane to say that I work for this company and can't afford to give my kids a proper living," Arceo said.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/8e/4e/0c89fd614ee4a79b2e3a3b347c41/1304825-me-overcrowding-story-04-mjc-2.JPG"></figure><p>She has worked as a baker for the theme park for eight years, but Arceo notes that "I was homeless for the first year working at Universal," when she was forced to live with her then-three children in hotels, friends' homes, wherever they could.</p><p>With the bakery short-staffed, she has recently picked up "at least an hour of overtime a day," but it hasn't been enough, forcing her "to choose whether I pay my car insurance or my rent," she said.</p><p>Johnson, the demographer, pointed to possible hope on the horizon. He noted that California <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-25/california-census-data">has reported a steady decline in population</a> since 2020  starting at the beginning of the pandemic. The drop has coincided with the construction of more housing, primarily in the state's suburbs and exurbs.</p><p>"If California continues to lose people and build housing, at some point it should make a dent in the housing deficit."</p><p>A construction surge is not likely to make enough of a difference to change the conditions for low-wage workers like Arceo.</p><p>Looking to the future, she doesn't see many options. </p><p>"I can't afford to move," she said. </p>"The conditions of the apartment are not good at all," with mold from January's rains still not removed despite repeated complaints to her landlord.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But if you are willing to live somewhat like a troll, there might be something available for you in Alhambra. </p><p>Compass Real Estate recently put on the market a one-bedroom fixer-upper </p> onat 1340 <p>East Main Street that sits under a bridge, within walking distance of a Vietnamese restaurant and a hair salon. </p><p>Southern California's pricey housing market has forced many potential buyers to either settle into comfortable homes in far-flung suburbs or purchase postage stamp-size properties closer to the region's job centers. The recent <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-01/as-spring-buying-season-kicks-off-homes-for-sale-are-scarce">hikes in mortgage interest rates</a> have only aggravated the problem.</p><p>Another extreme option for potential buyers: Consider a quirky, one-of-a-kind property like Alhambra's bridge house. </p><p>The 450-square-foot apartment built in 1949 has a terrace that looks over a stream and a rooftop patio that sits next to a road bridge, separated only by a fence. It is priced at $250,000  a steal considering the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-25/southern-california-home-prices-have-been-falling-but-are-the-drops-over">median sale price</a> for an existing single-family house in Southern California is about $785,000.</p><p>"We had no comparables  no similar properties," said Doug Lee, the Compass agent who listed the home, which he said once belonged to a high school friend's parents. "This is a very, very unique property."</p><p>Lee said his friend's parents purchased the home in 2005 for about $72,000.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/cf/71/907a88374fd5b985c8d287115695/1340-east-main-street-02.jpg"></figure><p>Already, Lee has seen a flurry of interest in the home, which has been on the market for a few weeks. </p><p>He held open houses and showed the place to 40 or 50 groups each day, he said. </p><p>"This weekend we had it open and it was a zoo," he said. </p><p>The average one-bedroom home in the Alhambra neighborhood </p>will<p> costs </p>you<p> about $350,000, so </p>he <p>Lee decided to strategically price the </p>this <p>apartment at </p> just under <p>$250,000 to generate interest  and because there's no dedicated parking spot, Lee said. </p><p>"</p>Theres no dedicated parking. <p>It's a fixer-upper. We didn't know how responsive the market would be," he said. </p><p>The </p>apartment's <p>low price makes it one of only 11 properties in the county listed for under $250,000, Lee said. </p><p>There is one potential hiccup. While most homeowners own the land under their house, the bridge is presumably public land, Lee said. The real estate agents are working to clear up such property issues with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. </p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But access to life</p>-<p>saving cooling devices and the ability to cover the costs of electricity during a heat wave are often out of reach for low</p> -<p>income and elderly residents on a fixed income.</p><p>As part of the proposed study, the council asked staff to determine which buildings lack submeters, </p>a<p> device</p> s <p>that allow</p>s<p> utility companies to track power consumption on a unit-by-unit basis, and also the difference in costs between installing wall </p>AC  air conditioning<p> units </p>or <p>versus a central air system for an entire building.</p><p>Currently, air conditioners or central air are not required to ensure a rental unit is habitable in California, according to the state building standards code.</p> The lack of an air conditioner didn't bother Juliana Wingate when she and her husband moved into their apartment last year near MacArthur Park. Then in late August a record-breaking heat wave hit and Wingate felt miserable. "Our cat spent most of his time in our bathtub,  because it was so much cooler,"  Wingate said Wingate, who recalls feeling lightheaded and nauseated during the 10-day heat wave, when temperatures    topped   hit over 100 degrees. She 's hasn't thought about the lack of a cooling device this year, but now that it's getting warm again she's wondering if it would be better to just leave their second-story apartment. "Clearly, if that's not possible, I will bring it up with our landlord," Wingate said. It's unclear if that would mean her rent would go up, but she's not sure she could stick it out for another summer. "I love that every year just keeps getting hotter," Wingate said sarcastically.The state California <p>laid the ground</p> <p>work for an extreme heat action plan last year and earmarked $800 million to address the issue, but also saw a proposal to establish a chief heat officer fail in the state Assembly. A statewide <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-09/newsom-signs-bills-california-extreme-heat-warning-system">warning and ranking system</a> for extreme heat events is expected to launch by 2025, providing </p>some <p>general information to the public, much like the way other states respond to hurricanes. </p><p>But to advocates </p>on the ground<p>  </p>like  such as<p> housing policy coordinator Jovana Morales with </p>the <p>Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, a Central Valley</p>-based<p> advocacy group  it feels like the emphasis on addressing climate change and strengthening heat waves is often ignored until summer </p>time <p>rolls around and reminds everyone of the danger.</p><p>"I just don't feel like there is urgency in the Legislature," Morales said. "You know</p>,<p> ... we've been working on this, and people have been advocating for solutions, especially </p>like  ... <p>in the home, but it's just not happening fast enough."</p><p>Morales' group last year supported </p>proposed legislation,<p> <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB2597">Assembly Bill 2597,</a> which sought to update the state's building code to set a safe maximum indoor temperature in new and existing dwelling units. Units found without cooling options would be deemed substandard, according to the bill, which failed to become law.</p><p>The proposed code update was meant to address workers who live in substandard housing conditions, where temperatures often become so hot that </p>rental <p>units are unsafe to live in, Morales said.</p><p>But </p>the <p>Leadership Counsel was not focused solely on air conditioners. </p>They  It <p>pushed for improved insulation, increased shade through landscaping, heat pumps and roofs designed to reflect sunlight.

The actor has claimed that Jolie used legal means to skirt an obligation to get Pitts approval of the deal, and last June, the Stoli </p> vodka<p>-related Shefler and </p> Alexey Oliynik<p> were added as defendants to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-07/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-winery-lawsuit-miraval-oligarch">the revised lawsuit</a>.

Though the two became legally unmarried in 2019, their contentious divorce proceedings are ongoing separate </p>o<p>f</p> rom<p> the Miraval lawsuit.</p><p>In a</p>  second amended complaint<p> and an accompanying document</p>called "Answer"<p> filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, representatives for Pitt and his company</p> ,<p> Mondo Bongo</p> ,<p> allege that Jolie in 2019 agreed to either jointly sell the home and vineyard, which they planned to pass on to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-08-19/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-fbi-documents-2016-private-plane-incident">their six children</a>, or have Pitt buy out her stake in them.</p><p>Jolie, who</p>m<p> Pitt claims had a nominal 50-50 interest in the venture, had allegedly promised Pitt that she would "leave with what I put in and nothing additional," according to Pitt's court documents obtained Friday by The Times. However, recognizing Pitt's additional investments in the winery, Jolie agreed that "a 68-32 allocation of proceeds between Pitt and herself would be fair," his team said. </p><p>But those agreements were upended in the summer of 2021 amid <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-10-07/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-abuse-allegations-winery-lawsuit">the heated custody dispute</a> between the Oscar winners <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-20160920-snap-story.html">following their 2016 divorce</a>, as well as revelations stemming from a family altercation on a 2016 flight back from France that resulted in an FBI investigation. Pitt claims that Jolie reneged on the exclusive buyout negotiations they had agreed </p> on <p>in early 2021 when she originally said she wanted out. (Jolie has alleged that she agreed to sell her entire interest in Chateau Miraval to Pitt for $54.5 million</p>, which was at or below her cost basis<p>.)</p><p>"Jolie terminated those discussions and secretly purported to sell a 50 percent stake in the family home and family business to Tenute del Mondo," the documents said. Tenute del Mondo is part of the Russia-affiliated spirits conglomerate Stoli Group, which Shefler owns. </p>  'Illusion of inclusion': Diddy sues company behind his liquor brands for discrimination<p>Pitt and Mondo Bongo claim that they learned of Jolies putative sale to Stoli through a press release announcing that Stoli was "thrilled to have a position alongside Brad Pitt as curators" of Miraval ros, the documents said, alleging that the move was made "by design" and </p> that<p> Jolie collaborated in secret with Shefler to carry out the purported sale.</p><p>The "Once Upon a Time ... </p>I i<p>n Hollywood" star and Mondo Bongo accuse co-defendant Stoli of attempting a hostile takeover of the wine business and destabilizing Miraval's operations. The plaintiffs claim Stoli did so by seeking access to Miravals confidential and proprietary information "for the benefit of Sheflers competing enterprise, and trying to tear apart the winemaking partnership between the Pitt and Perrin families that is at the heart of Miraval and key to its success," the second amended complaint said. </p> PittHe<p> also complained that he could no longer enjoy his private residence</p> ,<p> as it was now co-owned by strangers.</p><p>Additionally, Pitt is claiming that Jolie made the putative sale "in the wake of the adverse custody ruling" in their protracted divorce proceedings that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-custody-20161105-story.html">favorably and temporarily awarded joint custody of their children to Pitt</a>.</p><p>In </p>an <p>answer to Jolie's cross-complaint, Pitt's team and Mondo Bongo on Thursday denied every allegation the "Girl, Interrupted" Oscar winner made in her cross-complaint and further denied that Jolie "is entitled to any relief whatsoever."</p><p>"Jolies actions were unlawful, severely and intentionally damaging Pitt and unjustly enriching herself," his team alleges.</p><p>Pitt is asking that the sale be undone and that he be awarded punitive and compensatory damages to be determined at a jury trial, as well as the repayment of his legal fees. Efforts to settle the lawsuit have been unsuccessful, The Times has learned.</p> Brad Pitt invokes Ukraine in revised Chateau Miraval lawsuit against Angelina Jolie<p>Jolie's legal team has argued that Pitt has no basis to sue her because they never codified an agreement to only sell to one another. Additionally, in her cross-complaint, Jolie said that she was growing uncomfortable in participating in an alcohol-related business given <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-brad-pitt-divorce-angelina-jolie-gq-20170503-story.html">Pitt's "acknowledged problem of alcohol abuse."</a> She also said she had substantial assets tied up in Miraval that she wanted freed up following their split. </p><p>The "Maleficent" star alleged that she offered to sell her interest in Chateau Miraval to Pitt, but </p> said<p> in exchange for his purchase, the actor demanded she sign a nondisclosure agreement that would have contractually prohibited her from speaking outside of court about Pitts physical and emotional abuse of her and their children. (This</p>,<p> after a sealed document </p>was<p> filed in their custody case was presented as proof of his alleged domestic violence.)</p><p>"Jolie refused to agree to such a provision, and Pitt walked away from the deal," the cross-</p>the <p>complaint said, equating the "distressing and coercive to the point of being abusive" provision as an attempt to silence her in the wake of "these traumatic events" on the airplane.</p> Dave Burd and GaTa break down that insane, star-studded season finale of 'Dave'<p>"No matter how many times Mr. Pitt amends his complaint, he cannot escape from the fact that he verbally and physically assaulted Ms. Jolie and their children  even choking one of the children and striking another," Jolie's attorney Paul Murphy said Friday in a statement to The Times.</p><p>"Still today and in the seven years since that fateful plane ride, he personally has never publicly denied that it happened. The reality is that Pitt refused to complete the Miraval sale with Jolie unless she agreed to being silenced about the abuse," Murphy added. </p><p>Jolie's cross-complaint also reiterated essentially the same <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-08-19/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-fbi-documents-2016-private-plane-incident">allegations of domestic abuse that were revealed in August 2022</a> after Jolie filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FBI, which investigated the in-flight altercation. Her cross-complaint alleged that the FBI agent who conducted the investigation "concluded that the government had probable cause to charge Pitt with a federal crime for his conduct that day." </p><p>Pitt was never charged in connection with the incident, either by the U.S. attorneys office or the L.A. County Department of Child</p> ren<p> and Family Services, which investigated the incident  and its allegation of child abuse  before the FBI got involved. The FBI decided in November 2016 to close its probe <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fbi-pitt-20161122-story.html">without filing any charges</a> against him.</p>Times staff writer Christie D'Zurilla contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

and angry staff stunned by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-06-07/los-angeles-times-newsroom-layoffs-merida-soon-shiong">announcement of 73 layoffs</a>, Los Angeles Times Executive Editor Kevin Merida on Thursday accepted responsibility for making really difficult decisions that led to dramatic cuts to the newsroom. </p><p>The organization is </p> cutting<p> photojournalists, longtime copy editors, news desk editors who help oversee the papers digital report and audience engagement editors. Audio producers were let go, as were a library researcher and several respected managers, including two stalwarts in the Spanish-language Times en Espaol digital news operation.</p><p>Its terrible. I feel awful about it but when youre a leader you have moments like this, Merida told more than 550 members of the papers staff during a Zoom meeting. Well be losing a lot of very valuable people and that's just really hard to take. Its hard for me, too.</p><p>The cuts represent the first significant belt-tightening since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-patrick-soon-shiong-latimes-sold-20180616-story.html">Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and his wife, Michele, paid $500 million to rescue The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune</a> from Chicago-based Tribune Publishing five years ago. Since then, the Soon-Shiong family has invested tens of millions of dollars in</p>to<p> The Times to bolster its journalism and cover revenue shortfalls that have continued each year during their stewardship.</p><p>The Times was making strides toward its profitability goals until COVID-19 pandemic closures in 2020 decimated advertising.</p> Executives initially announced 74 layoffs, but the number was reduced by one on Thursday after a team leader volunteered to go.&nbsp; The Times' contraction This weeks job cuts<p> unfolded against a broader backdrop of a newspaper industry in an existential crisis</p>, prompting that has prompted<p> dozens of newspapers to fold. Newspapers are starving for advertising revenue, which is being raked in by internet giants, including Google, Facebook and TikTok.</p>While  Although<p> The Times doesnt make its finances public, Merida acknowledged </p> that<p> the operation still relies heavily on revenue generated from its printed newspaper </p> at a time <p>of steady print subscriber declines.</p><p>And digital revenue has fallen well short of the levels needed to sustain the largest newsroom in the </p>western  Western<p> U.S.</p><p>Merida said The Times was facing a budget gap of tens of millions of dollars, which prompted the decision to cut dozens of staff members.</p><p>How can we figure out how to make our business self-sustaining, which is what we have to do, Merida said. Were dealing with structural problems in our industry and holes that cannot be easily filled.</p><p>The nearly two-hour session was </p> tenserough<p>.</p><p>Members of the newsroom union, Los Angeles Times Guild, already frustrated by the lack of progress in negotiating a new labor agreement to replace the one that expired in November, said they felt betrayed that management opted for layoffs before first offering buyouts to encourage staff members to voluntarily depart.</p>   "We've been evaluating the budget, in real time, since the beginning of the year, and trying to create savings, trying to do things to prevent what is happening now," Merida said. "It's on management to make that difficult decision. I want to own the toughness of that, and [not] put that on anybody else." <p>There was deep dismay that managers  who have been under fire for years over their </p> level of <p>commitment to newsroom diversity  had proposed cutting so many people of color.</p> The departures include d 34 white people and 39 people of color: 19 Latino people, 11 Asian American people,  4    four  Black people and  5    five  employees who identify as two or more races.<p>This is a setback for us, Merida acknowledged, noting that management was forced to follow the rules of the labor contract, which requires that layoffs be based on seniority.</p><p>Diversity is always important. We need to look at it in every context of our work Thats been a life</p>-<p>long commitment for me, throughout my entire journalism career, he said.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-05-03/kevin-merida-latimes-executive-editor-espn-undefeated">Merida joined The Times two years ago </a>after several years at ESPN, running the </p>the <p>award-winning division formerly known as The Undefeated that plumbed the intersection of race, culture and sports.</p><p>He spent more than two decades as a respected reporter then senior editor at the Washington Post, which he grew up reading as a youth in Maryland.</p><p>Staff members were upset about the number of Asian American and Latino employees who were let go. The papers only two Spanish-speaking photojournalists were initially&nbsp;included in the cuts, which would have left the photo department without a fluent Spanish speaker in a region that is more than 50% Latino. </p>   Late Thursday, after an unidentified manager volunteered to leave, one of the Spanish-speaking photographers was reinstated. <p>Reporters  viewed as the beating heart of the organization  were largely spared. So were the senior-most editors who make up the newspapers so-called masthead. Several reporters wondered why a few of the newsrooms top earners were not included.</p><p>No one from the masthead? asked investigative reporter Matt Hamilton. The masthead is the biggest </p> that<p> its been since I worked here.</p><p>During the meeting, reporters expressed frustration over Merida's responses to multiple questions, which they felt didn't go far enough&nbsp;or were evasive.&nbsp;</p> They demanded to know&nbsp; including why so many of the layoffs concentrated on audience engagement editors and web producers who work closely with reporters to build digital audiences for their stories.<p>"Kevin, you said in your letter that you want us to be a next-generation digital powerhouse," said Arit John, a national reporter based in Washington. "But how do we do that with ... no audio team, with </p> a<p> decimated audience team and a skeleton crew on the copy desk? These are critical roles."</p><p>Merida responded that not all copy editors</p>,<p> or news desk or audience team members were cut, and that there would still be people filling those roles.</p><p>The Times gave the 56 guild members 30-day notices. During the next two weeks, other staff members who were not on the list of layoffs can volunteer to take a buyout, which would spare a colleague on the list for the cuts. </p><p>But for more than a dozen non-guild members who received </p> termination  notices they had been terminated<p>, Wednesday was their last day.</p><p>Some speakers became emotional, including journalist Ameera Butt, who was part of the news desk team overseeing the website 24/7 and </p> handling <p>news alerts.</p>   She said that she was working an overnight shift last year in the days leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and made a speedy decision to publish a story to keep readers informed.     She said her team was integral to making the internet operation more vital to readers  . She said that she was the overnight news editor during Russias invasion of Ukraine, and said her team was integral to making the Internet  internet operation more vital to readers<p>.</p><p>I feel incredibly disappointed in management, Butt said. It's been awful. It's been blindsiding, it's been a shock because I personally love the L.A. Times and I loved working for you guys and ... thats gone.</p><p>Merida told her that he was sorry.</p><p>Sorry doesnt work in this situation, Butt said.</p> After the meeting, Merida acknowledged "it has been a difficult two days for our newsroom. I still love our place. Every day, I plan to come to work and do the best I can as a leader.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"They want to get that ad revenue as opposed to having to go to somebody else." If it goes through with the plan,  Amazon Prime  Video , known for shows including "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel," would join a long - list of streaming companies that offer ad-supported options to attract subscribers and retain existing customers.<p>Last year, Netflix launched a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-10-13/lat-et-ct-netflix-ad-supported-plan-streaming">cheaper plan with ads</a>, after years of being adverse to advertising on its platform.

The tech giant generated $9.5 billion in advertising services </p> during<p> the first quarter, up 21% from a year earlier. </p> Rob Enderle, a principal analyst at advisory services firm Enderle Group, called the potential ad-supported streaming tier an "additive revenue opportunity." "They're going after an audience that doesn't want to spend as much money for streaming and appears willing to watch ads," Ender ele said. "They want to get that ad revenue as opposed to having to go to somebody else."Ross Benes, a principal analyst with Insider Intelligence, said that in recent years Prime Video has "gotten more aggressive" about running promos prior for its other shows  ahead of its programming. ad-filled sports broadcasts. "Officially putting ads into Prime Video allows Amazon to centralize its audience and be more consistent with branding," Benes said. "It wouldnt be surprising if they eventually folded Freevee into Prime Video or shuttered it ... It has struggled to stand out in a crowded field of free services. Having one unified streaming service with various tiers would simplify Amazons streaming products for consumers and advertisers." <p>Additional revenue would help the company pay for its programming.

We will be saying goodbye to some tremendous colleagues.</p><p>L.A. Times Guild leader Reed Johnson called the layoffs announcement "outrageous and reckless," noting that 57 LAT Guild members, including several union leaders, were being </p>terminated  let go. He cited a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that he said requires the paper to offer buyouts to reduce the number of any layoffs.<p>"We were blindsided by this news," Johnson said. "Management did not consult us in advance about other options for cutting costs and saving money, short of layoffs. We have been bargaining a new contract since September, and this was never hinted at during bargaining.</p>"He added: <p>"The company must discuss alternatives to their unnecessary and short-sighted decision."</p> Times spokeswoman Hillary Manning rejected  disputed the union's characterization, saying the labor agreement gives management the discretion to proceed with layoff notices before offering voluntary buyouts. Affected Guild members, Manning said, were being given the required a  30-day notice, which the contract called for "in the event the Times determines it is necessary to make dismissals to reduce the force," according to the contract. <p>The restructuring represents the first significant belt tightening since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-patrick-soon-shiong-latimes-sold-20180616-story.html">Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong and his wife, Michele, acquired the paper five years</a> ago from Tribune Publishing, </p> which  company that <p>no longer exists </p> as a stand-alone company.<p> Since then, The Times newsroom has been largely protected from massive layoffs that have hobbled many other news outlets.</p><p>When the Soon-Shiong family purchased the paper, The Times was shedding print subscribers and </p>it<p> had just 125,000 digital subscribers. The family invested millions of dollars to help the organization recover from more than a decade of devastating cost-cutting, management missteps and a flight of journalistic talent</p>  while part of under Tribune. <p>Under Soon-Shiong, the newsroom added more than 150 journalists, rebuilt its business operations and launched an entertainment studio. The paper was making strong gains in revenue by early 2020. But the COVID-19 </p> health crisis pandemic<p> derailed the papers path to profitability as pandemic-related closures obliterated the papers advertising.</p><p>Since then, The Times has struggled to recover financially amid an industry</p>-<p>wide slowdown in advertising sales and subscriptions.</p><p>Executives declined to comment on the paper's financial losses. </p><p>The restructuring stems from the same persistent economic headwinds facing news media across the country, Merida wrote. Collectively, we have done a vast amount of work as a company to meet the budget and revenue challenges head on. But that work will need acceleration and we will need more radical transformation in the newsroom for us to become a self-sustaining enterprise. Our imperative is to become a modern media company  more nimble, more experimental, bolder with our ambition and creativity than we are today.</p><p>The Times has faced ongoing advertising declines, a problem that plagues most of </p> the<p> media.</p> <p>In addition,</p> <p>news publishers have suffered as social media giants, including Facebook and Twitter, have scaled back the promotion of news articles. </p><p>In recent months, growth has stalled in a once-promising area: digital subscriptions. The Times has nearly 550,000 digital subscribers, including through direct sales and third-party partnerships, </p> including    such as  <p>Apple News+.</p><p>The layoff</p> s  announcementmove<p> comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.latimes.com/about/pressreleases/story/2023-05-08/los-angeles-times-wins-pulitzers-for-breaking-news-and-feature-photography">The Times celebrated two Pulitzer Prizes</a>. The staff was honored for its coverage last fall of the Los Angeles City Hall scandal after a leaked audio recording revealed casual racist banter by three </p>then-Council  then-council<p> members. The Times also won for feature photography.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times is one of the greatest journalistic institutions in the country, and, frankly, in the world, Merida wrote. It sits without peer west of the Mississippi River. It is filled with phenomenal journalists  the prodigiously accomplished, the promising and the rising. And we are on the brink, Im convinced, of doing something extraordinary  transforming a 141-year-old newspaper into a truly next-generation digital powerhouse that serves the people of this city, and the world, in unparalleled ways.</p><p>Newsroom leaders were expected to notify the affected employees </p>on <p>Wednesday. Affected managers who are not part of The Times' union </p> NewsGuild <p>will depart immediately. Guild-covered journalists will stay on for </p>up to  as long as<p> 30 days, </p> as outlined in the guild agreement,<p> and receive 60 </p> days' worth<p> of compensation, </p> Manning said. Guild leaders said that after receiving word of the layoffs, they submitted the required 90-day notice to terminate the labor agreement that expired last  in  November. Both sides had been following terms of the contract negotiated in 2019.<p>In the last year, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, Vice Media </p> and<p> Insider have laid off journalists. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-04-20/buzzfeed-is-shutting-down-its-award-winning-news-division">Buzzfeed News and MTV News were shut down</a>.

"We take the trust that the public places in us seriously and will continue working hard, every day, to bring important issues to light, tell the great stories of our time and help our readers navigate their lives."</p> After the cuts, about 500 newsroom employees will remain, Manning said.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

CNN's prime-time ratings  already in decline  have dropped 30% since the network aired the Trump event, a clear signal that it angered the audience as well.</p><p>Licht expressed regret Monday to staffers about the Atlantic piece, by journalist Tim Alberta, in which Licht disparaged CNN coverage under his popular predecessor <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-cnn-jeff-zucker-20190528-story.html">Jeff Zucker</a>.

But the harsh assessments of its execution only escalated in the following days.</p><p>Veteran CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour publicly said she disagreed with the decision to present Trump in the format. When many CNN journalists supported her remarks on social media, it was a sign that Licht had lost the confidence of the newsroom.</p><p>With Licht already on shaky ground, </p> the Atlantic published Alberta's story<p> Friday under the headline<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/" target="_blank"> "Inside the Meltdown at CNN,"</a> which gave a detailed look at Licht's first year on the job.</p>Network management Licht<p> gave full cooperation for the story, and </p>its writer Tim <p>Alberta had extraordinary access during rehearsals for the town hall and preparation of the network's failed morning program, which was the first </p> programming <p>initiative under Licht's leadership. </p><p>The story reinforced the perception of many CNN insiders that Licht </p>was an isolated leader who <p>did not understand the culture of the operation and appeared too concerned with undoing the work of </p>predecessor Jeff <p>Zucker, who allowed more personality and opinion on the network.</p><p>The story, which included firsthand descriptions of Licht working out with his physical trainer, proved to be a major embarrassment for Licht, and insiders believed his departure would be imminent.</p> The drumbeats calling for Licht's ouster became louder in the last few days as top  name CNN talent, including Jake Tapper, Erin Burnett and Anderson Cooper, made their unhappiness    with   over the situation known to Zaslav, according to people familiar with the discussions.  It   The revolt by news anchors  was an indication that Licht would be unable to muster support from his troops. The communications team that signed off on the network's    participation   participating in the story followed Licht out the door.  Matt Dornic, who served as    CNN's  head of communications, and Kristine Coratti    Kelly , executive vice president and global head of  marketing communications,  also exited Wednesday, according to a person inside the network informed of their status. Licht came  into CNN with impressive credentials.  He helped create <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-04-01/msnbc-morning-joe-cable-news-expands-four-hours-joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-willie-geist">"Morning Joe," </a></p> the MSNBC program with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski that is a favorite of Beltway viewers. He launched "CBS This Morning," which had a five-year run of audience growth until its star co-host Charlie Rose was fired over alleged sexual misconduct. Licht was later assigned at CBS to oversee "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," which stumbled out of the gate when it launched in 2015. The program  helped by the emergence of Trump  turned    itself  around and became the most-watched late night comedy program under Licht's watch. But Licht's programming acumen was not on display at CNN. He never came up with a plan to shore up prime time, which lost viewers after the forced departure of one of its most popular hosts, Chris Cuomo. Licht chose to make a new morning show his first priority. The decision was baffling    to some.     T he time period has never been strong for CNN    because   most viewers    who are  not looking for political commentary in the morning    tend to  choose broadcast TV shows that incorporate local traffic and weather. Licht put together a team of Don Lemon, Poppy Harlow and relative newcomer Collins, who covered the White House for CNN   ,  as co-anchors for<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-10-29/can-a-new-morning-show-with-don-lemon-help-turn-around-cnns-fortunes"> "CNN This Morning." </a></p> The trio failed to jell gel, and Lemon, who does not thrive in ensemble settings, was fired after making sexist comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. The ratings have flagged for the program and only Harlow remains at the anchor desk. Collins is taking over the 9 p.m. hour in September.<p>Some insiders were dumbfounded when Licht's team wanted to have "CNN This Morning" re-air at 9 a.m. Eastern for West Coast viewers,</p>  which meant<p> the network would have been on tape at the start of the business day. It was one of the few ideas Licht was talked out of, according to one former CNN producer.</p><p>Licht was also forced to enact budget cuts and layoffs to help eas</p> ey<p> the financial pressure on debt-ridden Warner Bros. Discovery. But his choice to end the use of outside production companies for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-05-31/after-nine-years-at-cnn-journalist-lisa-ling-lands-at-cbs-news">CNN Originals</a>  which turned out high-rated programs that could draw audiences and ad revenues in repeats and on streaming platforms  was considered short</p>-<p>sighted.</p> Whoever takes the job of running CNN in the long term will have to help the business adapt to a smaller    market   universe of pay TV homes that is diminishing due to cord-cutting. CNN has a robust digital news operation, but the only way to watch its video channel live is with a pay TV subscription.  The company launched a direct-to-consumer streaming service, CNN+, which offered its own line -up of news and talk programming. But Warner Bros. Discovery executives were concerned    about  the cost of the startup and shut it down shortly after CNN became part of the new   ly  merged company. Licht's departure is likely to lead to speculation that Zucker, who was fired in Feb. 2022 after the parent company learned he had failed to disclose a personal relationship with his aide and chief marketing officer Allison Goullst. Zucker was a beloved leader within the company and led to CNN to record profitability over his tenure. Many people inside CNN see such a move as unlikely, Zaslav and Zucker - former colleagues at NBC - were once good friends. But the two men have had little communication since Zucker's departure, according to people who know them. Zucker, who now works at the investment firm Redbird Capital Partners, has remained in touch with many former CNN employees. The Atlantic profile reflected how Zucker's popularity among the troops loomed large over the organization Licht was attempting to remake. But Zaslav, who hand-picked Licht,has been vocal about the need to make changes at CNN. Turning to the leader who was ousted ahead of that transformation would be a massive reversal.Times staff writer Meg James contributed to this report.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

So had the emails. Weeks went by. </p><p>The story seemed over.</p><p>Then a message flashed on my computer screen.</p><p>"Its starting again  ," the May 11 email from Highland Park resident Alison Perrine said.</p><p>She didn't have to say more. </p><p>It had been nearly two months since residents in the Northeast L.A. neighborhood last received <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">unwanted food from Uber Eats</a>.</p><p>Her follow-up confirmed the return of an L.A. mystery: "Weve had 3 deliveries ... of a single order of McDonalds fries."</p><p>Starting in late February, bewildered </p> Highland Park <p>residents had been inundated with unsolicited orders ferried by drivers from Uber Eats. Now,<b> </b>I realized I'd be returning to Range View Avenue, the street<b> </b>at the center of the </p> whodunit<p>. </p><p>The first time around, errant meals piled up at front gates and on doorsteps amid a deluge that lasted a few weeks. Several people received more than 10 deliveries; one person got about 30, another about 40. Some residents were bemused, others annoyed. The unsolicited deliveries were in the names of other people, and mostly came from McDonald's and Starbucks. The food was paid for  and sometimes came with tips for the drivers, who, recipients said, mostly seemed undisturbed.</p><p>It was an odd (and rich) caloric tapestry. One order included four McDonalds McGriddles (two sausage, two chicken). Another consisted of a lone Starbucks iced matcha tea latte with a mocha drizzle. That concoction was far more complex than the beverages that most people received: kid-size cartons of milk and bottles of water  sometimes only one per order. It was these deliveries  the simplest of drinks in the smallest of quantities  that seemed to really weird people<b> </b>out.</p> A tasty L.A. mystery: Unwanted Uber Eats food deliveries vex Highland Park neighborhood<p>But residents said they hadn't received any additional unsolicited food in the weeks after The Times on May 15 published </p>an online<p> a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">story on their experience.</a> That is, until Perrine told me about the reemergence of the phenomenon.</p><p>Her note reignited the low-stakes </p> mystery<p>, which has highlighted the degree to which anonymity is woven into transactions carried out on the platforms of food delivery services, which have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-09-19/the-state-of-food-delivery">grown dramatically</a> since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The free fast-food dispatches have led the denizens of Range View to develop a host of theories that would explain the bizarre situation. Others have weighed in too, including residents in Westwood Hills, where a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">similar episode unfolded</a> in late January and early February.</p><p>People in that tony Westside community posited that the unwanted orders were the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">work of a burglary ring</a> that was casing houses by sending them food to see if anyone was home. No crime has been linked to the deliveries.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/46/6d/d7660bbf430b9e4eab6a819c40f7/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-09.jpg"></figure><p>As various hypotheses were cast aside  including one that speculated<b> </b>the orders were <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">part of an experiment</a> conducted by a college psychology class and another that suggested they were the work of scammers phishing for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">drivers' Uber Eats login credentials</a>  a leading theory emerged. It centers on the deliveries being the ploy of criminals who are testing stolen credit cards by making small charges with them via Uber Eats.</p><p>I planned to ask residents about that during a visit to the neighborhood on May 31. But first I placed an Uber Eats order. I parked on Range View under a sky lidded with clouds and </p> chose<p> a coffee and a juice from Starbucks  the sort of small, inexpensive selection that's typical of the undesired </p> deliveries<p>. My aim was to talk </p> to <p>the courier transporting the drinks. The Uber Eats app said her name was Wysper and I hoped for some answers  the sort that the company hadn't yet provided. </p><p>A spokeswoman for Uber, the San Francisco-based parent of Uber Eats, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-04-06/la-uber-eats-deliveries-mystery-driver-scam">previously told The Times</a> that the company was investigating the matter and had banned some accounts from the platform while taking other unspecified steps to prevent misuse of the service. The reports of unsolicited deliveries are concerning, the Uber spokeswoman said in an April statement. We ... will not hesitate to take additional action if the unsolicited orders continue.</p><p>Asked to comment for this story, an Uber spokesman replied with that statement from April. </p> He did not answer a handful of questions, including one inquiring about the source of the offending orders.<p>Perhaps Wysper would have some insight?</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/97/40/782a2fc641ea9da93b26a09ce9d8/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks-7.jpg"></figure><p>A few minutes later, a red Nissan Versa pulled up to the curb and a smiling woman stepped out of the car with a Starbucks bag. She explained her name was Wysper Samone. I launched into a spiel about the situation.</p><p>"Oh, wow," said Samone, offering what figures to be the only appropriate response when a </p> Starbucks run <p>unexpectedly turns into an interview.</p><p>Samone said she hadn't made other deliveries on Range View and wasn't aware of the strange orders in Highland Park. But she did say<b> </b>that something similar had happened near Pico Rivera. She seemed busy, so I wished her well.</p><p>I reached Samone the next day by telephone and asked if she had a theory that would explain the phenomenon. But she demurred.</p><p>"I just pick up </p> and<p> deliver," Samone said. "That's all."</p>'Low-tier' criminals?<p>There was one house I knew I had to visit. </p><p>Back in March, there'd been a sign on its front door that exhorted Uber Eats couriers to "NOT LEAVE ANY ORDERS!"</p><p>Richie Kulchar opened his door, saw my Starbucks </p> bag<p> and started to laugh. He thought I was a neighbor inquiring about the new deliveries. That would have made sense: Three residents on Range View told The Times that they had received multiple orders in recent days; two other people who lived nearby, Perrine included, said </p>that<p> they had gotten several deliveries in mid-May. </p><p>"Every day it's one milk in a bag," said Kulchar, a commercial producer and director who lives on Avenue 50 near Range View. "I'm a pro at this now, I'm checking my credit cards, my Uber Eats account  none of it is showing up on there."</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/df/dc/c880bd554e78a6657421116aaa9f/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-06.jpg"></figure><p>At first, Kulchar said, he was amused by the situation. But after </p> enduring<p> five </p> deliveries<p> from May 26 to May 30, he's not laughing.<b> </b>The orders are often brought by couriers who pound on his front door, upsetting his dog, Molly.</p><p>"Now, I'm just annoyed with Uber Eats," Kulchar said. "I throw it away, which is a bummer because I really don't like wasting an unopened milk. But what am I going to do, stock it in my fridge?"</p><p>Kulchar believes the </p> deliveries<p> are the byproduct of "low-tier" criminals attempting to validate stolen credit card numbers. Range View resident <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">Kelsey McManus agrees</a>. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/15/81/23c59dd04c20af2c655af32c0668/la-me-unwanted-uber-eats-delivery-01.jpg"></figure><p>She<b> </b>speculated that the effort could be AI-driven, noting that when some Uber Eats drivers have attempted to telephone the people who've placed the orders, the calls go to "nonexistent numbers." </p><p>We joked about using ChatGPT to solve the mystery. But when I queried the AI, it said that it couldn't "investigate specific incidents."</p><p>Asked if the unsolicited orders were part of an effort by criminals to test stolen credit card numbers, a spokesman for Uber said that it was a possibility the company was investigating. </p><p>Computer security and e-commerce expert </p>Dr.<p> Clifford Neuman wondered if the offending orders were placed by new Uber Eats accounts that were used just once, or whether they came from long-standing ones that made the purchases routinely. He also raised the issue of credit card charge-backs. </p><p>"You would think now </p> ... <p>months after this started, you would have gotten the charge-backs  which Uber would know about  when people saw it on their credit card statements," said Neuman, director of the USC Center for Computer Systems Security. </p><p>The Times asked Uber whether the unwanted orders have resulted in charge-backs and for information about the accounts making the purchases. </p> A spokesman said Uber could not share details of bad actors' methods and the company's response to them, because doing so would reveal internal processes to the offending parties.A 'boring-ass' prank?<p>A gnawing desire to "to know the answer</p>,<p>" has stuck with McManus.</p><p>"When you first tell people, they all go, 'Oh, it's a prank,'" </p>"<p> she said. "But it seems so much more systemic than that."</p><p>In an era of popular television shows built around elaborate reality-distorting ruses  among them Amazon Freevee's "Jury Duty" and HBO's "The Rehearsal"  the notion that the unwanted deliveries are part of a made-for-TV stunt has come up. But there's no evidence this is the case. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/92/ce/72a50b1b40debd4d1c3839a4fc00/1304122-me-0602-uber-eats-mystery-highland-park-cmh-08.jpg"></figure><p>Some residents think</p>,<p> maybe this is a prank of the more old-fashioned sort: one masterminded by college students.</p><p>Occidental College is<b> </b>just down the road from the affected portion of Range View, an eclectic stretch of about 25 houses and apartment buildings between Avenue 49 and Avenue 50. There is even a fraternity house on the block.</p><p>Wanting to ask the frat brothers if they had the inside scoop, I trudged up the front stairs of the house, snaking past a </p>front <p>yard teeming with overgrown weeds and discarded cans of Modelo Especial and Michelob Ultra. But no one was home  the </p>school<p> semester had ended. Another dead end.</p><p>Kulchar, in any case, doubted the theory.</p><p>"That's the most boring-ass prank that a college student could pull," he said.</p> Who's sending mystery Uber Eats orders to L.A. neighborhoods? The plot thickens<p>Walking past discarded ketchup packets that lined the stairs of the frat house, I was reminding of something </p> mentioned by <p>L.A.-based horror writer Lisa Morton, who called the whole episode a "cosmic comedy."</p><p>"Nothing really harmful is happening to these people, but it is beyond annoying and somewhat disturbing," said Morton, who contributed an unnerving short story to the 2021 anthology <a href="https://www.akashicbooks.com/catalog/speculative-los-angeles/" target="_blank">"Speculative Los Angeles,</a>" which offers largely bleak and futuristic visions of the city. "Maybe they have moved past it and accepted that it is going to be uncomfortable. Maybe that's how it is with these dystopian things we confront."</p><p>There was certainly something dystopian about the food waste generated by the ordeal. Some residents said they've eaten the free </p> fare<p> or donated it, but several others, Kulchar included, have been throwing it away. Morton gets it.</p><p>Food cloaked in mystery  mystery food, if you will  doesn't necessarily go down so easily. </p><p>"If I were getting this food, I'd be freaked out," she said. "I wouldn't eat it."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The explosions, which first occurred in 2009, have continued as recently as this year.</p><p>The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2016/INOT-EA16003-90730P.pdf">special order from NHTSA the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a></p> <p>asks multiple questions about whether ARC expects any of its inflators to blow apart in the future, and whether it has notified customers about the risk.</p><p>The agency wants ARC Automotive Inc., based in Knoxville, Tenn., to recall the inflators, which can blow apart a metal canister. But ARC is refusing, setting up a possible court fight.</p><p>ARC maintains that no safety defect exists, that NHTSAs demand is based on a hypothesis rather than technical conclusions and that the agency has no authority to order a parts manufacturer to carry out recalls.</p> U.S. urges recall of 67 million air bag parts after two deaths, injuries in California and elsewhere<p>NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the inflators are defective. The next steps are a final conclusion, public hearing and potential lawsuit asking a judge to order a recall.</p>Since <p>ARC inflators can be in both driver and passenger front air bags.</p>,<p> People who travel in at least 33 million U.S. vehicles could be at risk. </p><p>In the order, NHTSA asks ARC to explain whether it expects inflators to rupture due to something more than random one-off manufacturing problems. More than 1 million ARC inflators have already been recalled because of what the company describes as isolated trouble with manufacturing.</p><p>The order also instructs the company to estimate how many inflators will rupture while in use in the U.S. in the future, and it asks ARC why it changed its inflator manufacturing process in 2018 to install a scope that detects whether welding debris can block inflator vents. </p><p>NHTSA contends that byproducts from welding during manufacturing can clog a vent inside the inflator canister thats designed to let gas escape to fill air bags quickly in a crash. Pressure can build to the point where the canister is blown apart.</p> Driverless trucks on California highways? Legislators don't trust the DMV to ensure safety<p>Messages were left Thursday seeking comment from ARC. The company has to respond </p> to NHTSA<p> by June 14 or face a maximum fine of $131.6 million and potential criminal penalties. </p><p>Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group, said NHTSA is going back and connecting dots to counter what ARC asserted in its response to the recall request.</p><p>The agency, he said, seems to be trying to get ARC to say that it's possible other inflators can rupture in the future. They are simply looking for an admission from ARC that this can happen again, Brooks said.</p><p>The company, he said, would have a hard time arguing that no more problems will occur. I don't know that this is something that they can legitimately assert, that there's never going to be another inflator rupture, Brooks said. There's a high likelihood of another rupture of this type. There may not be a lot of them.</p><p>NHTSA also wants to know </p>why ARC added the scope to its manufacturing process in 2018, and it's demanding to know<p> which ARC employee approved the decision </p> to add the scope to the manufacturing process<p>. I think they're trying to get at what was ARC basing that decision on and does it suggest that there's a defect in the population of inflators that were produced before that date, Brooks said. </p><p>The agency said in its recall request letter sent to ARC in April that it's not aware of any inflators rupturing that were manufactured after the scope was installed.</p><p>Owners of vehicles made by at least a dozen automakers  Chevrolet, Buick, GMC, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Volkswagen, Audi, BMW, Porsche, Hyundai and Kia  are left to wonder anxiously whether their vehicles contain driver or front passenger inflators made by ARC. </p><p>Because ARC supplies inflators that are included in other manufacturers air bags, theres no easy way for vehicle owners to determine whether their inflators are made by ARC. Neither NHTSA nor ARC nor the automakers have released a full list of affected models.</p><p>One of the people who died after an inflator explosion was Marlene Beaudoin, a 40-year-old mother of 10 from Michigans Upper Peninsula who was struck by metal fragments when her 2015 Chevrolet Traverse SUV was involved in a minor crash in 2021. She and four of her sons had been on their way to get ice cream. The sons were not hurt.</p><p>In a response letter to NHTSA </p> in May,earlier this month, <p>ARC said no automaker has found a defect common to all 67 million inflators, and no root cause has been identified in the inflator ruptures.</p><p>The standoff with ARC has sent automakers struggling to find out just how many of their vehicles contain the inflators. Many say theyre still gathering information from later model years to determine which vehicles contain the affected inflators.</p><p>From 2017 to 2022, the ARC problems triggered seven small recalls from automakers. Earlier this month, General Motors announced the recall of nearly 1 million more.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Really, who thought the bZ4X, EQE or e:Ny1 was a good idea?</p><p>Beyond Prius, Tesla's S-X-Y: Electric cars branding is weird</p><p>The chance to name a new car is precious, a billion-dollar branding exercise with decades of potential staying power.</p><p>Of the almost 300 vehicle models in the U.S., roughly a quarter bear names that have been around for 20-plus years  even when the underlying car has changed. The Porsche 911 was introduced back in 1965, one year after Toyota unveiled its first Corolla. Making its debut in 1934, the Chevrolet Suburban is the oldest badge in the business.</p><p>Over the </p>past  last<p> few years, this rite has kicked into overdrive. </p><p>Carmakers are racing to electrify their product lines and launching new vehicles at a pace not seen in decades. Battery-powered driving offers a cleaner, quieter and eventually cheaper way to travel  an aspirational trifecta that branding squads must distill into a slew of catchy new car names.</p><p>Its not going great.</p> Column: Two Uber drivers read the fine print  and won millions for California gig workers<p>Take Toyota Motor Corp., the worlds largest carmaker. The company has been perfecting battery-powered vehicles since the late 1990s, and finally unveiled its first mass-market EV in 2022. </p><p>Its title? The bZ4X. </p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e8/f2/07cd90104a0489785b7e5b66ef2d/philadelphia-auto-show-21948.jpg"></figure><p>The bZ stands for beyond zero emissions; the 4 refers to its four-wheel drive and X denotes a crossover shape  all of which is probably lost on the Camry crowd.</p><p>Not to be outdone, Honda Motor Co. announced that its second EV will be known as the e:Ny1, a gamble on the appeal of a colon.</p><p>Over at Jaguar, a driver could be forgiven for assuming the carmakers electric option is the E-PACE, but that model has a gas engine. The battery-powered Jag is the I-PACE.</p><p>And no one could fault a Volkswagen fan for confusing the carmakers ID.4, an SUV-shaped EV, with the ID. Buzz, a recast of the companys famous van.</p> Driverless trucks on California highways? Legislators don't trust the DMV to ensure safety<p>Honestly, a lot of these names are just trying too hard, said David Placek, founder of Lexicon Branding, which helped name Lucid Group Inc., the Subaru Outback and the Honda Ridgeline. Everyone is kind of scrambling.</p><p>Placek said a great product name needs to check three boxes: It has to be memorable, noteworthy and distinctive within its category. </p><p>It also helps if the moniker is what we call processing fluent, Placek said. When the mind looks at it and says OK, I can get that.</p><p>Many new EV names fall short. They either hew too closely to tradition to feel noteworthy or stretch so far for distinction that they arent memorable.</p><p>No ones saying naming a car is easy, or that doing it poorly is unique to EVs (see: the Daihatsu Naked, the Ford Probe and the Studebaker Dictator). A cars name may also matter less to consumers than its price tag, range, features and aesthetic.</p><p>But as an exercise in marketing, the raft of clunky EV names represents a missed opportunity. </p> Elon Musk is dying to be funny. These eight comedians have some notes<p>Just look at Tesla: The company may have failed to spell out SEXY with its four models as planned  Model E was trademarked by Ford six years before Elon Musk launched his sedan  but the attempt was as memorable, noteworthy and distinct as it was juvenile.</p><p>In some cases, todays EV names also highlight a disconnect between R&amp;D and product planning. Nearly every automaker has set an ambitious timeline to completely switch to electric vehicles, but that memo may have been lost on the people naming the Kia EV6, for example, or the GMC Hummer EV. Those labels will age as well as the New York Football Giants.</p><p>Theyre just dating themselves, Placek said. Within five years almost everyone driving a new car will be in an EV or a hybrid.</p><p>There are also the names that metastasize, tacking on letters or becoming less clear as the variants proliferate.</p><p>Audi launched its seminal electric vehicle as the e-tron  sensible enough  but now it has a slew of e-trons, including the original and a (very different) e-tron GT. </p><p>Mercedes</p> -Benz<p> made a similar hash of it: The companys EV models include the EQS, EQA, EQB and EQE, as well as the EQS SUV, EQB SUV and EQE SUV. At the very top end, Mercedes also throws an AMG into the mix. No one wants to drive an alphabet salad.</p><p>Volvo spinoff Polestar Automotive Holding UK, meanwhile, took the iPhone approach: Its first car (no longer in production) was the 1. Now there's the 2, and 3 is coming soon. Polestar 12 is going to be bananas.</p><p>The best EV names arguably arent acronyms or jumbles of letters; theyre fresh and nouny and fun to say. </p><p>General Motors Co. took this route with its Chevrolet Bolt and Cadillac Lyric. Hyundais Ioniq clicks nicely. Lucid has its Air, Fisker its Ocean, and Subaru its Solterra.</p><p>Then theres Nissans Ariya, allegedly a tarting up of the Sanskrit word for noble or admirable. Porsches Taycan is a unique choice, but also conjures to mind an elusive jungle beast.</p><p>There will be more opportunities to improve upon the current crop of names: In the next year alone, well see 30 all-new EVs in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF estimates. </p><p>Until then, pour one out for the Toyota team who pitched Prius, which still has a nice snap 25 years on. They must have retired before Toyota's bZ4X came along.</p>Stock writes for Bloomberg.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

And the safety information on those self-driving passenger cars? It's spotty  in large part because the DMV and the vehicle industry</p> <p>are working to keep key safety data out of public view. </p><p>In 2021, after a public records filing by an unidentified individual, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-28/waymo-robot-taxi-sues-state-secret-black-ice">DMV invited Waymo</a> to seek a court injunction to prevent the agency from releasing full crash reports.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/19/37/6acd804a41bc87ee518510018fd7/waymo-dmv-blackout.jpg"></figure><p>After the injunction was granted, the DMV  with the legal assistance of California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta  cut a deal with Waymo to keep the information concealed on the grounds of protecting company trade secrets, according to court records. The deal, approved </p> in Sacramento County Superior Court,by the California Superior Court in Sacramento, <p>allows Waymo to redact most of the details of collision reports as well as information on how the company</p> <p>handle</p> s<p> driverless car emergencies, for at least two years.</p><p>Although those vehicles, thus far, have not killed or seriously injured anyone in the state,</p> <p>news reports show they can cause plenty of problems on the road: They</p> <p>tend to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/16/23512650/cruise-robotaxi-nhtsa-investigation-av-braking-traffic" target="_blank">brake suddenly</a>; <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/waymo-rush-hour-traffic-standstill-17739556.php" target="_blank">block traffic</a> as they pause to decide what to do; cruise through construction zones; and "brick" or stall in traffic, requiring a human on the scene to move the car.

At a committee hearing in March, she slammed the DMV "particularly in regard to one particular auto manufacturer and their overstated promise of what their vehicle actually is capable of doing." Friedman argued that Tesla's marketing claims are "leading to confusion from the drivers and purchasers of those vehicles and to lots of tragic accidents that could have been prevented with better oversight from the DMV and [federal] regulators."</p><p>The department allows the electric-car company to test driverless technology on California roads without a permit, while other companies are expected to conform to rules that require permits and trained test drivers. Tesla has said that </p> the feature it calls <p>Full Self-Driving is a technology that requires human attention, and doesn't require a permit, according to email records released under California's Public Records Act by the court transparency organization </p>Plainsite  PlainSite   . <p>Meanwhile, the DMV allows Tesla to market this technology package as Full Self-Driving. That name appears to violate the DMV's own rule</p> <p> now a state law  against marketing cars as autonomous when they aren't capable of fully driving themselves. The DMV said the matter is under investigation, but that investigation has dragged on </p> for<p> more than two years.</p> The DMV said it would investigate Tesla over self-driving claims. Then, crickets<p>"The lack of information after two years is deeply concerning," said Lena Gonzalez (D-Long Beach), who heads the state Senate's transportation committee.</p><p>When asked about the issue recently, Newsom said he had </p>"I have <p>"great confidence" in Gordon and his team. The governor said he's grateful for legislative oversight. But pressed on the specific criticisms aimed at the DMV, he said: "Forgive me for not being alarmed or shocked."</p>What is  and isn't  at stake<p>The driverless technology industry,</p> <p>centered in Silicon Valley, is opposed to AB 316. "The economic impact of this bill is going to be devastating," said Jeff Farrah, who heads the <a href="https://theavindustry.org/newsroom/press-releases/avia-statement-on-the-passage-of-ab-316" target="_blank">Autonomous Vehicle Industry Assn., </a>which represents Waymo, Cruise, Motional, </p>Aurora  Aurora Innovation<p> and other driverless car and truck technology companies. "California will cede its position as a leader in the development of autonomous vehicles to other states that are embracing this life</p>-<p>saving technology at a rapid pace."</p><p>Bill supporters regard such statements as alarmist hyperbole. </p><p>"It's easy for people to threaten to leave," said </p> Assemblywoman <p>Cecilia Aguiar-Curry (D-Winters), co-author of the bill, which is supported</p> <p>by the Teamsters </p>truck driver <p>union. "People aren't going to leave because of this," she said</p> , <p>noting the rich pool of technology talent clustered in Silicon Valley. Tesla, in fact, announced in February </p> that<p> it would move its Texas engineering team <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/watch-elon-musk-announces-tesla-engineering-headquarters-in-california/646E9BA2-5FB8-4C4D-A565-8EE4E926142A.html" target="_blank">back to California</a>, in part to attract and retain talented engineers.</p> The future of the $900-billion U.S. trucking industry could be decided in California<p>The industry notes that states including Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Florida already allow driverless trucks on public highways. AB 316 would slow down plans to deploy driverless trucks from Southern California seaports eastward across the country. </p><p>The bill would not block driverless truck deployment at the ports themselves or on private property. Asked whether the Port of Long Beach plans to allow testing anytime soon, Anthony Otto, chief executive of the port's container terminal, said no. "It's completely a safety issue," he said</p> .<p>Aguiar-Curry said for now she's happy to let companies test driverless trucks away from</p> <p>California</p> 's<p> highways, citing her constituents' safety concerns</p> .<p>She also </p>argues  contends<p> that the trucking industry's main concern is not safety but profit. </p><p>The business case for autonomous trucks is the vast reduction in labor costs when humans are no longer needed to do the driving. Replacing the estimated 350,000 truck drivers who work in California alone would lead to huge cost savings. </p><p>Notably, driverless truck companies are not yet profitable, and cash flow is a big issue. With rising interest rates, capital is harder to come by and the companies need to show progress to attract more investment before their cash runs out. One autonomous truck company, Embark, <a href="https://www.robotics247.com/article/embark_trucks_shuts_down_amidst_uncertainty_in_autonomous_trucking_market#:~:text=Embark%20Trucks%20is%20winding%20down,has%20already%20been%20let%20go.&amp;text=Embark%20Trucks%2C%20a%20robotics%20company,that%20it%20is%20shutting%20down." target="_blank">went bust </a>earlier this year.</p><p>Driverless truck companies are funneling millions of dollars into research and development</p> <p>and studies documenting their safety and reliability profile. A recent study from Waymo on collision avoidance suggests the reaction time is quicker for the AI driver than for human beings.</p><p>However, as it fights AB 316, the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Assn.</p> <p>continues to make debatable claims about safety. </p><p>Farrah has said:</p> <p>"Autonomous trucks are safer than trucks operated by humans." Former California Highway Patrol Officer Chris Childs, a paid consultant for the driverless vehicle industry group, recently told legislators that "in my opinion, autonomous technology is safer than a human driver." </p><p>Although no major crashes involving driverless trucks have been reported, data on whether AI drivers are safer than humans aren't yet able to settle the question. A paper published by the </p> research group<p> <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1478/RAND_RR1478.pdf" target="_blank">Rand Corp.</a> </p>research group<p> said vehicles may have to be driven hundreds of billions of miles to make the case.</p><p>No legislator is alleging that AI-driven cars are necessarily less safe than those driven by humans. They're saying no evidence has been presented, and the technology still has enough bugs to warrant more study, particularly before it's</p> <p>extended to big-rig trucks.</p><p>Just having an AI semi truck stop dead on a freeway for a period of time could cause major traffic problems, said Assemblymember Laurie Davies (R-Laguna Niguel): "If something happens on [some stretches of] the 5 Freeway, there's no way of getting around it. What do you do? How long does it actually take to move something like this?"</p><p>AB 316 would "give us the opportunity to find out what are the glitches when we're looking at large vehicles like this, and how we fix them so they don't happen again," Davies said. </p><p>For its part, the driverless trucking industry </p>argues  contends<p> that the Legislature lacks the expertise to adjudicate the issue correctly. </p><p>"The legislation puts the determination for very important safety and fact-based decisions in the hands of the Legislature instead of the able and experience</p> d<p> regulators at the DMV," said Mufaddal Ezzy, </p>Aurora  head of<p> government relations </p>head <p>for Aurora Innovation</p>, an autonomous vehicle startup<p>.</p><p>Waymo head of government relations Annabel Chang said via email: "If the legislature takes away decision-making power from these experts and creates a complicated political process to approve the operation of autonomous trucks, it will result in indefinitely delayed improvements to road safety and sustainability."</p><p>The experience level of the DMV regulators, however, is thin. The DMV official in charge of driverless car regulation, Miguel Acosta, ha</p> s<p> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguel-acosta-95935962/" target="_blank">no prior experience </a>in vehicle safety regulation or in motor vehicle technology. Before being named to his current job in 2018, he ran customer service for DMV vehicle registration and managed its field offices.</p>If AB 316 passes in the Assembly and then the state Senate,  the bill could go to Newsom for his signature later this summer.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

They blamed my credit report at Equifax. At first, Equifax could not even find my report. I had to send paperwork to verify that I even exist. It turned out that my credit file had some inaccuracies. One of the credit card companies restored the credit limit on one of my cards but kept the lower limit on the other card. I have filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and would appreciate any advice as I am confused and upset.</p><p><b>Answer: </b>Thats understandable, and youre not alone. Problems with credit bureaus topped the CFPBs list of <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_2022-consumer-response-annual-report_2023-03.pdf" target="_blank">consumer complaints in 2022.</a></p><p>You did all the right things: getting a copy of your credit report, disputing the errors, following up with the credit card companies and filing a complaint with the CFPB when your credit limits werent restored. The CFPB will reach out to companies to help facilitate a resolution.</p><p>If that doesnt work, consider contacting your local congressional representative. These lawmakers typically have constituent services staff that may be able to help.</p><p>You should check your credit reports at Experian and TransUnion in case the errors arent limited to a single bureau. If the inaccuracies stem from possible identity theft, consider freezing your credit reports at all three bureaus to make it harder for scam artists to open new accounts in your name.</p> Should your retirement savings plan include life insurance? Here are some pros and consStudent loan payoff and gift taxes<p><b>Dear Liz: </b>I adopted my granddaughter when she was 2. She has a number of student loans. Do I have the right to pay off her loans as her parent without tax consequences to her or to me?</p><p><b>Answer: </b>Paying off someones student loans would be considered a gift. You may have to file a gift tax return, but youre extremely unlikely to owe gift taxes.</p><p>The IRS requires you to file a gift tax return if you give any individual more than a certain amount in a year. (The 2023 annual exemption limit is $17,000.) You dont owe gift taxes until the amount you give away above this annual limit exceeds the lifetime limit (which is 2023 is $12.92 million). </p><p>Your relationship doesnt matter unless the recipient is your spouse. (You can give an unlimited amount to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen without gift tax consequences.)</p> Should you buy or rent if you plan to move within five years?Social Security and break-even math<p><b>Dear Liz: </b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-montalk-20170430-story.html">You recently wrote about </a>the complexity of retiring with a government pension and Social Security. You left out one very important resource: the Social Security Administration. Going into a Social Security office and sitting with a representative who can explain exactly how much </p> athis <p>person will get (almost impossible to determine <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/wep.html" target="_blank">online using formulas) </a>was the most helpful thing I did. I retired with a government pension at 60 years of age, and at 63 I went to the SS office to chat. I learned that if I waited until full retirement age (67) my break-even point would be 18 years! I slept on the numbers, discussed </p> that<p> with a trusted advisor and filed to take my Social Security benefit. Couldnt be happier. The employees in the local office were wonderful, knowledgeable about the windfall elimination provision and could give exact numbers.</p><p><b>Answer:</b> It sounds like the representative you consulted encouraged you to make your decision using a simple <a href="https://crr.bc.edu/field-work/social-security-the-break-even-debate/" target="_blank">break-even calculation. </a>Thats unfortunate for a number of reasons.</p><p>Break-even calculations typically purport to show the point at which the larger checks you get from delaying your Social Security application outweigh the smaller checks you pass up in the meantime. But the calculators usually dont include important factors, such as inflation, tax rates and the impact of your filing decision on survivor benefits. These calculators also dont include pertinent information about life expectancies. According to Social Security actuarial tables, for example, 63-year-old females in the U.S. can expect to live </p>another  an additional <p>21.24 years.</p><p>Thats average life expectancy, of course. The more educated you are and the more income you make, the more years you can probably add to that tally. And the longer you live, the more likely you are to run through your savings. Many people who are able to make ends meet in their 60s and 70s wind up struggling financially in their 80s because they started Social Security too soon, says actuary Steve Vernon, a former research scholar at the Stanford Center on Longevity.</p><p>Of course, youll be much less dependent on Social Security than most people, thanks to your pension. Its possible your trusted advisor took that into consideration, along with your longevity profile, tax situation and other possible income sources, when suggesting you apply for a permanently reduced check. Most people cant afford such reductions.</p>Liz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for <p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" target="_blank">NerdWallet.</a></p> Questions may be sent to her at 3940 Laurel Canyon, No. 238, Studio City, CA 91604, or by using the "Contact" form at <p><a href="https://asklizweston.com/" target="_blank">asklizweston.com.</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The 2021 study had a small sample size of 28 participants, but <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-cards-make-you-spend-more?utm_campaign=ct_prod&amp;utm_source=ap&amp;utm_medium=mpsyn">other research</a> also finds that people are likely to spend more with credit cards. </p><p>And failing to pay off your cards each month tacks on interest charges.</p><p>A vacation from credit card spending isnt for everyone, though. If you want to preserve your credit scores, youll still need to keep zero-balance credit cards open and active with small recurring purchases such as paying for streaming service subscriptions or other similar transactions. Issuers may close inactive accounts, which can cause credit scores to drop.</p><p>By not piling new purchases on your credit cards, you can make more progress on reducing debt or building savings. Here are some instances in which shifting your spending to cash or debit cards can make sense.</p>You frequently overspend in certain categories You might not need to go cold turkey on your credit card spending. <p>If you tend to overspend only in specific categories, consider setting aside a fixed amount of cash or funds on your debit card to cover those expenses. For those purchases that dont lead your budget astray, continue using a credit card and paying it off in full every month to avoid interest charges.</p><p>If, however, you usually overspend across multiple categories, using only cash may help you stay on track.</p>You're an emotional or impulsive spender<p>You may not be aware that youre an emotional or impulsive spender. However, its possible to get an idea by reviewing credit card statements and reflecting on the reasons behind the purchases, said LaQueshia Clemons, a financial therapist at Freedom Life Therapy and Wellness in Connecticut.</p><p>When you get upset or whenever youre emotional, this may be when you find yourself on Amazon or going to the mall, Clemons said. As a way to avoid negative feelings, you may find yourself buying items because this can give you a euphoric feeling to replace the negative emotions.</p><p>If you realize you might be in this category after reviewing your purchases, stop spending with credit cards and analyze your financial habits, she said.</p><p>You might also consider meeting with a financial therapist if its difficult to accomplish financial goals or youre in a continuous cycle of debt. The<a href="https://financialtherapyassociation.org/find-a-financial-therapist/" target="_blank"> Financial Therapy Assn.</a> has a directory to help you find a professional.</p>You can't see a way out of debt<p>If your credit cards are maxed out or youre struggling to keep up with minimum payments, its time to come up with a strategy to pay off the debt.</p><p>After several layoffs early in her career, Aileen Luib, a digital content creator based in California, said she had to rely on credit cards to get by. Her combined balances grew to $10,000 by 2015, putting a wrench in her plans, so she came up with a new one.</p><p>I was kind of tapping into my skill sets to start scraping up money in little corners of my life, and it all added up," Luib said.</p><p>She also used a balance transfer to consolidate debt from several credit cards onto one with a lower interest rate, and she didnt add new purchases to the card. With these tactics, she said, she paid off her balance in 2017.</p><p>Balance transfers typically require a good credit score of 690 or higher. The ideal balance transfer card will have an interest-free window long enough to pay off debt, no annual fee, and a balance transfer fee of 3% or lower. To determine if a transfer is worth it, consider whether the balance transfer fee costs less than what youre projected to pay in interest charges on the current credit card. (An online interest calculator can help.) Youll also make more progress on the debt if you stop putting new purchases on credit cards.</p><p>With less-than-ideal credit, you still have options if its becoming increasingly difficult to meet payments. Consider meeting with a counselor from a nonprofit credit counseling agency. They arent mental health professionals, but they can offer financial guidance and help you determine whether you qualify for a debt management plan that consolidates debt into a single payment with a lower interest rate. Your credit cards may be closed if you enroll in this plan, so expect to shift to cash or debit to cover expenses.</p>Lambarena writes for personal finance site NerdWallet.

A look at 2023's new bills<p>Here are two </p> bills<p> to help renters </p> that cleared a major hurdle <p>and one proposal that flopped this week as the Legislature took action</p> <p>before a key deadline on Friday: </p>Passed: Limiting security deposits <p>The </p>California<p> Assembly easily approved a bill to ban landlords from charging more than one month's rent as a security deposit. </p><p>Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat who authored <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB12" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 12</a>, said that surging rent </p>prices have<p> has made it increasingly difficult for renters to pay security deposits, which can equal up to three months worth of rent, or more than $10,000 in some cities. </p> Newsom says the state is on track to cut unsheltered homelessness by 15% <p>"This means a security deposit can be as much as a down payment on a house in many parts of the country," Haney said before the Assembly approved the measure. "This pushes many families, including those with individuals making minimum wage, to either forgo necessities such as food and utilities or acquire more debt in order to be approved for housing." </p><p>Groups representing landlords opposed the measure, arguing that the lack of affordable housing units, not security deposits, </p>are<p> is the real issue facing California renters, and that AB 12 would harm homeowners. </p><p>"Charging security deposits allows for rental property providers to balance risk associated with renting out property," the California Rental Housing Assn. wrote in a bill analysis.</p> <p>"Without the ability to collect enough in security deposit to cover potential damages, rental property providers may decide to remove their homes from the rental market  further exacerbating the housing supply crisis." </p><p>The bill will now be considered by the Senate, which has until Sept. 14 to vote on it. </p> L.A. County's eviction moratorium has expired. What does that mean for renters?Passed: Curbing evictions<p>In 2019, the Legislature hashed out a deal with landlords and realtors on a bill to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-11/california-renters-relief-legislation-gavin-newsom-rent-cap">establish new rules against evictions and cap yearly rent increases to 5% plus inflation</a>. </p><p>But state Sen. Mara Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) said those protections didn't go far enough. Durazo introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB567" target="_blank">Senate Bill 567</a> this year to lower the rent cap to inflation, not to exceed 5% annually, and strengthen oversight of allowable evictions to ensure landlords aren't exploiting what she described as loopholes in the law. </p><p>Facing pressure from business groups, apartment associations and moderate Democrats, Durazo later removed the rent cap provision of the bill. But advocates pushed hard to keep in accountability measures that would ensure landlords are not using evictions to remove a lower-paying tenant to later jack up the rent. </p><p>"We are all feeling the impact of the homeless crisis in our districts," Durazo said during a Wednesday debate over the bill. "Part of what we have to do is stop the flow of families and people into homelessness." </p> California tenants will see cap on rent increases under bill sent to Newsom<p>The changes Durazo made to the bill did little to appease the opposition. Republicans and a handful of Democrats opposed the measure as</p>  unfair and <p>costly to </p> and unfair for<p> homeowners. </p><p>"This bill will affect small rental property owners the most," said Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones of Santee. "This bill goes a little bit too far." </p><p>The measure narrowly passed the Senate and now heads to the Assembly. </p>Failed: Rent control expansion<p>Lawmakers this week killed one proposal to give tenants more protections</p>  through<p> a measure to expand rent control.</p><p>State Sen. Aisha Wahab (D-Hayward) introduced <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB466" target="_blank">Senate Bill 466</a> to update a<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=5.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=2.7.&amp;article=" target="_blank"> 1995 law that limited rent control in California</a> and allow for some newer buildings to become eligible for the price capping. </p><p>"We allow landlords to raise rents with impunity while taxpayers foot the bill for a problem that could be mitigated if jurisdictions were allowed to enact common-sense rent regulation policies," Wahab said during a Wednesday Senate floor debate, while holding up a sleeping bag as a prop to make a point about the worsening homelessness crisis. </p><p>California voters have r<a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2020-11-04/liberal-california-defeated-rent-control-again-housing-crisis">ejected an expansion of rent control twice in recent elections</a>. Landlord groups, including the California Apartment Assn., contend that rent control stymies construction and discourages homeowners from putting new units on the market. </p> Why liberal California keeps saying no to rent control <p>That argument prevailed in the Senate on Wednesday, when SB 466 failed by a large margin </p>when<p> as </p> s<p>everal Democrats either withheld their votes or joined Republicans in opposing the bill. </p><p>It's unusual for Democrats, who control the Legislature, to bring bills to the floor knowing they will fail because it exposes divisions among the ruling party.</p> <p>Wahab said she anticipated her bill would fall short, but that it was important to see who would go on the record in support.</p><p>"I think it's important for advocates and activists to understand who will go up on a tough issue and who really cares about affordable housing," Wahab said. "I thought it really mattered."</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

(Most investments have fees of some kind, but you can minimize those by using exchange traded funds or low-cost index funds.) With permanent life insurance, some of your money goes toward paying premiums for the death benefit and other administrative expenses, including commissions for the person who sells you the policy. The remaining cash can be invested in accounts that are tied to the performance of a stock market index. Your principal is guaranteed, but the amount you earn is subject to caps.</p><p>Financial planners generally recommend that you first max out other retirement savings options, such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-06-19/ira-401k-retirement-account-contributions-differ-explainer">401(k)s and IRAs,</a> before considering investing through a life insurance policy. Also, you should be someone who needs permanent life insurance  the kind that is meant to cover you for the rest of your life. (Term insurance, by contrast, is a much less expensive option meant to cover you for a set term, such as 20 years.)</p><p>Some people do need permanent coverage. Their estates may be large enough to incur estate taxes that they want to pay with insurance, for example. Or they may have a special needs child who will require ongoing support. If you need permanent coverage, consider hiring a fee-only financial planner to help you sort through your options.</p> Here's how to budget your money using the 50/30/20 ruleSocial Security and government pensions<p><b>Dear Liz: </b>When is the sweet spot for me to start receiving Social Security benefits? I am retired and collecting two government pensions  mine and my ex-husbands. I paid into Social Security for 26 years of substantial earnings when I was in the private sector. I do not want to return to work to get to 30 years of substantial earnings in order to avoid the windfall elimination provision reduction. I will reach full retirement age early next year and have a family history of longevity (my parents lived into their 90s). I am paying all of my bills currently but will do more traveling once I am collecting Social Security. Should I wait until 70 to collect? I think I need to live until about 84 to make waiting a good choice. I tried to get this answer from a financial planner at a free seminar and he would not tell me without hiring him for further consultations.</p><p><b>Answer: </b>Thats not surprising. Social Security claiming strategies can be a complex topic, and your situation is more complex than most.</p><p>As you know, the <a href="https://www.aarp.org/retirement/social-security/questions-answers/what-is-the-windfall-elimination-provision.html#:~:text=The%20Windfall%20Elimination%20Provision%20(WEP,not%20pay%20Social%20Security%20taxes." target="_blank">windfall elimination provision</a> can reduce Social Security benefits for people receiving pensions from government jobs that didnt pay into Social Security. The provision doesnt apply to people who have 30 or more years of substantial earnings from jobs that did pay into Social Security. (The amount considered substantial varies by year, but in 2023 its $29,700.) Your 26 years of substantial earnings will mitigate, but not eliminate, the provisions effects.</p><p>Social Security has tools that can help you estimate the impact. Start by opening an account with Social Security, if you havent already, and getting your earnings record from those 26 years. Youll then enter each years worth of substantial earnings into Social Securitys <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/anyPiaWepjs04.html" target="_blank">windfall elimination provision calculator </a>to determine what your benefit is likely to be at various ages.</p><p>Next, consider using a paid Social Security claiming site, such as <a href="https://maximizemysocialsecurity.com/" target="_blank">Maximize My Social Security</a> or <a href="https://www.socialsecuritysolutions.com/" target="_blank">Social Security Solutions,</a> to get recommendations on when to claim rather than using calculators that purport to show a break even age for delaying Social Security. </p><p>These calculators typically dont include important factors such as tax rates, rates of return and, for married couples, future survivor benefits. They also dont really address longevity risk"  the substantial danger that the longer you live, the more likely you are to run through your savings and wind up short of money.</p><p>On the other hand, you have not one but two government pensions that will provide guaranteed income for the rest of your life. If your Social Security benefit is truly fun money, rather than the lifeline it serves as for most people, maximizing your benefit may not be your top priority. But get all the information you can about the cost and benefits of claiming at different ages before making your decision.</p>Liz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for <p><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/" target="_blank">NerdWallet. </a></p>Questions may be sent to her at 3940 Laurel Canyon Blvd., No. 238, Studio City, CA 91604, or by using the "Contact" form at <p><a href="https://asklizweston.com/" target="_blank">asklizweston.com.</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

If youre overwhelmed by your banking options, think about your ability to shape social change with your money by seeking out financial institutions that want to use your money to create a more sustainable and fair world. </p>What is a socially responsible bank?<p>Corporate social responsibility is the self-regulation that businesses do to help promote a positive impact on environmental or social issues, such as racial equity.</p><p>In the banking industry, <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/socially-responsible-banks">social responsibility</a> refers to the ways banks can reduce harm or create opportunities for good. For an eco-conscious bank or credit union, that might mean it doesnt invest in oil pipelines, deforestation or fossil fuels, or it might invest in alternative energy, plant trees or buy<a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-11-29/california-carbon-offset-forest-satellite-climate-change"> carbon offsets.</a> Other banks or credit unions might be committed to equity goals by providing financial literacy programs to their communities or by giving more loans to minority-owned small businesses.</p>Why does it matter where I put my money?<p>Its easy to imagine that the money you keep in your savings account, checking account or certificate of deposit is just waiting for you to use it. But your bank or credit union is using your money to lend to or invest in businesses or other customers. So even if you arent directly giving money to an oil refinery or company thats clearing the Amazon rainforest, your money could still be supporting those initiatives.</p> Venture capital firms form pact to zero out greenhouse emissions<p>The U.S. banking system has a long history of discriminating against people of color, and you can put your money with a bank or credit union thats working to support these marginalized groups. Elizabeth Vivirito, a financial services consultant who specializes in diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, research, said she has observed more robust changes in the banking industry around racial equity since the murder of </p>Black man <p>George Floyd, who was Black, by a Minneapolis police officer in May 2020.</p> We see more people caring about where their money goes and what its funding, Vivirito said.How do I know what my bank is investing in?<p>It can be hard to know what a bank is doing with your money, but there are some ways to tell.</p><p>First, look at the banks website. Does it make any statements about its DEI goals? Does it explicitly say whether it invests in certain industries? Has the bank gone through any third-party certification processes, such as becoming a <a href="https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/certification/">certified B Corp</a> or joining <a href="https://onepercentfortheplanet.org/join">1% for the Planet</a> or the <a href="https://www.gabv.org/">Global Alliance for Banking on Values</a>? These certifications and memberships each have goals and member requirements around sustainability and equity.</p><p>Do a web search of the bank plus any keywords that youd like to investigate, such as social impact or community. This should help you find specific statements or reports from the bank as well as any news or accountability reports from other sources that are keeping tabs on the banks efforts.</p> Roth IRA or traditional IRA? Here's why one might be a better choice for young workersHow can I find a socially responsible bank?<p>First, decide what social responsibility means to you. Do you want a bank committed to fighting climate change? In that case, you may want to choose a bank or credit union that is Fossil Free Certified, a certification from<a href="https://bank.green/" target="_blank"> Bank Green. </a>Do you want to combat financial racism and put your money into businesses that promote equity? Vivirito recommended looking into the history of your bank or credit union to see whom it was created to serve and what its mission is.</p><p>The leadership, strategy and language of the institution should represent their community, Vivirito said.</p><p>One of the easiest things you can do to be more socially conscious with your banking is move your money from a large national financial institution to a local credit union, which will use your money to support other local people, programs and businesses, said Kara Prez, founder of financial education company Bravely Go.</p><p>Thinking about your money in a bigger picture way can help you make better decisions with it, Prez said.

In fact, one researcher who examined the communities between Long Beach and downtown Los Angeles found that <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8zm02483#page=104">more than 75%</a> of the housing units added between 1991 and 2010 were unpermitted. A UCLA professor estimated in 2018 that Los Angeles had <a href="https://blueprint.ucla.edu/feature/world-lessons-of-homelessness/">at least 50,000</a> unpermitted secondary units on single-family lots.</p><p>Unauthorized ADUs proliferated in large part because many California cities made it well-nigh impossible to get permits for them. Those barriers did nothing to reduce the demand for living spaces, particularly from lower-income households whose members <a href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2022-05-18/adu-south-pasadena-multigenerational-housing-with-grandma">spanned multiple generations</a>. "If people dont have housing, they will create housing for themselves and their families," said Rene Schomp, former director of the Napa Sonoma ADU Center.</p><p>But owning an unpermitted ADU carries risks, especially if you rent it out. You'll face fines, insurance problems and, potentially, lawsuits from tenants.</p><p>The incentives for complying may not be enough, though, to persuade you to get the necessary permits. It can take almost as long to get them as it would for a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/newsletters/sign-up-for-you-do-adu">new ADU</a>, and the cost of bringing your unit into compliance can be quite high. </p><p>That's because unpermitted ADUs can have hidden problems in their foundation, framing, wiring and plumbing that can be expensive to fix. "If its a gorgeous unit, that doesnt mean anything," said Avi Levi of Levi Design Build, a developer who does most of his work these days on ADUs.</p>Common compliance issues<p>One reason people build dwelling units without permits is that </p>it <p>the time-consuming process of getting approvals can raise a project's price tag by thousands of dollars. But with no inspectors to ensure that the work complies with city codes, nothing stops a contractor from falling short of the local standards  inadvertently or not.</p><p>"People dont get it," Levi said. "When theyre doing work without a permit, theyre basically letting the person that did the job get away with whatever they wanted to get away with."</p><p>Steven Frasher, spokesman for L.A. County Public Works, offered a list by email when asked what problems the county's inspectors observed most often. "Improper exiting, improper venting of heating devices, undersized wiring, or improper electrical grounding, to name a few, can lead to life safety issues that are both long-term [chronic] or short-term [acute] exposure risks," Frasher said. "Most people are aware of acute risks such as fire, but they tend to not pay enough attention to the chronic risks such as headaches, nausea, and breathing problems can be caused by unpermitted building materials, poor ventilation, and mold caused by improper construction methods."</p><p>And even if the contractor did everything by the book, that may not be enough to bring your unit into compliance years later. Although a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1226">state law passed in 2018</a> allows local officials to judge your ADU by the building codes that were in place when it was built, they have the discretion to insist that you upgrade to newer, more stringent standards.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ladbs.org/docs/default-source/publications/information-bulletins/building-code/accessory-dwelling-unit-conversion-of-existing-detached-structure.pdf?sfvrsn=1c07f453_17" target="_blank">city of Los Angeles</a>, for example, requires unpermitted ADUs to comply with the 2022 state building codes and at least two mandates that probably didn't exist when your ADU was built: the state's <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/building-energy-efficiency-standards">energy efficiency standards</a> and the city's <a href="https://www.ladbs.org/services/green-building-sustainability">Green Building codes</a>.</p><p>Builders and the Casita Coalition, a housing advocacy group that backs ADUs, outlined eight compliance issues frequently encountered by homeowners seeking permits for existing units:</p> <b>Foundation:</b> Most ADUs are converted garages that have a concrete slab foundation that is not stable enough for dwellings  and if the garage was built before 1940, they may have no foundation. In addition to <a href="https://gambrick.com/does-a-concrete-slab-need-footings/" target="_blank">a foundation supported by a sufficient number of footings</a>, these units may need a layer of <a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/s/CRC2019P3/part-iii-building-planning-and-construction/CRC2019P3-Pt03-Ch05-SecR506.2.3">vapor retarder</a>  a feature not required in garages.  <b>Framing:</b> Unpermitted ADUs often are missing some of the structural safety features that dwelling spaces require, such as the full complement of ceiling joists and braced wall panels. Converted garages may also have kept the garage door as an exterior wall, which is a no-no, said Danny Shuster of Los Angeles-based Construction &amp; Consulting Services.  <b>Wiring and plumbing:</b> In 90% of the unpermitted ADUs he's seen, Levi said, the wiring and plumbing aren't up to building-code standards. And in Los Angeles, ADUs must have a separate electrical panel and their own water shut-off valve, along with a source of heat that's not a portable space heater. <b>Utility connections and meters:</b> Depending on your city's requirements, you may need to have separate meters for your ADU's utilities (which you might want anyway for a rental unit). More significantly, jurisdictions have standards for how and where the ADU's sewer line connects to the main sewer in the street, and unpermitted ADUs rarely comply, Shuster said.  <b>Energy efficiency:</b> The state's <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/2019%20Energy%20Code%20-%20ADUs_ADA.pdf">standards for energy efficient buildings</a>, known as <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/building-energy-efficiency-standards/2022-building-energy-efficiency">Title 24</a>, are designed to cut electricity and gas use by sealing buildings off better from the elements. But they could force you to replace old windows that leak heat. <b>Emergency egress:</b> Every bedroom must have an alternate way out in case the door is blocked by fire. As a result, you may have to install a bedroom window large enough for an adult to climb out of. <b>Water heater:</b> If your ADU's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-04-20/how-to-switch-from-gas-to-electric-appliances">gas water heater</a> is in a bedroom, it will need to be <a href="https://up.codes/viewer/california/ca-plumbing-code-2016/chapter/5/water-heaters#5">enclosed in a closet that meets state rules</a>. It will also need to be at least five feet from the property line, as will any heating or cooling appliances, Shuster said. <b>Firewall:</b> Any exterior wall of an ADU that's less than 5 feet from the property line must be built to suppress fire for at least 1 hour. Unless your ADU was built fairly recently, you'll probably have to retrofit it with fire-resistant boards on the inside of the wall.<p>It's conceivable that your ADU may not even be permittable, thanks to a non</p>-<p>compliant feature that would be prohibitively expensive to fix  for example, a ceiling that's too low or the lack of a separate entrance. Another issue for converted garages, Shuster said, is that the exterior walls may have been extended to allow for a larger ADU. If the ADU is closer to the property line than current zoning rules allow, he said, only the portion representing the original garage's footprint will be grandfathered  the walls and roofline for the additional space will have to be moved back. Ouch.</p> What will an ADU do to your property taxes and resale value?The path to permits<p>Not too long ago, there was no way to bring an unpermitted ADU into compliance if it violated setback requirements, limits on lot coverage or other zoning rules. If code enforcers cited your unit, you'd probably have to decide whether to return the space to its original use (e.g., a garage) or dismantle it. </p><p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1069">Senate Bill 1069</a>, which lawmakers passed in 2016 to make it easier to build ADUs, forced cities to issue permits "for any existing structure that had been or could be converted to an ADU, so that informal units had a path to safety," Denise Pinkston, president of the Casita Coalition and a key proponent of the bill, said in an email. Now, Pinkston said, the main impediments are the cost of upgrades, the shortage of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/newsletter/2023-04-05/how-to-finance-and-pay-for-adu-you-do-adu">financing options</a>, and a general mistrust of government, including fear of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-03-08/building-an-adu-what-you-need-to-know-about-rent-control">rent control among ADU owners</a>, she said.</p><p>Nevertheless, contractors say they're being approached more and more frequently by owners of unpermitted ADUs who are thinking about applying for permits. Levi said he gets at least two such calls a week  sometimes from people who were buying or had bought a lot with an unpermitted ADU, but mainly from property owners who had deliberately built units without getting permits.</p><p>About 80% of the time, he said, the ADU is a converted garage. And most of the calls are coming from people who've already gotten a citation from local authorities or who know they're about to get one, Levi said.</p> You Do ADU, Part 5: Avoiding costly delays in your ADU projectHow to get started <p>If you own an unpermitted ADU, chances are good that you're well aware of the problem. Either you decided to forgo permits when you built it; or, if the ADU was on the property when you bought it, the seller's agent and the reports you received from the inspector and the title insurance company told you that the space wasn't legal. But if you have any doubt, your local government's planning and building-and-safety departments will have records of any permits or certificates of occupancy obtained for your ADU. Many cities, including <a href="https://www.ladbs.org/services/check-status/online-building-records">Los Angeles</a>, enable you to do this online.</p><p>Seeking permits retroactively for an ADU will put you in an uncomfortable spot, Levi said: Once you reveal to the city that you have a potentially unsafe dwelling, you'll have to either bring it into compliance or stop using it as a living space  and maybe even demolish it, depending on how severe the safety problems are.</p><p>So the first step is to find out as much as you can from your city before outing your non</p>-<p>compliant unit. Some jurisdictions, including <a href="https://sf.gov/step-by-step/legalize-unit-your-home">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://www.ci.milpitas.ca.gov/milpitas-departments-building-and-safety-department-safe-adu-legalization-program/">Milpitas</a>, will try to help you figure out how much work you'll have to do to meet current codes before you seek the necessary permits. And a few, such as <a href="https://www.sccoplanning.com/PlanningHome/BuildingSafety/SafeStructuresProgram(formerlyLIAP).aspx">Santa Cruz County</a>, will allow you to keep renting out the unit without meeting all of today's building codes, as long as your unit meets health and safety standards.</p><p>Pasadena has even offered local homeowners financial assistance to bring existing ADUs up to code through its <a href="https://www.cityofpasadena.net/housing/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/Option-2-Application-Unpermitted-ADU.pdf?v=1602979200027" target="_blank">Second Unit ADU Program</a>, but it's not taking new applications at the moment. According to the <a href="https://www.cityofpasadena.net/housing/second-unit-adu-program/">Pasadena Department of Housing's website</a>, "The application window is tentatively scheduled to open back up in summer 2023." </p><p>The city of Los Angeles offers a <a href="https://www.ladbs.org/services/core-services/plan-check-permit/plan-check-permit-special-assistance/preliminary-plan-check">preliminary plan check</a> service (for a fee of at least $227) that can identify building and zoning issues in your plans up front, as well as a call center to answer your questions about local codes, Frank Lara of the L.A. Department of Building &amp; Safety said via email. He also said that merely seeking permits won't cause an ADU owner to be cited for code violations  the city issues citations in response to complaints, not permit applications.</p>Los Angeles also has a <p><a href="https://planning.lacity.org/plans-policies/unpermitted-dwelling-units">legalization program for "unapproved dwelling units"</a></p> in multifamily zones, but it offers no shortcuts. Owners have to bring their units into full compliance with city codes and sign a 55-year commitment to charging below-market rents for one or more of the units newly permitted. The rents would have to be affordable to low-income or moderate-income tenants, depending on the neighborhood's income level.<p>(To ease the path to permits, the L.A. City Council approved a <a href="https://lacity.primegov.com/portal/viewer?id=428227&amp;type=2" target="_blank">motion</a> in April to allow owners of unpermitted ADUs to get city approvals without first having to return the unit to its original use  for example, turning a converted garage ADU back into a fully permitted garage. The motion also called for the development of an amnesty program for legalizing unpermitted ADUs, although it set no deadline.)</p> You Do ADU, Part 4: Finding the right contractorLooking behind the walls<p>Next, you'll want to get some <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/newsletter/2023-04-19/finding-help-to-build-adu-in-california-you-do-adu">professional help</a> (for your project, not for you personally  at least not at this juncture). You'll need a licensed architect or structural engineer to sign off on your plans and a licensed contractor to do the work, but first you may want to consult with a pro who can give you a rough idea of what your ADU might require. That way you'll at least know the scale of what you're getting yourself into.</p><p>The process of obtaining permits starts with you submitting for review an "as built" ADU plan that hews closely to the current structure. "The city's going to give their own comments about what they want us to comply with  what they will allow and what they will not allow," Levi said, adding that the plans will go through several revisions and reviews before they're approved.</p><p>How long that process takes will depend on whether you're in a <a href="https://planning.lacity.org/preservation-design/local-historic-districts">historic preservation overlay zone</a>, an environmentally sensitive area or other locale that requires extra layers of scrutiny, Shuster said, adding, "It could take a few short weeks; it could take months."</p><p>Once the plans are approved  and remember, this hurdle is significantly lower than it used to be  building and safety inspectors will come out to see how much work needs to be done to bring your unit into compliance. This preconstruction inspection is also a deconstruction inspection, as inspectors will want to tear up walls to check the condition of the wiring and plumbing behind them, as well as looking at the footings under the foundation and other important and potentially inadequate features.</p><p>Shuster said these inspections play out in one of three ways, the first being that the unit has to be gutted to expose the framing and foundation because the inspector thinks everything's out of compliance. He's seen this happen to maybe 10% of the units he's worked on, and it came as no surprise because they were in such bad shape. The second possibility is that the inspector says the unit appears to be largely in compliance and pokes the minimum number of holes in the walls. That happens less than 10% of the time, Shuster said.</p><p>The most common scenario, he said, is that inspectors will say the unit looks OK but still want to look at the foundation and the framing, measure the insulation, inspect the plumbing and piping, check the wiring and the electrical panel. They may start by pointing out four or five locations where they want the frame or foundation exposed, then ask for more based on what they see.</p> You Do ADU, Part 2: How to pay for your ADUHow much is this going to cost?<p>Shuster said that bringing a converted garage into compliance would cost $20,000 to $30,000 under the best</p> -<p>case scenario, and possibly more than $100,000. Levi pegged the cost of legalizing a garage ADU at $50,000 to $130,000. </p><p>The least expensive job is still pretty costly because of the up-front expense of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/newsletter/2023-04-12/creating-your-design-layout-for-your-adu-you-do-adu">developing plans</a> and getting them approved. The Casita Coalition estimated that the price tag for plans and permits started at $10,000 and went up from there.</p><p>In addition, once your ADU is officially on the city's books, its value will be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2023-05-12/what-is-an-adu-worth-theres-no-simple-answer-yet">added to your property tax assessment</a>, increasing your property taxes.</p><p>On the other hand, an unpermitted ADU can prove costly too. </p><p>It's not just the prospect of getting hit with one or more citations for code violations if someone reports you to the city. It's also what happens after the citation is issued. </p><p>If you have tenants, the Casita Coalition says, you may have to cover their relocation costs and reimburse them for the rent they'd paid. And even if you aren't cited by the city, your tenant may <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/California-Tenants-Guide.pdf">sue you for providing seriously substandard housing</a>, potentially collecting extra damages in addition to recovering their rent payments. </p><p>Another issue is that your insurer could exclude unpermitted structures from your coverage, said Janet Ruiz, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. If there's a fire or some other kind of damage to that property, you could be on the hook for the entire loss.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That means Wall Streets main measure of health has climbed out of a painful bear market, which saw it drop 25.4% over roughly nine months.The S tandard &amp; P oor's 500 was virtually unchanged in early trading, and it hasnt moved by more than 0.4% in any day this week. <p>The Dow Jones industrial average </p> added 168 points, or  0.5%was basically flat at 33,665, as of 9:40 a.m. Eastern time<p>, while the Nasdaq composite </p> led the market with a 1% risewas 0.2% higher<p>. </p> Thats been the norm so far this bull run, as chip maker Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks have been responsible for the lions share of Wall Streets gains. Declaring the end of a bear market&nbsp;may seem arbitrary, and different market watchers use different definitions, but it offers a useful marker for investors. It also provides a reminder that investors able to hold on through <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-02-09/q-a-wheres-the-recession-and-is-it-still-coming">downturns</a></p>  have nearly always made back all their losses in S&amp;P 500 index funds eventually. Even though it was driven by so many superlatives  the worst <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-02-15/retail-sales-jump-americans-defy-inflation-interest-rate-hikes">inflation</a></p>  in generations and the fastest hikes to  interest rate  increases  in decades, for example  this most recent bear market lasted only about nine months. It stretched from Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&amp;P 500 set a record, until Oct. 12, when it hit bottom. Thats shorter than the typical bear market, and it also resulted in a shallower loss than average, according to data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Medical bills pushed a Santa Monica family into poverty. They're not alone In hindsight, it might not look that bad, but it certainly feels bad in the moment, said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual. What made last year even more painful for investors is that both stocks and bonds lost money, he said, something that hasnt happened in decades. A good chunk of this bull markets gains has been because the economy has refused to fall into a recession despite repeated predictions for one. Its has  withstood the highest interest rates since 2007, three high-profile collapses of U.S. banks since March, another threat by the U.S. government of an economy-shaking default on its debt and a series of other challenges. Bottom line, the economy has been very resilient, said Anthony Saglimbene, chief markets strategist at Ameriprise Financial. So much negativity was built into the market, he said. While its too early to know this for sure, stocks look like theyre doing what they normally do when all the negativity has been discounted into the stock market: They start moving higher in anticipation of better days ahead. With high food prices, grocery shopping has become a strategy game. Angelenos share how they get byNot only has  The economy  has  avoided a recession because of a remarkably solid job market and spending by consumers,  and  hopes are also rising that the Fed may soon stop hiking  raising  interest rates.<p>High rates work to undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy and dragging on prices for stocks and other investments.</p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-25/column-gamestop-meme-stocks">GameStop</a></p> was one of the bigger movers, falling 16.9% after ousting its CEO who was brought in to turn around the struggling video game retailer. The company, whose stock became a sensation in 2021 during the meme-stock craze, also reported weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected.On the winning side was Carvana. It rose 18.4% after saying it expects to book a record amount of profit on each vehicle sold during the current quarter, among other improving trends.The overall market has been mostly calm after charging higher last week on data suggesting a long-feared <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-02-09/q-a-wheres-the-recession-and-is-it-still-coming">recession</a></p> may not be so imminent. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed close to the edge of a bull market, rising nearly 20% above where it was in mid-October.But Wall Streets worries arent over yet. The question is still whether a recession will hit before inflation falls enough to get the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates. The Fed has already hiked short-term rates to their highest level since 2007 in hopes of driving down the worst inflation in generations.High rates do that by slowing the entire economy and dragging on prices for stocks and other investments. The Feds sharp hikes have already helped cause several high-profile U.S. bank failures, as well as several months of contraction for the manufacturing industry.Thats why Wall Streets focus is on next week. Thats when the U.S. government will provide the latest monthly updates on inflation and the Fed will also announce its latest move on interest rates.Inflation remains the name of the game, said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. <p>The </p> broad <p>expectation among traders is that the Fed </p> will hold rates steady&nbsp;next week, will make no move on Thursday,<p> which would be the first meeting where it hasnt </p>hiked  raised<p> rates in more than a year. </p>While  Although  it may hike rates one more time in July, the hope on Wall Street is that it wont go beyond that. Inflation has been coming down from its peak last summer.Even though inflation remains well above the Fed's comfort level, a pause would give the central bank more time to see how its fusillade of hikes has affected the economy. But traders see the Fed hiking rates again in July. But many challenges still remain for the stock market. Chief among them is that no one can be sure when the Fed will stop hiking  raising  rates. Even if inflation has eased, its remained stubbornly above the Feds comfort level and still causes pain for all kinds of households, particularly ones with lower incomes. That has some investors continuing to prepare for a coming recession, even if they keep pushing out predictions for when it will arrive by a few months. Its been an odd and uneven recovery coming out of the recession caused  by  the COVID-19 pandemic, Northwestern Mutuals Schutte said. Its been an odd and even push into recession. Another warning sign for skeptics is how much of the S&amp;P 500s gains have been concentrated this year within just a handful of stocks. Hopes for a pause by the Fed have helped big, high-growth stocks in particular. Investors see them benefiting the most from easier <p>stable</p>  interest rates because thats whats happened in the past. Add on top of that euphoria around artificial intelligence fanned by last months tremendous sales forecast by Nvidia, and just seven stocks have been responsible for the majority of the S&amp;P 500s gain this year. Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech giants  companies  have huge influence on the S&amp;P 500 because theyre the biggest, and the index gives more weight to stocks based on their size. Nearly half the stocks in the S&amp;P 500, meanwhile, are down for the year so far. Thursday offered a good example. The biggest forces pushing the S&amp;P 500 upward included Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Big Tech gained as expectations built for the Fed to take a pause on rates next week. That was because <p>a report</p>on Thursday helped firm expectations that the Fed will not raise rates further next week. It showed the highest number of U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week since October 2021.that more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week than expected, the highest since October 2021. A cooling labor market could push against  release  pressure that may have built for tougher policy after central banks in Canada and Australia hiked  raised  their own interest rates recently. But the S&amp;P 500 was nearly split between winners and losers. Smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index, meanwhile, slipped 0.4%. The arrival of a bull market also doesnt mean the stock market has made it back to its prior heights. A 25% drop for the S&amp;P 500 requires a 33% rally to follow in order to  just  to  get back to even. All told, the S&amp;P 500 rose 26.41 points to 4,293.93. The Dow gained 168.59  points  to 33,833.61, and the Nasdaq rose 133.63  points  to 13,238.52.The job market has remained remarkably resilient in the face of higher interest rates, and weakness there could quickly get the Fed to take it easier on rates. Thursday's data helped push against pressure that may have built for tougher policy after central banks in Canada and Australia hiked their own rates recently.Economists warn the weekly data for jobless claims is  are prone to sharp shifts, and we would caution against overemphasizing one weeks data, said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U .S . Eeconomist at High Frequency Economics. After the unemployment data hit the market,<p><b> </b>Treasury yields gave up gains from earlier in the morning</p> after the unemployment data hit the market<p>. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.7</p> 15<p>% from 3.78% late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.</p><p>The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.4</p> 38<p>% from 4.55%.</p>In Europe, stock indexes were moving only modestly after revised figures released Thursday showed the European economy contracted slightly at the end of last year and beginning of 2023.That means the eurozone shrank for two straight quarters, which is what some call a technical recession.In Asia, Japans benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 0.9% after the Japanese government revised its estimate for growth in the January-March quarter sharply higher, to 2.7%. That was above what analysts had expected and raises questions about whether Japan's central bank will keep its easy policies on interest rates. While a higher growth reading may provide some room to consider a policy exit from the Bank of Japan, the central banks stance could remain unmoved for now, with recent comments from the Governor Kazuo Ueda pointing to more wait-and-see, Yeap Jun Rong, a market analyst at IG , said in a report.

Now comes the fallout<p>Governments and companies over the years have found that using sporting events  sponsoring a team or tour, for instance, or going all out and hosting the World Cup or the Olympics  is a particularly effective tool to paint themselves in a more flattering light while also potentially enriching their coffers through lucrative broadcast rights deals and other spending. </p><p>"Sport reaches more and different people than other communication tools," said Steve Cockburn, head of economic and social justice at Amnesty International. "A lot of people feel very deeply and connect deeply with sports."</p><p>Using sports to launder a government's image has several historical precedents. Hitler used the <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-nazi-olympics-berlin-1936" target="_blank">1936 Olympics</a> to build support for Nazi Germany, while Mussolini saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/apr/01/world-cup-moments-1938-italy-benito-mussolini" target="_blank">Italy's 1938 World Cup win</a> as a way to galvanize support for his fascist regime.</p><p>More recently, human rights activists raised concerns about China hosting the 2008 and 2022 Olympics, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-02-16/southern-california-uyghurs-olympics">despite human rights abuses against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang,</a> or Russia hosting the 2014 Sochi Olympics <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-russian-olympics-boycott-rejected-20130812-story.html">after the country passed anti-LGBTQ+ legislation.</a> Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup brought <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-16/qatars-world-cup-denounced-for-washing-countrys-image">similar image-scrubbing complaints.</a></p><p>Sports in general is a very galvanizing event or cultural phenomenon. It brings people together," said Yoav Dubinsky, instructor of sports business at the University of Oregon's Lundquist College of Business. "Sports events are the most watched telecasts on television</p>,<p>. TV rights are the main source of revenue for professional sports because of their popularity, which means that the eyes of the world and the eyes of fans are on the sports.</p>"<p>"As a byproduct, the countries or cities or states try to capitalize on that attention to show the aspects of the countries that they want to showcase</p>,<p>." </p>he said.

"You find a way to create a clarity in your own mind about what you're able to cheer for and, oftentimes</p>,<p><b> </b>... youre not as concerned about this particular issue."</p><p>For governments, the investment in</p>to<p> leagues or individual teams, such as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-newcastle-english-premier-league-11633614078?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Saudi Public Investment Fund's purchase of Newcastle United,</a> is negligible, experts said. The increased foray into sports is a show of strength and diplomacy, a use of soft power.</p><p>These are trophy investments," Cockburn said. "What theyre gaining is a huge cultural investment, loyalty from certain groups of the population and loyalty from politicians who don't want to see that investment go away."</p><p>Getting more involved in sports can be a double-edged sword for countries with a record of human rights violations. More involvement can lead to more scrutiny of their past record on human rights, but at the same time, it can also allow for more opportunity to showcase desirable parts of a regime.</p> Plaschke: PGA commits heinous act of hypocrisy by merging with LIV Golf<p>The collaboration with the PGA now gives the Saudis a kosher stamp as a legitimate business partner in the U.S.," said Dubinsky of the University of Oregon.</p><p>It's unclear whether Saudi Arabia's increased presence in golf will allow the country to remake its image. In a <a href="https://blogs.shu.edu/sportspoll/2022/11/03/public-says-liv-has-diminished-pga-and-pro-golf-by-more-than-2-to-1-margin-say-liv-is-saudi-sportswashing/" target="_blank">poll conducted last year by Seton Hall University</a>, 43% of "general population" respondents said the Saudi-backed LIV Golf looked like "sportswashing," with that percentage increasing to 52% among "avid fans."</p><p>You've seen a lot of resistance to LIV Golf among the fan base," </p>said <p>McManus of Seton Hall </p> said<p>.

They've been welcomed into the highest government policy councils. They became fixtures on television news shows and were quoted </p> incessantly constantly <p>by some of the nation's leading newspapers.</p><p>They're </p> a <p>cadre of academics and scientists who pushed a discredited solution to the COVID pandemic, shunning masks, school closings, even vaccines, all in the name of reaching the elusive goal of "herd immunity," resulting in what may have been hundreds of thousands of unnecessary American deaths. </p><p>That's the contention of <a href="https://redhawkpublications.com/We-Want-Them-Infected-p547021769" target="_blank">"We Want Them Infected,"</a> a painstakingly documented new book by Jonathan Howard, a neurologist at New York University and a veteran debunker of the pseudoscience contaminating our efforts to fight the pandemic.</p> In 2019 you would have been considered a quack if you suggested that the best way to get rid of a virus is to spread the virus. But that became mainstream and influenced politicians at the highest levels.<p>Howard takes his title from Paul Alexander, an epidemiologist in the Health and Human Services Department during the Trump administration. </p><p>In July 2020, Alexander offered his view of <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000176-6c7e-d0c3-ab77-7dff0c950001" target="_blank">how to exploit the relative risks of COVID</a> to discrete populations to reach herd immunity. </p> The idea was that so many people would eventually become naturally infected with the virus, and therefore immune from further infection, that the virus would be unable to spread further<p>. </p><p>"Infants, kids, teens, young people, young adults, middle aged with no conditions etc. have zero to little risk," he told top HHS officials. "So we use them to develop herd ... we want them infected."</p><p>Alexander's proposal was essentially a screed against lockdowns. That suited the Trump White House, which was searching for ways around the economic dislocations caused by the virus. But he was wrong about the toll of sickness and death that would result, allowing the virus to rage among these ostensibly low-risk groups, and wrong about the prospects of reaching herd immunity naturally.</p><p>"We Want Them Infected" may be the most appalling and infuriating book you'll read about America's response to the pandemic. It's also essential reading.</p> The book is populated by quacks, mountebanks and charlatans  and not a few scholars with distinguished academic records  many of whom appear to have been seduced by the embrace of the right-wing echo chamber into promoting unproven and disproved policies. <p>"It's unbelievable that while doctors like myself were working to treat sick COVID patients, begging people to stay at home and be safe," Howard told me, "there was another group of doctors working at cross-currents to us  prominent doctors wanting to purposely infect unvaccinated young people with the promise that herd immunity would arrive in a couple of months."</p><p>They consistently minimized the gravity of the pandemic, but rarely if ever acknowledged that their optimistic forecasts of illness and deaths were consistently proved wrong. </p> There are a number of problems with the herd immunity theory. One is that immunity from COVID infection tends to wane over time rather than become permanent. Also, infection with one variant of the virus doesn't necessarily confer immunity from other variants, of which there have been many. Column: COVID boosted anti-vaccine propaganda. Now measles and other childhood diseases are on the march Another problem is that COVID can be a devastating disease for victims of any age. Allowing anyone to become infected can expose them to serious health problems.   Moreover, the prospect that COVID could be defeated by the natural expansion of herd immunity persuaded many people not to bother with proven countermeasures, including social distancing, masking and vaccination.  <p>Today, more than three years after COVID first appeared, the U.S. still has not achieved herd immunity </p> although it is nearing the goal, <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bob_wachter/status/1660819445059846144" target="_blank">     in the view of Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at UC San Francisco  </a>. The disease's trajectory has been cataclysmic  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm" target="_blank">the U.S. death toll stands at 1.13 million</a>, hundreds of children have died, and an estimated <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_USA/" target="_blank">245,000 children have lost one or both parents</a> to COVID. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">U.S. leads the world</a> in COVID deaths; its death rate of 3,478 per million population is worse than that of Britain, Spain, France, the Nordic countries, Canada and Israel.</p> Some herd immunity advocates<p> offered their blithe forecasts in a misguided, if not dishonest, attempt to provide comfort to the American public. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, urged HHS officials in March 2020 to advocate against lockdowns on grounds they were <a href="https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo190652/20220621TheTrumpAdministrationsEmbraceofaDangerousandDiscreditedHerdImmunityviaMassInfectionStrategy.pdf" target="_blank">"inciting irrational fear"</a> of the virus, which he estimated would cause about 10,000 deaths. "The panic needs to be stopped," Atlas wrote.</p><p>Atlas soon became a top advisor to Trump, promoting the herd immunity theory in the White House despite the objections of more experienced advisors such as Dr. Deborah Birx. </p> Howard is especially disturbed at how politicizing the pandemic has allowed fringe ideas to infiltrate public health policies. "In 2019 you would have been considered a quack if you suggested that the best way to get rid of a virus is to spread the virus," he says. "But that became mainstream and influenced politicians at the highest levels."<p>In his book, Howard reserves his deepest scorn for the promoters of the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank">"Great Barrington Declaration,"</a> a manifesto for herd immunity published in October 2020 and signed initially by epidemiologists Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford; Martin Kulldorff, then of Harvard; and Sunetra Gupta of Oxford. (Thousands of other academics and scientists would later add their signatures.) </p><p>The core of the declaration was opposition to lockdowns. Its solution was what its drafters called "focused protection," which meant allowing "those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk"  chiefly seniors.</p><p>Older people living at home, the declaration said, should be kept apart from other family members except by meeting them outside, and "should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home."</p><p>Focused protection, the promoters wrote, would allow society to achieve herd immunity and return to normalcy in <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank">three to six months</a>. </p><p>As Howard documents, the declaration was little more than a libertarian fantasy. That may not have been surprising, because one of its organizers was an arch-libertarian named Jeffrey Tucker. </p> Column: COVID boosted anti-vaccine propaganda. Now measles and other childhood diseases are on the march<p>For a taste of Tucker's worldview, consider a 2016 article entitled <a href="https://fee.org/articles/let-the-kids-work/" target="_blank">"Let the kids work."</a> There he ridiculed the Washington Post for publishing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2016/10/31/20-haunting-portraits-of-child-laborers-in-1900s-america/" target="_blank">a photo gallery of child laborers</a> from 100 years ago, including miners and sweatshop workers as young as 10. </p><p>Tucker's response was that those children were "working in the adult world, surrounded by cool bustling things and new technology. They are on the streets, in the factories, in the mines, with adults and with peers, learning and doing. They are being valued for what they do, which is to say being valued as people.... Whatever else you want to say about this, its an exciting life." </p> A better life, at least, than "pushed by compulsion into government holding tanks for a full decade"  that is, going to school.<p>The declaration's promoters, Howard writes, never specified how to achieve their goals. Delivering food and supplies to millions of housebound seniors? In a Hoover Institution interview, Bhattacharya said, "We could have offered free DoorDash to older people." </p><p>As Howard observes, Bhattacharya was remarkably sanguine about "creating a program overnight to deliver fresh food to tens of millions of</p> senior  seniors<p> for months on end throughout the entire country."</p><p>Similar hand-waving addressed the problems of multigenerational households, in which millions of vulnerable elders live. Older family members, the declaration authors wrote, "might temporarily be able to live with an older friend or sibling, with whom they can self-isolate together during the height of community transmission. As a last resort, empty hotel rooms could be used for temporary housing."</p><p>Of course, hermetically sealing off tens of millions of "nonvulnerable" people from tens of millions of vulnerable people in a few weeks would be "the single greatest logistical challenge humanity had ever undertaken," Howard observes. "Nowhere in the world used focused protection to achieve herd immunity in three to six months, as the Great Barrington Declaration promised." </p><p>What the declaration really promoted was complacency. Its drafters, Howard says, were "people with no real-world responsibility for much of anything who </p> <p>made impossible things sound very easy. The task of actually getting food into the houses of elderly people was left up to public health authorities who were understaffed, overwhelmed and underfunded."</p> Column: Did Sweden beat the pandemic by refusing to lock down? No, its record is disastrous<p>What may be the most inexcusable element of the herd immunity movement was its implication that children could be used as shields for the rest of the population. Its advocates counseled against vaccinating young children on the grounds that their susceptibility to the virus was minimal or even nonexistent, so they could safely acquire immunity naturally  and perhaps, <a href="https://unherd.com/2022/02/should-we-let-children-catch-omicron/" target="_blank">as Vinay Prasad of UC San Francisco implied</a>, provide an immunity boost to adults in their families. </p><p>Yet although children tended to suffer less from symptoms when they were infected, they were anything but immune. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge" target="_blank">more than 1,600 American children</a> under the age of 18 have died from COVID during the pandemic.</p><p>In any case, death is not the only serious outcome from COVID. The CDC says more than <a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/covid19_5.html" target="_blank">14,000 children were hospitalized</a> for COVID during the pandemic. An untold number of children may suffer from long COVID or other lifelong manifestations of the disease. For doctors to counsel deliberately exposing children to COVID when a vaccine is available, especially if the purpose is to protect adults, is "a moral abomination," Howard says. He's right.</p><p>In a world guided by science, the promoters of an unsuccessful herd immunity theory would long ago have lost their credibility and their public soapboxes. </p><p>The opposite has happened. Bhattacharya and Kulldorff still have their platforms (Kulldorff is now associated with the right-wing Hillsdale College). Both were appointed in December by Florida's anti-vaccine governor, Ron DeSantis, to a <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2022/12/13/governor-ron-desantis-petitions-florida-supreme-court-for-statewide-grand-jury-on-covid-19-vaccines-and-announces-creation-of-the-public-health-integrity-committee/" target="_blank">"Public Health Integrity Committee"</a> charged with questioning federal public health policies. </p><p>Scott Atlas, meanwhile, was tapped to deliver the commencement address at New College of Florida, a once-renowned liberal arts institution that DeSantis has turned into a haven for right-wing pedagogy. He was greeted with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/20/us/scott-atlas-new-college-florida-keynote-speech-boos/index.html" target="_blank">boos from the audience of graduating seniors</a>, however, indicating that the youth of America perhaps can't be gulled as easily as their parents.</p><p>At this moment, anti-science ideology on the right appears to be in the ascendance. Agitation against the COVID vaccine is </p>metastatizing  metastasizing <p>into an opposition movement against all childhood vaccinations, a trend that threatens to produce <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-11-30/the-anti-vax-movement-is-fostering-a-measles-epidemic">a surge in other vaccine-preventable diseases</a> such as measles and polio. </p><p>"The anti-vaccine movement has spotted an opportunity to sow doubt," Howard told me. "Getting rid of all school vaccine mandates has always been the Holy Grail for them." </p><p>Howard's book is a warning. We may be on the verge of a public health disaster, because the promoters of a failed theory that COVID could be fought through "natural immunity" without vaccines have been able to wrap themselves in the mantle of truth-tellers. But they're not.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
