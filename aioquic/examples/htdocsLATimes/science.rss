The last time the air had similar amounts was during a less-hospitable hothouse Earth before human civilization took root, scientists said.</p><p>The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/broken-record-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-levels-jump-again">announced</a> that the carbon dioxide level measured <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/">in May in Hawaii averaged 424 parts per million</a>. Thats 3 parts per million more than last years May average and 51% higher than <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/graphic-the-relentless-rise-of-carbon-dioxide/">preindustrial levels of 280 parts per million</a>.</p><p>It is one of the largest annual May-to-May increases in carbon dioxide levels on record, behind only 2016 and 2019, which had jumps of 3.7 and 3.4 parts per million.</p><p>To me as an atmospheric scientist, that trend is very concerning, said NOAA greenhouse gas monitoring group leader <a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/staff/Arlyn.Andrews/">Arlyn Andrews</a>. Not only is CO2 continuing to increase despite efforts to start reducing emissions, but its increasing faster than it was 10 or 20 years ago.</p> Climate change is rapidly accelerating in California, state report says<p>Emissions used to increase by maybe 1 part per million per year, but now they are increasing at twice and even three times that rate, depending on whether there is an El Nio, Andrews said.</p><p>The relentless rise in atmospheric CO2 is incredibly worrying if not wholly predictable, said Brown University climate scientist <a href="https://ibes.brown.edu/people/kim-cobb">Kim Cobb</a>, who was not part of the research.</p><p>Carbon dioxide levels have been rising steadily, with each years measurement higher than the last. However, theres a seasonal cycle with carbon dioxide so that it reaches its highest saturation point in May.</p><p>Thats because two-thirds of the land globally is in the Northern Hemisphere, where plants suck the most carbon dioxide out of the air during late spring and summer, causing levels to fall. They start rising again in November, Andrews said.</p><p>Carbon dioxide levels rise more during El Nio climate cycles because it is drier in the Northern Hemisphere. An El Nio is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-05-19/return-of-el-nino-would-have-far-reaching-impacts">thought to be brewing now</a>, which may help explain the large year-to-year increase, she said.</p> El Nio is likely returning, bringing danger for California and the world. 'We need to be prepared' <p>There are two main ways of tracking greenhouse gases. One is to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting">monitor whats coming out</a> of smokestacks and exhaust pipes, but about half of that is absorbed by the oceans and lands, Andrews said.</p><p>The other way is to measure <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-are-gases-atmosphere-analyzed-and-measured">how much carbon dioxide is in the air</a>. NOAA and partner agencies measure all around the world.</p><p>Hawaii has the longest history of direct measurements and is the home of the Scripps Institution of Oceanographys <a href="https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/">Keeling Curve,</a> which has kept track of carbon in the air since 1958 when the May reading peaked at 317.5. Emissions have gone up about 33% since then.</p><p>Current emissions are going to remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years, and theyre going to continue to trap heat energy near Earths surface for thousands of years, Andrews said.</p><p>Because of that, we are still dealing with CO2 in the atmosphere that was emitted in the early-to-mid-20th century, University of Oklahoma meteorology professor <a href="http://meteorology.ou.edu/member/jason-furtado/">Jason Furtado</a>, who wasnt part of the monitoring teams, said in an email.</p><p>This is why we have to see emissions DROP in order to have a chance to reverse climate change. And even if/when we reverse the CO2 emissions rate, it will take some time before the climate system responds, he said.</p> Editorial: Were cementing climate denial with every fossil fuel project<p>This year NOAA had a complication in its reading.</p><p>NOAA and the Scripps Institution have two distinct monitors that have slightly different measurements. Scripps measured 423.8 parts per million and often runs a bit below NOAA. Both have been at the remote Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii for decades, but <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-11-28/hawaii-mauna-loa-starts-erupt-spewing-ash">Novembers eruption</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/volcanic-eruptions-science-business-hawaii-mauna-loa-82dfd308cc32a6138bd0f50df1298f8c">cut off power to the NOAA monitor</a> and its been unable to use it since. NOAA established another one at Mauna Kea, 21 miles away.</p><p>Scripps got their Mauna Loa site working and put one at Mauna Kea as well.</p><p>Many scientists advocate for returning to 350-parts-per-million levels.</p><p>CO2 now is higher than any time in the last 4 to 4.5 million years, when the atmosphere was about 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer and sea levels were [16 to 82 feet] higher, Andrews said.</p><p>Back then, the buildup of carbon dioxide was much more gradual, allowing heat to build and ice to melt to raise seas, scientists said.</p><p>We are absolutely at levels unseen in human civilization, Furtado said.</p><p>Humans are running a massive experiment on the Earths climate system via burning carbon, and the results are turning out <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-02-14/western-megadrought-driest-in-1200-years">not great for a lot of people</a> on this planet.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

As a transplant infectious disease doctor on the front lines, I understand why. </p><p>In the first five months of 2023, COVID caused <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00">more than 37,000 deaths</a> in the U.S., a typical toll from the flu in an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html">entire year</a>. <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2022/07/22/covid-endemicity">Scientists estimate</a> an annual U.S. COVID death rate of at least <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/20/opinion/covid-19-deaths-vaccines-endemic.html">100,000</a>, dwarfing other infectious diseases. And the virus continues to evolve: The highly transmissible XBB.1.16 subvariant (Arcturus), currently making up about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank">15% of cases nationally</a>, is expected to be the dominant strain by summer. Wastewater surveillance is also showing an uptick in the virus in <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/is-covid-back-in-nyc-wastewater-surveillance-shows-coronavirus-is-rising">New York City</a> and elsewhere. </p><p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.html">Meanwhile, the federal public health emergency</a> ended last month, and across the country the pandemic has moved to back of mind. Its not surprising that the most vulnerable feel left behind.</p><p>Yet at the same time, health professionals are optimistic about todays anti-COVID arsenal. Biomedical advances have revolutionized our ability to thwart serious disease and death from the virus, even as it mutates. The bivalent vaccines are about <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00122-6/fulltext#:~:text=Our%20findings%20suggest%20that%2C%20in,COVID%2D19%2Drelated%20death.">70% effective</a> at preventing hospitalization and death, and if taken in the first five days of infection, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2118542">Paxlovid</a> or <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116846">remdesivir</a> are as much as 90% effective. Patients hospitalized in 2023 encounter a fine-tuned litany of antivirals and anti-inflammatory agents. We are at the lowest point in the pandemic for hospitalizations and deaths, and the average person </p>getting  being<p> infected with COVID now has mild symptoms. Many of the protections weve developed can help most at-risk people.</p><p>So, why are so many people still dying? And how do we reconcile those numbers with the vast improvements in our COVID tools?</p><p>This disparity points to a continued public health failure to take full advantage of these tools and to communicate the evolving risks in this phase of the pandemic. COVID never treated all groups equally, and some older people and immunocompromised individuals still face the highest risk of serious illness. But the calculus is nuanced, especially in light of treatment advances that should be used to protect more people.</p><p>To start, the immunosuppressed population is diverse. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8240867/">Most of these individuals</a>, including patients on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9381025/">immunosuppressive medications</a> such as corticosteroids and biologics, respond well to the COVID vaccines, which do offer them a strong layer of protection. Even for severely immunocompromised people  namely a fraction of those with malignancies or autoimmune disorders who take a drug that depletes their antibody response, as well as patients who recently got a transplant  vaccination is safe and effective when timed carefully around their treatment plans. If these higher-risk patients are hospitalized with COVID, early use of antivirals such as remdesivir with <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800275">plasma</a> and anti-inflammation therapy can help them recover.</p><p>Overall, the elderly population remains most vulnerable: Currently <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Week-Sex-and-Age/vsak-wrfu/data">more than 90% of COVID deaths</a> are of people 65 years and older. However, given that immunity (as measured by antibody response) wanes fastest in that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2023-02/slides-02-24/COVID-07-Britton-508.pdf">age group</a>, it is likely the unboosted who remain at highest risk, not the entire population. And research suggests that <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2802663">giving Paxlovid</a> to a greater number of eligible patients would reduce deaths. All of this makes clear that COVID does not have to be so dire for older individuals if we ensure that more are up to date on boosters and have access to the full range of therapies.</p><p>That points to two steps our political and public health leaders should take: First, more vigorously promote the recent bivalent boosters, especially to populations that need it the most. Only <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-pop65">43%</a> of those 65 and older, and 17% of Americans total, have received these boosters to date. Second, reduce barriers to Paxlovid and other early therapy use. This includes reeducating clinicians about the benefits and dispelling exaggerated fears about Paxlovid rebound (symptoms re-emerge after use of the medication for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/well/live/paxlovid-rebound.html">just a small percentage</a> of patients, and illness can return even for people who didnt take the drug). Providers should help patients, especially those at high risk, develop a Paxlovid plan so they know how to get it, what drug interactions to watch out for and any alternatives to Paxlovid they can take.</p><p>In addition, the federal government should continue to provide funding so that all communities including the uninsured have access to testing, vaccines and early therapy. Initiatives to keep improving our COVID arsenal, such as the $5-billion <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/newsroom/Pages/ProjectNextGen-May2023.aspx">Project NextGen</a> to promote development of vaccines and therapeutics, must be expanded.</p><p>Finally, public health leaders need to improve communications  both to combat misinformation and to make the public more aware of available resources. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still provides <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_new-admissions-rate-county">a map of COVID risk</a> for counties nationwide. During high levels of hospitalizations in their community, everyone should wear a well-fitting high-quality mask. Vulnerable populations should mask during medium levels and consider wearing masks in any crowded indoor areas or on public transit.</p><p>We all need to be sensitive to the needs and fears of those among us who are at risk of serious illness from COVID. We still have work to do  but theres less reason than ever that COVID should exist in parallel universes. Far more people could be getting protection and treatment.</p>Peter Chin-Hong is a professor of medicine and an infectious disease doctor specializing in immunocompromised patients at UC San Francisco. <p><a href="https://twitter.com/PCH_SF" target="_blank">@PCH_SF</a></p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

That group recommends children younger than 18 months should avoid screens other than video chats. It says parents of young children under 2 should choose "high-quality programming" with educational value and that can be watched with a parent to help kids understand what they're seeing.</p><p>Some groups said WHO's screen time guidelines failed to consider the potential benefits of digital media.</p><p>WHO's screen time advice "overly focuses on quantity of screen time and fails to consider the content and context of use," said Andrew Przybylski, director of research at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford. "Not all screen time is created equal."</p><p>Britain's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said the data available were too weak to allow its experts to set any thresholds for the appropriate level of screen time.</p><p>"Our research has shown that currently there is not strong enough evidence to support the setting of screen time limits," said Dr. Max Davie, the college's officer for health improvement. "The restricted screen time limits suggested by WHO do not seem proportionate to the potential harm," he said.</p><p>WHO did not specifically detail the potential harm caused by too much screen time, but said the guidelines  which also included recommendations for physical activity and sleep  were needed to address the increasing amount of sedentary behavior in the general population. It noted that physical inactivity is a leading risk factor for death and a contributor to the rise in obesity.</p><p>The agency said infants under 1 year old should spend at least half an hour every day on their stomachs and that older kids should get at least three hours of physical activity every day.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The groups members campaigned against the lifesaving smallpox vaccine in the late 1800s, a turbulent time when a nation grappling with the aftermath of slavery responded with <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/black-codes" target="_blank">black codes</a> and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/freedom-riders-jim-crow-laws/" target="_blank">Jim Crow laws</a> that pushed a divided society even further apart.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Vaccine resistance in America has frequently coincided with periods of great angst and resentment toward a government that seems bent on micromanaging citizens lives. As the country faces the largest outbreak of measles since the disease was deemed eliminated in 2000, epidemiologists and medical ethicists say they are not surprised to see an us-versus-them mentality fueling the rise of vaccine opponents once again.</p><p>This is a broader symptom of distrusting our institutions, said Richard Carpiano, a medical sociologist at UC Riverside.</p><p>Those who object to the measles vaccine arent just questioning the safety of the shot. Theyre challenging the states authority to require it.</p><p>Its no longer a lack of trust in the vaccine, but the vaccinator, <a href="https://www.uml.edu/fahss/philosophy/faculty/evans-nicholas.aspx" target="_blank">Nicholas Evans</a>, a bioethicist at University of Massachusetts Lowell.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e7/9e/f10c19e3b0a9f7cb00f236ba30f2/la-1556820808-vxmli2dfer-snap-image"></figure><p>At least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html" target="_blank">764 people in </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html" target="_blank">23 states</a> have contracted measles in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About half of those sickened have been children younger than 4.</p><p>An infection is never an individualistic affair. The virus that causes measles is more contagious than Ebola or Zika, and it remains suspended in the air for two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. To prevent a single case from ballooning into an outbreak, 90% to 95% of the population must be immunized.</p><p>Its that simple: The more that are vaccinated, the more people who will be saved, said <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/pages/aboutdeputydirector.aspx" target="_blank">Gil F. Chavez</a>, deputy director of the Center for Infectious Diseases at the California Department of Public Health.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/19/51/d0abcd5e803ed280607d406eaef3/la-1556821852-9fqk5cax5l-snap-image"></figure><p>There have always been pockets of vaccine resistance. But today they can be found on both ends of the political spectrum.</p><p>Theres the liberal I define whats healthy for me people, and the conservative the government cant tell me what to do view, said <a href="https://kennedyinstitute.georgetown.edu/people/daniel-sulmasy/" target="_blank">Dr. Daniel Sulmasy</a>, a bioethicist at Georgetown University. They come together in very American ways.</p><p>Perhaps no part of the country typifies the liberal objection to mandatory vaccines better than the Pacific Northwest, where hundreds of activists rallied at the Washington state Capitol with posters that proclaimed My child, my choice. Many parents with a strong commitment to abortion rights and an organic lifestyle believe a bout of measles, like chickenpox, is a time-honored childhood rite of passage.</p><p>About 2,800 miles and many ideological degrees away, ultra-Orthodox Jewish families in New Yorks Rockland County are <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/04-15-19-CF-et-al-v-CF-et-al-AFFIRMATION_2.pdf" target="_blank">citing individual autonomy and free exercise of religion</a> as reasons for refusing mandatory vaccinations. Despite 224<b> </b>measles cases and counting in that outbreak, the conservative community bristles at the governments attempt to interfere in their lives.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e4/92/42ca030a524faf0c279bd9e103ef/la-1556821551-v21d572sjj-snap-image"></figure><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/08/ca/9940b07dd86acf35f5c87a908d0a/la-1556820204-lymaq9kp5g-snap-image"></figure><p>Public health authorities have long restricted individual liberties for the sake of the common good. Smoking is prohibited in most public spaces. Tuberculosis patients who refuse medication <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/programs/TBLawPolicyHandbook.pdf" target="_blank">can be forcibly detained</a>.</p><p>That thinking holds for vaccines as well. In 1905, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against a father in Cambridge, Mass., who was fined $5 for refusing to have his son inoculated against smallpox. The courts <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/197us11" target="_blank">7-2 opinion</a> made clear that states have the authority to mandate vaccinations because society bears the cost when people opt out.</p><p>But anti-government sentiment tends to flourish when the fabric of society is frayed, as it is now. Civic discord undermines faith in public institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/9c/58/99172ec74faf1a3316d45dce2708/la-1556820065-l9wzga91v7-snap-image"></figure><p><a href="https://www.people-press.org/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2017/" target="_blank">Americans are now more polarized</a> in their views on a variety of core issues than theyve been in at least 25 years, according to the Pew Research Center. This tension helps explain why resistance to the measles vaccine is so strong.</p><p>Right now, we seem to be fighting about just about everything, said <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/elena-conis" target="_blank">Elena Conis</a>, a public health historian at UC Berkeley. Compulsory vaccination is no longer simply a medical act; its a political act.</p><p>This division provides fertile ground for activists. For example, a group called Parents Educating and Advocating for Childrens Health, or PEACH, has been working to influence Orthodox Jews with <a href="https://twitter.com/peachmoms?lang=en" target="_blank">conference calls</a> and <a href="https://issuu.com/peachmoms/docs/the_vaccine_safety_handbook_a4" target="_blank">handbooks</a> that accuse the government of exaggerating the benefits of vaccines while lying about the risks.</p> Tweet<p>On <a href="https://www.enrichedparenting.org/content/our-response" target="_blank">its website</a>, PEACH says it supports religious, philosophical, and medical choice, and that it isnt anti anything. But it does offer parents a <a href="https://www.enrichedparenting.org/sites/default/files/religious_exemption.pdf" target="_blank">simple form</a> to request vaccine exemptions, which drive down vaccination rates. In Rockland County, about 28<b>%</b> of children were unvaccinated as of earlier this year, according to state health officials.</p><p>The technique has worked before. After anti-vaccine activists visited a cluster of Somali immigrants in Minnesota, the number of children who received the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella dropped from 92% to 45% over a decade, according to states health department. A subsequent <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2017/measles082517.html" target="_blank">measles outbreak in 2017</a> sickened 79 people.</p><p><b><a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measles-us-california-outbreak-vaccine-new-york-disneyland/">How stricter vaccine laws spared California from a major measles outbreak </a></b></p><p>Other politically conservative regions of the United States are at risk. In Texas, the number of children with personal belief exemptions increased from 3,000 in 2003 to more than 56,000 in 2018. In Arizona, lawmakers have pushed back on vaccine enforcement legislation, including one who called it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TownsendForHouse/posts/10157162316113914" target="_blank">communist</a>.</p><p>Its the rise of individualism, said bioethicist <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/arthur-l-caplan" target="_blank">Arthur Caplan</a> of New York Universitys Langone Medical Center. Thats Trumpism  thats what the president represents.</p><p>Indeed, President Trump has <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/449525268529815552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E449525268529815552&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statnews.com%2F2019%2F04%2F23%2Fmeasles-vaccination-calls-rise-crickets-from-white-house%2F" target="_blank">endorsed</a> the discredited idea that the MMR vaccine causes autism. Before taking office, he held <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/30/donald-trump-vaccines-policy/" target="_blank">high-profile meetings with prominent anti-vaccine activists</a>.</p> Tweet<p>But as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html" target="_blank">number of measles cases passed 700</a>, the president revised his stance. The vaccinations are so important, he said on the White House lawn last week. Children have to get their shot.</p><p>Individualism also motivates those on the left whose aversion to authority is reminiscent of the turbulent 1960s and 70s, Evans said. They are asking the same questions about vaccines that feminists once asked about birth control pills: Are they necessary? Are they safe?</p><p>The sentiment is apparent in the school records of Clark County, Wash., the epicenter of an outbreak that sickened 71 people. Nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners began the 2017-18 school year without all their recommended shots, according to state health department data. After a bill to end philosophical exemptions to vaccines passed the state Senate in April, some residents vowed to move elsewhere if the measure became law.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/69/f4/582ed64edf3e56e57416149adb8b/la-1556819463-fj1wg6uthu-snap-image"></figure><p>Those anti-establishment attitudes are often grounded in the conviction that individuals know better than experts, who may be in the pockets of pharmaceutical companies and therefore discount the healing power of fresh air and exercise, Caplan said.</p><p>Youre going to hear, Nature wouldnt give us challenges we couldnt handle, which I find hilarious, because nature is trying to kill us about 80% of the time, he said.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0a/bf/5047c26a3337a4a93b702c4f4770/la-1556821077-fl0neeuub6-snap-image"></figure><p>Political and social upheaval have gone hand in hand with the most raucous spans of anti-vaccination culture  beginning with the era of the hymn about injecting poison into newborns.</p><p>After the Civil War, the federal government flexed its power over states to protect the rights of African Americans. When Reconstruction ended and that force was withdrawn, the backlash sparked a wave of individualism.</p><p>It was hardly an ideal climate for the doctors and drugmakers promoting smallpox vaccines in the early 1900s. Although the disease <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056803.htm" target="_blank">was killing about 1,500 Americans</a> each year, skeptical families didnt see a need for the shot. Outposts of the Anti-Vaccination Society of America and similarly named groups sprang up in several states, and their members helped <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1123944/" target="_blank">overturn mandatory vaccination laws</a> from California to West Virginia.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/94/41/8f8d46e66562a927da72df179fd2/la-1556822044-3s8f54fcci-snap-image"></figure><p>A fresh wave of resistance arose in the 1970s, fueled by the zeitgeist of the counterculture that encouraged Americans to question authority and traditional sources of expertise, Conis said.</p><p>The environmental movement taught people to be skeptical of the chemicals in their everyday lives, and advocates for reproductive rights encouraged women to exercise authority over their bodies rather than let lawmakers make decisions for them.</p><p>Women pushed back against patriarchy. Environmentalists pushed back against industry. Patients pushed back against doctors, Conis said. When you put those movements together, you get a skepticism on the left, which bubbles up and combines with the long-held anti-vaccination views of libertarians on the right.</p><p>The CDC missed its <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank">goal of eradicating measles in the U.S. by 1982</a>. Other failed attempts followed. Whenever political support went away, the cases tended to tick back up again, she said.</p><p>Health officials finally succeeded in 2000, but that victory is now in jeopardy. Experts fear measles outbreaks will continue until Americans return to the middle ground where facts are trusted and expertise is valued.</p><p>In a politically polarized country, Conis said, vaccination is as charged and divisive as any other issue.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/29/07/13460b3af722d28c879659acca9b/la-1556820598-7gvzmio6h5-snap-image"></figure>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

They've been welcomed into the highest government policy councils. They became fixtures on television news shows and were quoted </p> incessantly constantly <p>by some of the nation's leading newspapers.</p><p>They're </p> a <p>cadre of academics and scientists who pushed a discredited solution to the COVID pandemic, shunning masks, school closings, even vaccines, all in the name of reaching the elusive goal of "herd immunity," resulting in what may have been hundreds of thousands of unnecessary American deaths. </p><p>That's the contention of <a href="https://redhawkpublications.com/We-Want-Them-Infected-p547021769" target="_blank">"We Want Them Infected,"</a> a painstakingly documented new book by Jonathan Howard, a neurologist at New York University and a veteran debunker of the pseudoscience contaminating our efforts to fight the pandemic.</p> In 2019 you would have been considered a quack if you suggested that the best way to get rid of a virus is to spread the virus. But that became mainstream and influenced politicians at the highest levels.<p>Howard takes his title from Paul Alexander, an epidemiologist in the Health and Human Services Department during the Trump administration. </p><p>In July 2020, Alexander offered his view of <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000176-6c7e-d0c3-ab77-7dff0c950001" target="_blank">how to exploit the relative risks of COVID</a> to discrete populations to reach herd immunity. </p> The idea was that so many people would eventually become naturally infected with the virus, and therefore immune from further infection, that the virus would be unable to spread further<p>. </p><p>"Infants, kids, teens, young people, young adults, middle aged with no conditions etc. have zero to little risk," he told top HHS officials. "So we use them to develop herd ... we want them infected."</p><p>Alexander's proposal was essentially a screed against lockdowns. That suited the Trump White House, which was searching for ways around the economic dislocations caused by the virus. But he was wrong about the toll of sickness and death that would result, allowing the virus to rage among these ostensibly low-risk groups, and wrong about the prospects of reaching herd immunity naturally.</p><p>"We Want Them Infected" may be the most appalling and infuriating book you'll read about America's response to the pandemic. It's also essential reading.</p> The book is populated by quacks, mountebanks and charlatans  and not a few scholars with distinguished academic records  many of whom appear to have been seduced by the embrace of the right-wing echo chamber into promoting unproven and disproved policies. <p>"It's unbelievable that while doctors like myself were working to treat sick COVID patients, begging people to stay at home and be safe," Howard told me, "there was another group of doctors working at cross-currents to us  prominent doctors wanting to purposely infect unvaccinated young people with the promise that herd immunity would arrive in a couple of months."</p><p>They consistently minimized the gravity of the pandemic, but rarely if ever acknowledged that their optimistic forecasts of illness and deaths were consistently proved wrong. </p> There are a number of problems with the herd immunity theory. One is that immunity from COVID infection tends to wane over time rather than become permanent. Also, infection with one variant of the virus doesn't necessarily confer immunity from other variants, of which there have been many. Column: COVID boosted anti-vaccine propaganda. Now measles and other childhood diseases are on the march Another problem is that COVID can be a devastating disease for victims of any age. Allowing anyone to become infected can expose them to serious health problems.   Moreover, the prospect that COVID could be defeated by the natural expansion of herd immunity persuaded many people not to bother with proven countermeasures, including social distancing, masking and vaccination.  <p>Today, more than three years after COVID first appeared, the U.S. still has not achieved herd immunity </p> although it is nearing the goal, <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bob_wachter/status/1660819445059846144" target="_blank">     in the view of Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at UC San Francisco  </a>. The disease's trajectory has been cataclysmic  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/mortality-overview.htm" target="_blank">the U.S. death toll stands at 1.13 million</a>, hundreds of children have died, and an estimated <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/orphanhood_USA/" target="_blank">245,000 children have lost one or both parents</a> to COVID. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/" target="_blank">U.S. leads the world</a> in COVID deaths; its death rate of 3,478 per million population is worse than that of Britain, Spain, France, the Nordic countries, Canada and Israel.</p> Some herd immunity advocates<p> offered their blithe forecasts in a misguided, if not dishonest, attempt to provide comfort to the American public. Scott Atlas, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, urged HHS officials in March 2020 to advocate against lockdowns on grounds they were <a href="https://permanent.fdlp.gov/gpo190652/20220621TheTrumpAdministrationsEmbraceofaDangerousandDiscreditedHerdImmunityviaMassInfectionStrategy.pdf" target="_blank">"inciting irrational fear"</a> of the virus, which he estimated would cause about 10,000 deaths. "The panic needs to be stopped," Atlas wrote.</p><p>Atlas soon became a top advisor to Trump, promoting the herd immunity theory in the White House despite the objections of more experienced advisors such as Dr. Deborah Birx. </p> Howard is especially disturbed at how politicizing the pandemic has allowed fringe ideas to infiltrate public health policies. "In 2019 you would have been considered a quack if you suggested that the best way to get rid of a virus is to spread the virus," he says. "But that became mainstream and influenced politicians at the highest levels."<p>In his book, Howard reserves his deepest scorn for the promoters of the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank">"Great Barrington Declaration,"</a> a manifesto for herd immunity published in October 2020 and signed initially by epidemiologists Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford; Martin Kulldorff, then of Harvard; and Sunetra Gupta of Oxford. (Thousands of other academics and scientists would later add their signatures.) </p><p>The core of the declaration was opposition to lockdowns. Its solution was what its drafters called "focused protection," which meant allowing "those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk"  chiefly seniors.</p><p>Older people living at home, the declaration said, should be kept apart from other family members except by meeting them outside, and "should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home."</p><p>Focused protection, the promoters wrote, would allow society to achieve herd immunity and return to normalcy in <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank">three to six months</a>. </p><p>As Howard documents, the declaration was little more than a libertarian fantasy. That may not have been surprising, because one of its organizers was an arch-libertarian named Jeffrey Tucker. </p> Column: COVID boosted anti-vaccine propaganda. Now measles and other childhood diseases are on the march<p>For a taste of Tucker's worldview, consider a 2016 article entitled <a href="https://fee.org/articles/let-the-kids-work/" target="_blank">"Let the kids work."</a> There he ridiculed the Washington Post for publishing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-sight/wp/2016/10/31/20-haunting-portraits-of-child-laborers-in-1900s-america/" target="_blank">a photo gallery of child laborers</a> from 100 years ago, including miners and sweatshop workers as young as 10. </p><p>Tucker's response was that those children were "working in the adult world, surrounded by cool bustling things and new technology. They are on the streets, in the factories, in the mines, with adults and with peers, learning and doing. They are being valued for what they do, which is to say being valued as people.... Whatever else you want to say about this, its an exciting life." </p> A better life, at least, than "pushed by compulsion into government holding tanks for a full decade"  that is, going to school.<p>The declaration's promoters, Howard writes, never specified how to achieve their goals. Delivering food and supplies to millions of housebound seniors? In a Hoover Institution interview, Bhattacharya said, "We could have offered free DoorDash to older people." </p><p>As Howard observes, Bhattacharya was remarkably sanguine about "creating a program overnight to deliver fresh food to tens of millions of</p> senior  seniors<p> for months on end throughout the entire country."</p><p>Similar hand-waving addressed the problems of multigenerational households, in which millions of vulnerable elders live. Older family members, the declaration authors wrote, "might temporarily be able to live with an older friend or sibling, with whom they can self-isolate together during the height of community transmission. As a last resort, empty hotel rooms could be used for temporary housing."</p><p>Of course, hermetically sealing off tens of millions of "nonvulnerable" people from tens of millions of vulnerable people in a few weeks would be "the single greatest logistical challenge humanity had ever undertaken," Howard observes. "Nowhere in the world used focused protection to achieve herd immunity in three to six months, as the Great Barrington Declaration promised." </p><p>What the declaration really promoted was complacency. Its drafters, Howard says, were "people with no real-world responsibility for much of anything who </p> <p>made impossible things sound very easy. The task of actually getting food into the houses of elderly people was left up to public health authorities who were understaffed, overwhelmed and underfunded."</p> Column: Did Sweden beat the pandemic by refusing to lock down? No, its record is disastrous<p>What may be the most inexcusable element of the herd immunity movement was its implication that children could be used as shields for the rest of the population. Its advocates counseled against vaccinating young children on the grounds that their susceptibility to the virus was minimal or even nonexistent, so they could safely acquire immunity naturally  and perhaps, <a href="https://unherd.com/2022/02/should-we-let-children-catch-omicron/" target="_blank">as Vinay Prasad of UC San Francisco implied</a>, provide an immunity boost to adults in their families. </p><p>Yet although children tended to suffer less from symptoms when they were infected, they were anything but immune. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#SexAndAge" target="_blank">more than 1,600 American children</a> under the age of 18 have died from COVID during the pandemic.</p><p>In any case, death is not the only serious outcome from COVID. The CDC says more than <a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/covidnet/covid19_5.html" target="_blank">14,000 children were hospitalized</a> for COVID during the pandemic. An untold number of children may suffer from long COVID or other lifelong manifestations of the disease. For doctors to counsel deliberately exposing children to COVID when a vaccine is available, especially if the purpose is to protect adults, is "a moral abomination," Howard says. He's right.</p><p>In a world guided by science, the promoters of an unsuccessful herd immunity theory would long ago have lost their credibility and their public soapboxes. </p><p>The opposite has happened. Bhattacharya and Kulldorff still have their platforms (Kulldorff is now associated with the right-wing Hillsdale College). Both were appointed in December by Florida's anti-vaccine governor, Ron DeSantis, to a <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2022/12/13/governor-ron-desantis-petitions-florida-supreme-court-for-statewide-grand-jury-on-covid-19-vaccines-and-announces-creation-of-the-public-health-integrity-committee/" target="_blank">"Public Health Integrity Committee"</a> charged with questioning federal public health policies. </p><p>Scott Atlas, meanwhile, was tapped to deliver the commencement address at New College of Florida, a once-renowned liberal arts institution that DeSantis has turned into a haven for right-wing pedagogy. He was greeted with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/20/us/scott-atlas-new-college-florida-keynote-speech-boos/index.html" target="_blank">boos from the audience of graduating seniors</a>, however, indicating that the youth of America perhaps can't be gulled as easily as their parents.</p><p>At this moment, anti-science ideology on the right appears to be in the ascendance. Agitation against the COVID vaccine is </p>metastatizing  metastasizing <p>into an opposition movement against all childhood vaccinations, a trend that threatens to produce <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-11-30/the-anti-vax-movement-is-fostering-a-measles-epidemic">a surge in other vaccine-preventable diseases</a> such as measles and polio. </p><p>"The anti-vaccine movement has spotted an opportunity to sow doubt," Howard told me. "Getting rid of all school vaccine mandates has always been the Holy Grail for them." </p><p>Howard's book is a warning. We may be on the verge of a public health disaster, because the promoters of a failed theory that COVID could be fought through "natural immunity" without vaccines have been able to wrap themselves in the mantle of truth-tellers. But they're not.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/471734/year-three-americans-split-whether-pandemic.aspx">Gallup Poll</a> released in March found that 49% think the pandemic is over in the U.S.  the highest mark since Gallup started tracking that sentiment in the summer of 2021. And roughly <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-march-2023/">three-quarters of those surveyed</a> by <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/" target="_blank">KFF</a> that same month said they believe the public health emergencys end will either have a positive impact (27%) or "no impact" (46%) on the country overall. </p><p>Not everyone is welcoming Thursday's milestone. The doctors, scholars and public health advocates </p> who<p> call themselves <a href="https://peoplescdc.org/externalreview/" target="_blank">the Peoples CDC</a> say the real Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has abdicated its responsibility to protect the most vulnerable Americans and should be calling for continued masking in public indoor spaces, among other policies. These watchdogs want to see many of the pandemics strictures and financial supports remain in place until permanent steps have been taken to fix the racial and ethnic health inequities exposed by the global outbreak.</p> COVID-19 is fading. But ending the health emergency could leave us vulnerable<p>Asked when the public health emergency might defensibly end, <a href="https://fxb.harvard.edu/leadership-faculty-staff-fellows/lara-jirmanus/" target="_blank">Dr. Lara Jirmanus</a>, a Boston physician and a spokesperson for the Peoples CDC, cited the ongoing threat to the elderly, communities of color and those with compromised immune systems.</p><p>How about when they are as safe as they were before? she said. </p><p>So as we mark the end of an era, a sense of unease has been hard for many to shake. We get it: You have concerns. </p><p>After <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-01-25/in-new-york-citys-chinatown-residents-and-doctors-brace-for-coronaviruss-arrival">more than 1,200 days </a>of living with and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/topic/covid-19-pandemic">covering the pandemic</a>, we have perspective.</p>Im still afraid of dying from COVID-19<p>Youre not alone. But you are in diminishing company: That March Gallup Poll found that 3% of U.S. respondents remained very concerned about coming down with COVID-19, with an additional 22% calling themselves somewhat concerned.</p><p>Dying of COVID-19 is hardly impossible, but compared </p> with <p>the pandemics earliest days, its become pretty rare  especially if youve not yet reached middle age. </p><p>The CDC considers every hospital patient who tests positive for a coronavirus infection a "<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions">COVID-19 hospitalization</a>" even though many were admitted for other reasons. As a result, the agency's numbers suggest an overly grim picture of </p> the <p>country's health, said <a href="https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/physiciandirectory/shira-doron" target="_blank">Dr. Shira I. Doron</a>, an infectious disease specialist with Tufts Medicine.</p><p>"People who<b> </b>say it's still so terrible  I wish I could take them around the hospital and show them how fine we are," Doron said. "I wish I could show them how few COVID patients we have, how rare it is for someone to be in for COVID, or to die of COVID."</p><p>Her comments have been echoed by doctors across the country. </p><p>"It's clear the impact has decreased," said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jorge-salinas" target="_blank">Dr. Jorge Luis Salinas</a>, an infectious disease physician at Stanford. "We have no one with severe COVID at the hospital." </p> The CDC is changing the way it monitors COVID-19 in the U.S.<p>In the earliest days of the pandemic, studies of outbreaks in China, Italy and the United Kingdom and among passengers of the cruise ship <a href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/story/2020-02-05/coronavirus-cruise-passengers-diamond-princess">Diamond Princess</a> suggested COVID-19's case fatality rate  which measures deaths among those infected  was somewhere between 0.7% and 1.3%. <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/11/e043560" target="_blank">Later estimates</a> that tried to capture the toll across the world pegged the case fatality rate between 2% and 3%. </p><p>But COVID-19 was <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/" target="_blank">never an equal-opportunity killer</a>. While fewer than 0.002% of infected children under 10 died of COVID-19, the rate among infected people 80 and over was at least 8%.</p><p>Much has changed. The availability of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-01-10/israeli-data-shows-omicron-booster-kept-seniors-out-of-hospitals">vaccines to prevent severe illness</a>, and of <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/COVID-19/Treatments/Pages/Possible-Treatment-Options-for-COVID19.aspx#oral-antivirals">antiviral medications</a> that blunt a new infection, have whittled COVID-19s ability to kill. Medical professionals who are more experienced at treating the sickest patients have driven the case fatality rate down further. So has the protective effect of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-03-20/assessing-individual-mmunity-key-to-post-pandemic-future">immunity</a> gained by vaccines and past infections. The virus genetic evolution also appears to have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-08-12/scientists-question-whether-omicron-is-really-less-dangerous-than-other-coronaviruses">nudged it in a tamer </a>direction.</p> The more pandemic precautions fall away, the more COVID risk is concentrated on this one group<p>Its hard to suss out how each of these factors has affected the likelihood that, if infected, you would die. But <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36691933/">a large study</a> published in February suggested that by the time the Omicron variant had spread across the globe, its case fatality rate was 0.239%. </p><p>In short, by the time the pandemics third year came to a close, the virus that causes COVID-19 had lost roughly two-thirds of its initial killing power, and possibly as much as 92%.</p>But COVID-19 hasn't stopped killing people <p>No, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-04/covid-deaths-cut-nearly-in-half-but-disease-still-a-top-killer-in-u-s">it hasn't</a>. So lets look at who continues to be at greatest risk, and what you can do about it.</p><p>If you have the good fortune to have lived well into retirement age, then you have the bad luck of being most vulnerable to dying of COVID-19. Since mid-April, virtually all Americans who have succumbed to the disease have been at least 50, and the overwhelming majority have been over 75. </p> COVID deaths were cut nearly in half in 2022, but disease is still a top killer, especially in the South<p>The nations 1.2 million nursing home residents continue to bear the brunt of U.S. deaths. But even there, the situation has improved. According to a <a href="https://www.aarp.org/ppi/issues/caregiving/info-2020/nursing-home-covid-dashboard.html" target="_blank">nursing home dashboard</a> maintained by the <a href="https://www.aarp.org/ppi/about-ppi/">AARP Public Policy Institute</a> and the <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cas/academics/centers/scripps/">Scripps Gerontology Center</a> at Miami University in Ohio, there were roughly 6 deaths for every 10,000 nursing home residents in the month ending April 26. That's half the rate of 12 deaths per 10,000 residents seen in the first month of 2023.</p><p>You dont have any say in your age, but you do have a say in your vaccination status. The CDC <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status" target="_blank">calculated</a> that in February, adults in the U.S. who received an updated bivalent booster shot were six times less likely to die than people who remained unvaccinated (a group that still represents about one-fifth of the U.S. population). They were also 1.4 times less likely to die than vaccinated people who hadn't gotten the bivalent booster (and thats about 80% of the adult population).</p><p>So if you're 65 or older and its been at least four months since your last jab</p> ,<p> the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0419-covid-vaccines.html" target="_blank">recommends</a> you <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-04-18/extra-spring-covid-booster-cleared-for-certain-americans">go ahead and get another</a>.</p> CDC greenlights spring COVID booster for some. Do you need it? I<p>f you are medically fragile or at least 50 years old, you can reduce your chance of dying if infected by taking an antiviral within five days of your first symptoms. <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-11-14/for-some-covid-patients-paxlovid-rebound-has-nothing-to-do-with-paxlovid">Paxlovid</a> reduces the average likelihood of hospitalization or death by about 90%, and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-11-30/merck-covid-pill-fda-panel-review">molnupiravir</a> reduces it by 31%.</p><p>That means you need to remain attentive to how you are feeling and seek out a prescription if you have some combination of the<a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-10-25/your-coviod-symptoms-may-depend-on-your-vaccination-status"> key symptoms of COVID-19</a> in the Omicron age: sore throat, runny nose, congestion, persistent cough and headache.</p>Ive heard that every time I get COVID-19, my chances of dying go up<p>Thats the apparent takeaway from a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02051-3" target="_blank">study</a> that compared 44,000 U.S. veterans who had suffered multiple coronavirus infections with nearly 444,000 whod only had one infection and 5.3 million others whod never tested positive.</p><p>Compared </p> with <p>people who'd been infected once, those who had been reinfected were twice as likely to die, three times as likely to be hospitalized, and three times more likely to experience heart problems or blood clotting over the following six months.</p> How many COVID deaths are 'acceptable'? Answer is key to moving to a post-pandemic world<p>That sounds scary, but experts caution that veterans cared for in </p> Veterans Affairs <p>hospitals hardly represent an average population. Ninety percent of them were men, and only 12% were younger than </p> 39<p>. The study didnt account for which coronavirus variant caused each infection. And both infected and reinfected people were identified by the VA's COVID-19 testing system, meaning any infected vet who was doing fine went uncounted by researchers.</p><p>Theres another problem with the findings:</p>  T<p>hey don't make immunological sense, said Doron of Tufts Medicine.</p><p>Subsequent infections are less severe, she said. In healthy people, the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-01-19/how-the-bodys-immune-system-tries-to-fight-off-covid-19">immune system's</a> first look at the virus (either the real thing or a synthetic version from a vaccine) prompts a complex and multilayered defensive response. Even after antibodies  among the first lines of defense  begin to fade, T cells can fight back against a reinfection, making it milder and often shorter than the previous bout.</p> How immune are we? Why answering this question is essential for post-pandemic life<p>Still, as the authors of the study put it, reinfection is not benign; it is best to avoid it.</p><p>If youre still reading, odds are you already believe that. But you should also know that, given the Omicron variants <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-12-23/what-is-it-about-the-omicron-variant-that-makes-it-spread-so-easily">prodigious transmissibility</a>, reinfection will be nearly impossible to prevent.</p><p>That may not be a bad thing. Virologists have long predicted that over time, virtually all of us will build up the kind of immunity we have to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.</p>I'm worried that my mask won't protect me if no one else is wearing one <p>Few issues have been more contentious than the value of face coverings. First, health authorities advised, we didnt need them (because medical professionals needed them more). Then we did (because they appeared capable of reducing viral spread). Now we're told they're not even necessary in hospitals? What gives?</p><p>Today, the CDC says that given <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e1.htm?s_cid=mm7133e1_w">the nations high levels</a> of vaccine- and infection-induced immunity and the availability of effective prevention tools and treatments, universal masking is unnecessary in most public settings, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html">including healthcare settings</a>. In schools, the CDC recommends that children should wear a mask if they need extra protection from COVID-19.</p><p>That may come as a surprise, but the fact is we just have too much data at the population level that masking doesnt change the course of the pandemic, said <a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/monica-gandhi" target="_blank">Dr. Monica Gandhi</a>, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Francisco. </p><p>An <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub6/full?s=08">exhaustive review</a> of studies that tested the protective value of masks against the coronavirus as well as several strains of flu left researchers uncertain whether wearing masks or N95/P2 respirators helps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses.</p><p>Even in healthcare settings, where infection was widespread, there was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-04-06/masking-up-in-hospitals-didnt-stop-covid-spread-during-omicron-era-without-other-precautions-uk-study-finds">limited evidence</a> that universal masking offered much value given the current status of the outbreak. And an influential group of doctors whose job is to stem the spread of diseases in hospitals recently called for an <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M23-0793" target="_blank">end to universal masking in healthcare settings</a>. </p> Without other pandemic precautions, hospital mask rules didn't stop COVID spread, study finds<p>Those doctors made clear that under different circumstances, universal masking was a critical protective measure. In future pandemics or significant localized outbreaks, the practice could be justified again, they wrote. But when the expected benefits of such policies are low, they added, its a policy whose time has come and gone ... for now.</p><p>Then they said out loud what many have thought but kept to themselves: that masking impedes communication, that face coverings obscure facial expression and make listening harder, that they contribute to feelings of isolation; and negatively impact human connection, trust, and perception of empathy.</p>I dont want to go to public spaces or socialize with others for fear of catching COVID-19<p>Again, youre not alone. In late March, 23% of Americans <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/471734/year-three-americans-split-whether-pandemic.aspx" target="_blank">told pollsters</a> they had avoided large crowds to protect themselves over the </p> l<p>ast week. In addition, 18% had stayed away from planes, buses, subways or trains, and 14% had avoided going to public places. One in 10 had shunned even small gatherings. </p><p>But consider this: Your social life matters to your health  a lot. People who are socially isolated are <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-loneliness-heart-risk-smoking-20160419-story.html">more likely</a> to suffer a stroke or heart attack, not to mention depression, cognitive impairment and an earlier death. Social isolation makes normal  and fixable  impairments like hearing loss less evident. And unchecked health problems become bigger and sometimes different problems. Hearing loss is a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-dementia-predictors-20170717-story.html">risk factor for dementia</a>. </p><p>These are trade-offs you really should consider before giving up on your book club or your mah-jongg group, or discouraging your friends and family from dropping in.</p>&nbsp;Im afraid of getting long COVID<p>Sufferers of long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of COVID, are a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-03-25/covid-long-term-side-effects-frustrate-patients-scientists">large and mystifying group</a>. </p><p>Lingering problems with heart, kidney and lung function are common among people who were hospitalized with severe COVID-19. But not all long COVID sufferers were very ill. Even people with mild or asymptomatic infections have experienced problems for months afterwards, ranging from brain fog and exhaustion to heart palpitations, depression and an inability to exercise.</p><p>Since June 2022, the CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau have been conducting the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/household-pulse-survey.html" target="_blank">Household Pulse Survey</a> to gauge Americans' experiences during the pandemic. So far, the survey has found that 28.4% of all adults with a confirmed coronavirus infection suffered lingering symptoms lasting three months or more.</p> USC researchers identify symptoms associated with increased risk for long COVID<p>But theres growing evidence that most cases of long COVID resolve themselves after a few months, and that new cases of long COVID are <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-01-12/even-after-mild-cases-of-covid-long-covid-symptoms-can-linger-for-more-than-a-year">becoming less common</a>. In the most recent Household Pulse Survey, only 11.2% of U.S. adults said they were currently experiencing long COVID symptoms.</p><p>That long COVID is more unusual in the Omicron era is suggested by a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciad143/7076063" target="_blank">study</a> published in March. In a group of 1,201 healthcare workers from nine Swiss healthcare networks, those whod been infected with the original version of the coronavirus were 67% more likely to report symptoms of long COVID than those who were not infected. However, healthcare workers who were infected with the Omicron variant were no more likely to report long COVID symptoms than those whod never been infected.</p><p>It's not clear whether these nurses and doctors were protected by COVID-19 vaccines or by Omicrons gentler ways. But <a href="https://www.kssg.ch/aerzte/dr-carol-strahm" target="_blank">Dr. Carol Strahm</a>, an infectious disease doctor who co-wrote the study, leans heavily toward the latter explanation. As long as the Omicron variant dominates, </p> he<p> said, our results should provide reassurance that people are now unlikely to develop long COVID.</p><p>Stanford's Salinas noted that mysterious and prolonged symptoms after a viral infection have always existed. Only because the pandemic virus infected so many people in so short a time has the phenomenon come under close scrutiny.</p><p>The prospect of suffering post-infective syndrome after a bout of flu or a cold sore doesnt send people into a protective bubble, he added. At this point in the pandemic, neither should fear of long COVID</p> , he said<p>. </p> I recognize that people are suffering from long COVID and that its very real, Salinas said. But at a personal level I dont navigate the world or conduct my life based on fear of long COVID.   Im afraid tests, vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 will become really expensive   This is one of those end-of-pandemic problems that <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-02-14/what-happens-to-covid-vaccines-drugs-authorized-for-emergency-use-when-health-emergency-ends">     will unfold over time  </a></p> , but which should be largely manageable for now. The end of the public health emergency means that the cost of testing for coronavirus infections will shift for many Americans. At-home tests will be available in drugstores, but at $12 to $15 apiece, theyll be an expensive first step for people worried about their symptoms. The more reliable and time-consuming PCR tests will be subject to insurers rules and copays. For people with health insurance, vaccine boosters and antiviral medications will remain available, though they may come with a copay. What happens to COVID vaccines and drugs authorized for emergency use when health emergency ends? In April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/04/18/fact-sheet-hhs-announces-hhs-bridge-access-program-covid-19-vaccines-treatments-maintain-access-covid-19-care-uninsured.html" target="_blank">     announced  </a></p>  a $1.1-billion bridge program designed to preserve access to COVID-19 vaccines and medications for uninsured Americans. Whether its a bridge to anywhere lasting remains to be seen: The Biden administration has sought to create a <p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2024-budget-in-brief.pdf" target="_blank">     Vaccines for Adults  </a></p>  to plug current holes in vaccine access for uninsured adults, but its bogged down in budgetary scuffles. In the interim, the bridge program will ensure COVID-19 care at commercial pharmacies and federally funded health centers that serve low-income communities, and through local public health organizations. The same program will also hold some drug manufacturers to their public commitments to provide vaccines and treatments free of charge for the uninsured.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The World Health Organization <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/who-ends-pandemic-emergency-covid-19-deaths-fall" target="_blank">declared the coronavirus</a> emergency was over globally the week before, and earlier this year California <a href="https://www.chhs.ca.gov/end-of-covid-emergency/" target="_blank">ended its pandemic state of emergency</a>.</p><p>But make no mistake: The emergency response may have ended, but </p> COVID-19 is still with u<p>s</p>the pandemic itself is not over<p>. The virus that has officially <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">killed about 7 million people</a> worldwide (and very likely many more unofficially), and <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank">more than 1.1 million people</a> in the United States, is still sickening thousands every day. People are still dying. Millions are still suffering from the loss of loved ones, opportunities and finances. A new, more infectious Omicron subvariant, Arcturus, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-28/as-arcturus-grows-coronavirus-in-l-a-county-sewage-rises">is circulating in Los Angeles</a>, along with a brand</p> -<p>new symptom: pink eye.</p> arrived in Los Angeles<p>Now we are shifting into the</p> pandemic's <p><b> </b>next phase, in which we manage the waves of infection that are likely to continue for the foreseeable future, while seeking new medications and therapies to reduce transmission, treat infection and help the many people still suffering from infections </p> they contracted <p>months, even years earlier. </p><p>It's not certain how many people have the condition known as long COVID, though health experts estimate it may be in the millions. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm" target="_blank">nearly one-fifth</a> of Americans who had COVID over the previous two years were still experiencing symptoms, which include fever, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction and heart palpitations.</p><p>Most troubling, <a href="https://covid19.nih.gov/news-and-stories/symptoms-long-covid-differ-people-different-racial-and-ethnic-groups">research by the National Institutes of Health</a> has found disparities in the diagnosis of long COVID. Latino and Black people are more likely to develop long-term symptoms after the initial infection, but are less likely to be properly diagnosed. These are communities </p> that <p>already experienced a high rate of COVID-related deaths and economic fallout from pandemic measures, and continue to lack proper access to medical treatment. It's unacceptable that they should continue to suffer disproportionately.</p><p>It's frustrating that policymakers haven't taken the step</p> s<p> necessary to prepare for the next public health emergency, which include taking an inventory of the ways the nation stumbled (early testing snafus, lack of supplies and little federal/state coordination of resources, just to name a few) so that we can put better systems in place. </p><p>Yes, </p> drug companies <p>were able to develop vaccines in less than a year after the pandemic began, but we can't count on that happening with every new infectious disease. But it seems as if lawmakers want to forget the terrible times. A bipartisan bill that would have created a 9/11-style commission to review state and federal responses <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-senators-revive-bid-to-form-covid-19-commission-d15c5fc4" target="_blank">remains stalled</a> in Congress.</p><p>That's a shame, because scientists tell us that humanity may face another deadly pandemic much sooner than the century between </p>COVID and <p>the 1918 influenza pandemic </p> and COVID<p>. As the emergency ends, the nation's health and political leaders must not let go of the urgency to build a stronger public health response for the next public health crisis.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

But it will lash together a raft of new and existing tools to keep an eye on the virus while also keeping broader tabs on the public's health.</p><p>With the federal government's three-year-old public health emergency set to expire next Thursday,</p>5/11<p> the agency will begin to track COVID-19 cases alongside other respiratory illnesses, said <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/pdd.html" target="_blank">Dr. Nirav D. Shah</a>, the CDC's </p> principal <p>deputy director. New cases of the pandemic virus, which has caused <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_totaldeaths_select_00" target="_blank">1.1 million</a> deaths in the United States and <a href="https://covid19.who.int/" target="_blank">6.9 million</a> deaths worldwide, will eventually be lumped together with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm">influenza</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/index.html">respiratory syncytial virus</a> and other infections that can cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pneumonia/index.html">pneumonia</a> and death in humans.</p><p>The CDC will still be able to alert communities to upticks in coronavirus spread based on its continued tracking of emergency department visits, COVID-19 hospitalizations and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-21/sewage-surveillance-covid-infectious-diseases-future">wastewater surveillance</a> from local sewage plants. Reliable statistics on COVID-19 deaths will lag behind other data. </p> COVID deaths were cut nearly in half in 2022, but disease is still a top killer, especially in the South<p>Shah said the CDC's plan will yield a picture of the pandemic virus that is "superior" to the data it gathers on flu and RSV. However, the agency's website will no longer offer detailed insights on local conditions that many Americans had come to rely on. And the data that will be posted will be collected and updated less frequently. </p><p>"CDC will continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and provide the information to which we have access," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the agency's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-05/cdcs-rochelle-walensky-resigns-citing-pandemic-transition">outgoing director</a>, <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/hearings/preparing-for-the-next-public-health-emergency-reauthorizing-the-pandemic-and-all-hazards-preparedness-act">told members</a> of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Thursday. "We have worked hard to sustain the data to understand whats happening with the virus in America. But the end of the [public health emergency] means the CDC will no longer be able to collect data and share information many Americans have come to expect."</p><p>For instance, the CDC's color-coded <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=CommunityLevels">COVID-19 community risk maps</a>, which have provided county-level assessments of coronavirus spread, and of local hospitals capacity to care for infected patients, will be discontinued, Shah said. </p><p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-02-25/cdc-eases-pandemic-covid-19-indoor-mask-guidelines">Adopted in February 2022</a>, the CDC's COVID-19 Community Level maps relied heavily on Americans' willingness to get tested at labs and clinics, which in turn reported numbers and rates of new infections to the agency. But milder infections have prompted less testing and at-home testing has become the norm  trends that have dried up the CDC's sources of reliable localized data. </p><p>Indeed, in recent months, experts have concluded that the CDC's count of new cases is no longer a reliable measure of the coronavirus' spread. </p> COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency, World Health Organization says<p>At the same time, many states and counties have stopped gathering or reporting COVID-19 data altogether. That has added to the difficulty of maintaining and updating local risk maps and of documenting health disparities based on race and ethnicity, Walensky said.</p><p>The CDC will also lose some insight into the demographics of people seeking vaccines. Most, though not all, states and territories have pledged to continue to share the age, gender and ethnicity of people being vaccinated for COVID-19. But those details will no longer be updated regularly on the CDC website. </p><p>"We will make do," Walensky said on Capitol Hill. "However, this should worry us all, primarily because what it says about the visibility we will have into the next outbreak. We will be back to square one."</p><p>To monitor the virus that causes COVID-19, the CDC will rely on an established network of healthcare systems and public health departments across the country that already help the agency monitor respiratory and other illnesses. They will supply real-time data on patients being treated for COVID-19 and other flu-like illnesses, and the CDC will comb through death certificates for information about COVID-19 fatalities. </p><p>Surveillance networks such as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/resp-net/dashboard.html" target="_blank">RESP-NET</a>, meanwhile, will continue to collect lab data on respiratory viruses from regions that cover more than 29 million people in 13 states. A second system of 450 labs across the nation will provide the CDC with data on viruses that cause respiratory ailments. </p> What happens to COVID vaccines and drugs authorized for emergency use when health emergency ends?<p>Over the past two years, the agency has recruited and trained a growing cadre of partners  local health departments, wastewater treatment plant managers and private and academic labs  to help it detect, sample and measure concentrations of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage. Shah said that new network will continue to assess the water we flush down our toilets and send down our drains to provide early warning of worrisome trends.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/wastewater-surveillance.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnwss%2Fwastewater-surveillance%2Findex.html" target="_blank">Wastewater surveillance</a> can provide highly local evidence that infections have ticked upward, even if the people shedding the virus have not been diagnosed. The data </p>is are <p>especially useful if </p>it's<p> followed by a hike in COVID-19 hospitalizations, and </p>it  they<p> can be combined to paint a national picture of the rise and fall of infections.

She sent a resignation letter to President Biden and announced the decision at a CDC staff meeting.</p><p>Walensky, 54, has been the agencys director for a little over two years. In her letter to Biden, she expressed mixed feelings about the decision and didnt say exactly why she was stepping down, but said the nation is at a moment of transition as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-05-05/who-downgrades-covid-pandemic-says-its-no-longer-emergency">emergency declarations come to an end</a>. I have never been prouder of anything I have done in my professional career, she wrote.</p><p>The World Health Organization said Friday that COVID-19 no longer qualifies as a global emergency, and the U.S. public health emergency declaration will expire next week. <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00">Deaths in the U.S.</a> are at their lowest point since the earliest days of the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.</p> COVID-19 is no longer a global emergency, World Health Organization says<p>The CDC, with a $12-billion budget and more than 12,000 employees, is an Atlanta-based federal agency tasked with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats.</p><p>Walensky, previously an infectious diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, had no experience running a government health agency when she was sworn in on the first day of the Biden administration.</p><p>She came with a reputation as a prominent voice on the pandemic, sometimes criticizing certain aspects of how the government was responding. She was brought in to raise morale at the CDC, to rebuild public trust in the agency and to improve its sometimes-bumbling response to the pandemic.</p><p>At the time of her arrival, more than 400,000 U.S. COVID-19 deaths had been reported, and states were scrambling to get supplies of new vaccines. Morale at the CDC was abysmal. The Trump administration had marginalized the agency, with the White House taking over the governments messaging about the pandemic and sometimes opposing or undermining what the CDC wanted to do.</p> The CDC is changing the way it monitors COVID-19 in the U.S.<p>No CDC director in history inherited the set of challenges she faced coming into the job, said Jason Schwartz, a health policy expert at the Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>The CDC regained prominence in government messaging  although even under Biden, the White House remained at center stage in the handling of the response, Schwartz said.</p><p>Walensky leaves at a time when the U.S. COVID-19 death toll stands at about 1.1 million. Reported cases, hospitalizations and deaths have all been trending down for months.</p> At CDC, Walensky started a center for forecasting and outbreak analytics and took steps to modernize data collection and analysis. Last year, she <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-08-20/as-global-health-threats-evolved-the-cdc-didnt">began a reorganization</a></p>  designed to make the agency more nimble and to improve its communications with the public. As global health threats evolved, the CDC didn't Biden, in a statement, said Walensky leaves CDC a stronger institution, better positioned to confront health threats and protect Americans. White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients applauded her performance. Her creativity, skill and expertise, and pure grit were essential to our effective response and an historic recovery that made life better for Americans across the country, Zients, formerly Biden's COVID response coordinator, said in a statement. There were <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cf09f8a3d28915ac314ea97dd4a52c3b">     stumbles during her tenure  </a></p>  too.<p>In the spring of 2021, Walensky said fully vaccinated people could stop wearing masks in many settings, only to reverse course as the then-new Delta variant spread. And that December, the agencys decision to shorten isolation and quarantine caught many by surprise and caused confusion.</p> Free at-home COVID tests end May 11 for some. Here's how to stock up Also, Walensky and other U.S. officials were criticized last year for not being aggressive enough against an emerging mpox outbreak that <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeypox-health-medication-public-313a2781a28f6b17230843432a609118">     faded in the late summer and fall  </a></p> . Jennifer Nuzzo, a pandemic expert at the Brown University School of Public Health, is worried that the proposed reforms wont happen without Walensky there to drive them. CDC is exhausted. They have been working around the clock, nonstop, for three years with little gratitude, she said. To have a leadership change in the midst of all that ... I can't imagine that doesn't take the wind out of the sails of change.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

He bemoaned the damage that COVID-19 had done to the global community, saying the virus had shattered businesses and plunged millions into poverty.</p><p>COVID has changed our world and it has changed us, he said, warning that the risk of new variants still remained.</p><p>When the United Nations health agency first declared the coronavirus to be an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-japan-france-south-korea-virus-outbreak-0f0f07b30c8cdd2b0f30c6081acc7599">international crisis</a> on Jan. 30, 2020, it hadnt yet been named COVID-19 and there were no major outbreaks beyond China.</p><p>More than three years later, the virus has caused an estimated 764 million cases globally and about 5 billion people have received at least one dose of vaccine.</p><p>In the U.S., the public health emergency declaration made regarding COVID-19 is set to expire Thursday, when wide-ranging measures to support the pandemic response, including vaccine mandates, will end. Many other countries, including Germany, France and Britain, dropped many of their provisions against the pandemic last year.</p><p>When Tedros declared COVID-19 to be an emergency in 2020, he said his greatest fear was the virus potential to spread in countries with weak health systems he described as ill-prepared.</p><p>In fact, some of the countries that suffered the worst COVID-19 death tolls were previously judged to be the best-prepared for a pandemic, including the U.S. and Britain. According to WHO data, the number of deaths reported in Africa accounts for just 3% of the global total.</p><p>The WHO made its decision to lower its highest level of alert Friday, a day after convening an expert group. The U.N. agency doesnt declare pandemics, but first used the term to describe the outbreak in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-michael-pence-religion-travel-virus-outbreak-52e12ca90c55b6e0c398d134a2cc286e">March 2020</a>, when the virus had spread to every continent except Antarctica, long after many other scientists had said a pandemic was already underway.</p><p>The WHO is the only agency mandated to coordinate the worlds response to acute health threats, but the organization faltered repeatedly as the coronavirus unfolded. In January 2020, the WHO publicly applauded China for its supposed speedy and transparent response, even though recordings of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-health-ap-top-news-virus-outbreak-public-health-3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae">private meetings obtained by the Associated Press</a> showed top officials were frustrated at the countrys lack of cooperation.</p><p>The WHO also recommended against members of the public wearing masks to protect against COVID-19 for months, a mistake many health officials say cost lives.</p><p>Numerous scientists also slammed WHOs reluctance to acknowledge that COVID-19 was frequently spread in the air and by people without symptoms, criticizing the agencys lack of strong guidance to prevent such exposure.</p><p>Tedros was a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-geneva-5670593f4f3fd55113a9dea64b4bdc9d">vociferous critic</a> of rich countries that hoarded the limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, warning that the world was on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure by failing to share shots with poor countries.</p><p>Most recently, the WHO has been struggling to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, a challenging scientific endeavor that has also become politically fraught.</p><p>After a weeks-long visit to China, the WHO released a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/who-report-animals-source-covid-19-coronavirus-8a839c179c330c56fa46a763b7286a7f">report</a> in 2021 concluding that COVID-19 most likely jumped into humans from animals, dismissing the possibility that it originated in a lab as extremely unlikely.</p><p>But the U.N. agency backtracked the following year, saying that key pieces of data were still missing and that it was premature to rule out that COVID-19 might have ties to a lab.</p><p>A panel commissioned by the WHO to review its performance criticized China and other countries for not moving quicker to stop the virus and said the agency was constrained by its limited finances and inability to compel countries to act.</p>Maria Cheng reported from London.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Weve gone from the 2021 peak of an estimated 3,000 Americans dying daily from the infection to about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/04/16/covid-deaths-per-day/">250 a day now</a>. But this normal still includes more than 30,000 <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">COVID-19 deaths</a> since the beginning of 2023, and the virus remains a leading cause of fatality in the U.S. This is not acceptable.</p><p>We face confusing realities: The pandemics acute phase is over, but COVID remains a significant cause of death. New variants always loom, one of the latest being XBB.1.16  nicknamed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/health/xbb-1-16-variant-of-interest/index.html">Arcturus by some on social media</a>  which recently <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-04-20/new-covid-subvariant-arcturus-now-in-l-a">reached L.A</a>. Any long-term approach to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 will require periodic boosters  yet as of March, fewer than 1 in 5 eligible Americans got the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/21/health/second-round-bivalent-boosters-covid-19/index.html">booster</a> that was made available in September, suggesting that interest in the shots has dipped alongside the virus toll.</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-changes-simplify-use-bivalent-mrna-covid-19-vaccines">recently amended</a> its authorizations for Pfizer and Modernas mRNA vaccines, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to modify its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Wading through these changes offers a window into our next stage of confronting COVID: adapting as vaccine technology evolves, emphasizing protections for high-risk people and maintaining vaccination as a preventive measure.</p><p>The newest available mRNA vaccine is the bivalent shot, which contains two strains of the virus instead of the single strain in the original monovalent version. The FDA discontinued use of the monovalent vaccine because in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2215471">agencys assessment and analysis of independent data</a>, the bivalent shot provides better protection than the monovalent vaccine. </p><p>As a result, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0419-covid-vaccines.html">CDC now recommends</a> that everyone get at least one dose of the bivalent vaccine whether or not theyve already had one or more doses of the monovalent vaccine (which is no longer allowed in the U.S.). However, the agency currently says that among adults, only higher-risk people  specifically those age 65 or older and immunocompromised individuals  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0419-covid-vaccines.html">should be allowed</a> to receive additional bivalent vaccine doses. For children younger than 6, multiple doses are still recommended, but the appropriate number varies by a childs age and vaccine history.</p><p>These nuanced recommendations make sense right now. They simplify the vaccine schedule for most people at a time when the U.S. has widespread <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-03-03/the-u-s-avoided-a-massive-winter-covid-19-surge-how">population immunity</a>, so focusing on high-priority groups over the general population is an efficient use of public health resources. </p><p>People with weak immune systems require additional vaccine doses to achieve the same level of protection as others. Older individuals remain at much higher risk of death and hospitalization compared with younger ones, meaning that ensuring high vaccination rates for those age 65 or older will be essential to reduce deaths, hospitalizations and other dire outcomes such as long COVID. And it is reasonable to protect children under 6 years old with multiple vaccine doses rather than multiple exposures  which is the other way to shore up immunity, but comes with the risk of severe illness.</p><p>But the current moment isnt guaranteed to last. Group-level protection could diminish, especially as immunity wanes or if a new variant emerges that can better evade existing immunity. Infection rates can surge quickly, meaning public health recommendations  and their communication to the public  have to be nimble. Guidance to maintain high vaccination rates among <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-02-09/covid-emergency-biden-healthcare-worker-shortage">health workers</a>, for example, will mitigate the impact of a sudden increase in COVID-19 transmission on the health system.</p><p>And we should be prepared to keep adjusting to newer, better vaccines. The Biden administration recently announced it will accelerate development of the next generation of COVID vaccines and treatments under the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-spending-5-billion-speed-up-development-new-covid-vaccines-2023-04-10/">$5-billion-plus Project Next Gen.</a> Thats a worthy aim. </p><p>The benefits of the bivalent vaccines continue to outweigh their risks in all groups, and they remain very useful in reducing severe disease and death. But theyre far less effective in lowering overall infections from the Omicron family of viruses. They also require boosters to offer the most protection, and theyre continuously at risk of being tripped up by new, more lethal or more transmittable variants. Substantial investment in vaccines that block infection and, ideally, that work irrespective of the variant is the only path to sustainable control of COVID-19.</p><p>We are living with this virus now. We have to rely on forward-looking, science-based vaccine policies to help us control its continuing impact.</p>Saad B.

The government is also beginning the process of lifting shot requirements for Head Start educators, healthcare workers, and noncitizens at U.S. land borders. </p><p>The requirements are among the last vestiges of some of the more coercive measures taken by the federal government to promote vaccination as the deadly virus raged, and their end marks the latest display of how President </p>Joe<p> Biden's administration is moving to treat COVID-19 as a routine, endemic illness. </p><p>While I believe that these vaccine mandates had a tremendous beneficial impact, we are now at a point where we think that it makes a lot of sense to pull these requirements down, White House COVID-19 coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told the Associated Press on Monday.</p><p>Deeply polarizing at the time and the subject of numerous legal challenges  many of which were successful  the vaccination requirements were imposed by Biden in successive waves </p>in late 2022<p> as the nations vaccination rate plateaued even amid the emergence of new, more transmissible variants of </p> the coronavirus.COVID-19. No, COVID vaccines aren't being added to our food supply<p>More than 100 million people at one time were covered by Biden's sweeping mandates, which he announced on Sept. 9, 2021, as the Delta variant of the virus was sickening more people than at any time up to that point in the pandemic. Biden had ruled out such requirements before taking office that January, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-business-health-6e758dc5e24320677e48f58cbfca37bf">came to embrace them</a> to change the behavior of what he viewed to be a stubborn slice of the public that refused to be inoculated, saying they jeopardized the lives of others and the nations economic recovery.</p><p>Weve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us, Biden said at the time. The unvaccinated minority can cause a lot of damage, and they are.</p><p>Federal courts and Congress have already rolled back Biden's vaccine requirements for large employers and military servicemembers. </p><p>Mandates remain for many employees of the National Institutes of Health, Indian Health Service and Department of Veterans Affairs  which implemented their own requirements for healthcare staff and others independent of the White House  </p>will remain<p> while those agencies review their own requirements, the administration said.</p>Over <p>More than 1.13 million people in the U.S. have died of COVID-19 since the pandemic began more than three years ago, including 1,052 people in the week ending April 26, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the lowest weekly death toll from the virus since March 2020.</p><p>COVID continues to be a problem, Jha said. But our healthcare system or public health resources are far more able to respond to the threat that COVID poses to our country and do so in a way that does not cause problems with access to care for Americans.</p><p>He added, Some of these emergency powers are just not necessary in the same way anymore.</p> Arcturus, a more infectious COVID subvariant, grows in L.A. County, seen in sewage <p>More than 270 million people in the U.S., or just over 81% of the population, have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>For more than a year, U.S. health officials have been eyeing a long-term response to COVID-19 that is more similar to the approach to influenza, with updated shots yearly targeted at the latest strains of the virus  particularly for the most vulnerable. But fewer than 56 million people in the U.S., or 17% of the population, have received a dose of the updated bivalent boosters that became available in September 2022 and provide better protection against the Omicron variants that remain in circulation. </p><p>"We dont have a national mandate for flu vaccines in the same way, and yet we see pretty good uptake of flu vaccines," Jha said. The goal here really is to continue to encourage people to get vaccinated, but I dont think mandates are going to be necessary for getting Americans vaccinated against COVID in the future.</p><p>While federal mandates are ending, Jha predicted that some employers, especially medical facilities, may decide to maintain their COVID-19 vaccination requirements. He noted that the hospital where he practices has had a flu vaccine requirement for employees for 20 years. </p><p>Jha dismissed concerns that the ending of the international traveler vaccination requirement would increase the risk of a new variant from overseas entering the U.S. Biden has already rolled back virus testing requirements for both American citizens and foreign travelers to the U.S.</p><p>Jha said the U.S. was already protected by a traveler genomic surveillance program, which, for instance, tests for different virus strains in aircraft wastewater.</p><p>We think that we are much more able to identify if a new variant shows up in the United States and respond effectively, he said. And I think thats what makes the need for a vaccine mandate for travelers less necessary right now.</p> Opinion: Will you need the latest COVID booster?

It comprised an estimated 10% of U.S. cases for the week that ended Saturday; the prior week, it was about 6%; and the week before that, it was 3%.</p><p>The California Department of Public Health <a href="https://calcat.covid19.ca.gov/cacovidmodels/" target="_blank">estimates</a> Arcturus comprises about 7% of coronavirus cases for the same week. At least three Arcturus cases have been identified in L.A. County, the </p>Dpartmentof Public Health  agency<p> said </p> Thursday<p>.</p><p>It's too early to say whether Arcturus is associated with a greater rate of pinkeye than older coronavirus variants. </p><p>But the </p>Department of Public Health health agency <p>said people "should be aware that itchy, watery or red eyes may be a sign of COVID-19 infection, and these symptoms should not simply be dismissed as a result of pollen or seasonal allergies, especially if someone more vulnerable to severe illness could be exposed."</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/vipintukur/status/1644026879740084225?s=20">Pinkeye</a>, also known as conjunctivitis, can lead to eye damage if </p>left<p> untreated. Officials urge people to use at-home coronavirus tests to determine whether they are infected.</p><p>The increase in wastewater levels in L.A. County may be an early indication of increased spread of the coronavirus, health officials said, although reported cases are still relatively stable, as are hospitalizations and deaths. For the most recent week, there were 54 <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/los-angeles-county/">COVID-19 deaths</a> reported in Los Angeles County. There were 44 deaths reported the prior week, and the week before that, 59. </p><p>Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said that because Arcturus is related to recent strains of the coronavirus, it is expected that vaccines and anti-COVID therapeutic drugs such as <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-03-16/covid-19-pill-paxlovid-moves-closer-to-full-fda-approval">Paxlovid</a> will still be quite effective against severe illness and death.</p><p>"Although we are facing the reality of a new Omicron strain gaining dominance and it is not yet possible to predict the impact, I am confident that the tools available to us  including vaccines, therapeutics and testing  can limit bad outcomes," Ferrer said in a statement </p> Thursday<p>.</p><p>That said, it remains important that people get the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-03/updated-covid-19-boosters-give-significant-additional-protection">updated COVID-19 vaccination</a>. Only about 40% of L.A. County seniors 65 and older have received the updated COVID-19 vaccination, which was introduced in September.</p><p>COVID-19 remains a significant cause </p>for<p> of death, even as the intensity of the pandemic has dropped considerably. In 2022, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in Los Angeles County, behind coronary heart disease and Alzheimer's disease, according to a preliminary data analysis by the Department of Public Health.</p><p>The rest of the <a href="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/59/15/d93ea40841bf8c063ab51f05f7d8/lac-leading-causes-of-death-rankings-2019-2022-04-26-202358.pdf" target="_blank">leading causes of death</a> in L.A. County last year were stroke, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, unintentional drug overdose, hypertension and pneumonia/flu. </p><p>However, COVID-19's third-place ranking represents an improvement since 2021, when the illness was the leading cause of death. In 2020, COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death, trailing coronary heart disease.</p><p>Those results demonstrate how the risk of COVID-19 to the general population has declined. Vaccinations became plentiful by mid-2021, and anti-COVID therapeutic drugs by mid-2022. </p><p>About 260,000 <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank">COVID-19 deaths</a> were reported nationally in 2022. There were about 472,000 deaths in 2021, and about 355,000 deaths in 2020. More than 40,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported nationally this year. </p><p>Older people who are unvaccinated or not up to date on their vaccinations are the most likely to die from COVID-19. </p><p>Although some health experts are wearing masks less often, given lower coronavirus transmission levels, they say they still try to take reasonable steps to avoid infection. Reducing the risk of infection is especially important if you're older, in a higher risk group or have an underlying health condition.</p><p>If you get a coronavirus infection, "you still have to isolate for five days, so it's kind of a bummer," said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert.</p><p>That said, Chin-Hong said he no longer has a problem <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-29/what-new-years-activities-are-safe-as-omicron-spreads">dining at indoor restaurants</a>.</p><p>"And probably the only times I might wear my mask is in the hospital setting," and perhaps on an airplane, he said, noting that </p> he <p>donned a mask on a recent flight where he was near a group of passengers who came back from Europe "and they were all hacking and coughing, and none of them were wearing masks."</p><p>State epidemiologist Dr. Erica Pan said in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y40TylQWPLI&amp;t=184s" target="_blank">briefing</a> that if she sees increases in COVID-19, she'll probably still test her family before </p>she has<p> they have an indoor meal with her parents.</p><p>And in an interview last week, Ferrer said that while she is now more likely to eat in an indoor restaurant than before, she'd want to do it in a well-ventilated place that isn't crowded. She said she feels comfortable going to sporting events and concerts, although she might have her mask on if it's very crowded or she's inside. </p><p>"I, like others, have activities that I enjoy and people I enjoy being with. And I want to, as much as possible, find ways to do that," Ferrer said. "I'm in one of those categories of folks that are at higher risk. So I want to be reasonable about this and, where possible, reduce risks, but get on with being able to do a lot of the things I really love to do."</p><p>With widespread access to updated vaccines and anti-COVID therapeutics, "what I think is different right now is we have a lot more protection," Ferrer said. "So we need to balance reducing our risk with not remaining too isolated from the people or the activities we love."</p><p>Deciding what risks to take is a personal choice, she said. </p><p>"None of us should be judgmental," Ferrer said. </p> "It's still important for people at higher risk to reduce risk in reasonable ways, wherever they see that it would be appropriate." Springtime is when coronavirus cases have generally been low.  That "means that your chances of bumping into somebody who is positive with COVID-19 is reduced," Ferrer said. "And if you go to a restaurant inside that's well-ventilated, that's not super-crowded, your chances of having an exposure are certainly a lot less than they are when our transmission rates are higher." To control spread, it's important to test, especially if you have symptoms. <p>When <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-01-30/president-biden-to-end-covid-19-emergencies-on-may-11">the national public health emergency</a> ends on May 11, the federal requirement that health insurers reimburse policyholders for eight over-the-counter rapid COVID tests per month will also go away.</p><p>But even after May 11, many Californians will still have access to tests, whose costs must be reimbursed by their insurer. Thanks to <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB510" target="_blank">SB 510</a> and <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB1473" target="_blank">SB 1473</a>, </p> each person insured<p> under health plans regulated by the state Department of Managed Health Care will still be required to cover the costs </p> of <p>eight over-the-counter rapid tests a month. This includes health coverage many get from their employers, as well as Medi-Cal-managed plans and Covered California plans. </p><p>Starting Nov. 11, insurers regulated by the state Department of Managed Health Care still must cover COVID tests if they're provided in-network, but can charge for tests purchased out-of-network. </p><p><a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidtests/how/" target="_blank">Free at-home tests</a> also are available at a number of sites in L.A. County, including county libraries, vaccination sites run by the county Department of Public Health and food banks and senior centers. L.A.

The updated booster was first introduced last September.</p><p>This new phase of the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-28/covid-vaccine-anniversary-california-helen-cordova">years-old vaccination campaign</a> has been hotly anticipated in some circles  particularly given that shot-induced protection <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-02-11/study-covid-booster-effectiveness-wanes-but-remains-strong">wanes over time</a> and many higher-risk individuals are months removed from their last dose.</p><p>However, the next chapter also arrives as the pandemic has stabilized. As the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health <a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;ou=ph&amp;prog=media&amp;cur=cur&amp;prid=4354&amp;row=25&amp;start=1">noted recently</a>, "Although transmission is still occurring, there is low concern for rapid spread of the virus." </p><p>But COVID-19 remains a danger, even though the darker days of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-11-23/central-california-pleading-to-send-covid-19-patients-to-l-a-as-hospital-fill-up">overwhelmed hospitals</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-01/la-me-covid-19-death-toll-morgue-funeral-homes">overflowing morgues</a> appear to be over. More than 72,000 people in the U.S. have died from COVID-19 since early October  nearly four times the estimated death toll from flu over the same time period. </p><p>"COVID-19 continues to be a very real risk for many people, and we encourage individuals to consider staying current with vaccination, including with a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine," U.S. Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-changes-simplify-use-bivalent-mrna-covid-19-vaccines">in a statement</a>.</p><p>Here's what you need to know:</p>Who can get another booster? <p>Those who are at least 65 years old can get another dose, according to the CDC. Immunocompromised individuals are eligible too.</p> According to language the FDA unveiled    Tuesday  ,<p> people 65 and older may receive one additional dose of the updated booster at least four months following their initial updated booster dose.</p><p>The agency also said that most immunocompromised<b>&nbsp;</b>people may receive an additional booster dose at least two months following their first updated booster dose. Such individuals, the FDA said, can also receive additional future doses at the discretion of their healthcare providers.</p>Should older people get it?<p>The CDC said it is recommending allowing the additional updated booster shot, which will "allow more flexibility for people at higher risk who want the option of added protection from additional COVID-19 doses." In other words, seniors and immunocompromised people who are eager for the additional booster are free to get it, but the CDC is not necessarily urging those groups to get the shot with the same urgency as it did for most people last year.</p> Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the CDC has been pretty clear that for most healthy people under age 65 who have already received the updated booster, youve got really decent protection.  But I think for those people over 65, those people who are immunocompromised, it may be helpful to go ahead and get that second bivalent booster dose, Ferrer said.  Another factor to consider: having plans to travel, which exposes people to more risk of infection. <p>Some </p> doctors <p>suggest older patients get the additional booster. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, said, "The older you are, the more important it is."</p><p>"The bottom line is I would advise them to get it if you're older than 65," he said. "We know that antibodies wane at the three- to four-month mark [after a shot], and they wane the most in those who are older than 65." </p>What about everyone else? <p>Aside from the above groups, most people who have already gotten the updated bivalent booster are not eligible for another dose. However, those who haven't </p> gotten the first shot<p> are free to roll up their sleeves. </p><p>The CDC recommended that everyone 6 and older get the updated COVID-19 shot  regardless of whether they had completed their primary vaccination series. That means if you haven't gotten a COVID-19 booster since September, or if you are unvaccinated, the CDC is recommending you get the updated vaccination now. </p><p>"For young children, multiple doses will continue to be recommended and vary by age, vaccine and which vaccines were previously received," the CDC said. </p><p>Wednesday's action means that people who are getting vaccinated for the first time need only one shot of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna doses to be considered up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations. Officials said they are ending the original two-dose monovalent regimens </p> of those vaccine brands<p>, </p> which were designed against the ancestral version of the coronavirus and are now considered outdated.<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html" target="_blank">Existing CDC recommendations</a></p>  on use of the monovalent vaccinations made by Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson remain in place. <p>On Tuesday, the FDA authorized the following updated vaccine regimens for children younger than 6:</p> Unvaccinated children 6 months to 5 years can get a two-dose series of the Moderna bivalent vaccine, or, for children 6 months through 4 years, three doses of the offering from Pfizer-BioNTech. Children who are 5   can get two doses of Moderna or one Pfizer-BioNTech shot.  Children up to 5 who have been fully or partially vaccinated also can get a bivalent booster, "but the number of doses that they receive will depend on the vaccine and their vaccination history," according to the FDA.How can I get a booster? <p>Eligible Californians will be able to schedule an appointment either directly through their healthcare provider or by using the state's online platform: <a href="https://myturn.ca.gov/">MyTurn.ca.gov</a>.</p>Is there any cost? <p>Vaccines remain free even after recent moves to lift COVID-19 emergency declarations at both the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-02/covid-emergency-is-ending-what-does-that-mean">state and federal levels</a>. </p>Why should I get a booster?  Evidence has accumulated that those who have gotten the updated booster <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-11-22/us-renews-push-for-covid-boosters-as-data-show-they-protect">are better protected</a></p>  against hospitalization and death, Ferrer said. The benefit is particularly pronounced among older individuals. <p>"Available data continue to demonstrate that vaccines prevent the most serious outcomes of COVID-19, which are severe illness, hospitalization and death," Marks said.</p> COVID-19 has remained the leading infectious cause of death in L.A. County, and can be especially dangerous for older people who aren't up-to-date on their vaccinations and boosters, even if they've been previously infected and recovered. For the most recent weekly period available, 59 <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/california-coronavirus-cases-tracking-outbreak/los-angeles-county/">     COVID-19 deaths were reported  </a></p>  countywide.<p>According to a recent analysis, among seniors age 65 to 79 in L.A. County, those who got the updated booster had one-tenth the risk of being hospitalized compared with those who are unvaccinated, and roughly half the risk of being hospitalized compared with those who are vaccinated but havent received the bivalent booster.</p><p>Among this age group, those who got the updated booster were about one-tenth as likely to die from COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated people  and roughly half as likely to die compared with vaccinated people who hadnt received the updated booster.</p> While no single health intervention provides absolute protection against infection, experts say getting vaccinated provides some benefit in that regard. That could prove useful given the emergence of another <p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-04-14/cdc-adds-new-xbb-1-16-omicron-subvariant-to-variant-tracker" target="_blank">     coronavirus Omicron subvariant, XBB.1.16  </a></p> , which some experts say could plausibly lead to another bump in cases in the coming months. There are anecdotes from India suggesting this particular strain is behind a number of reports of "COVID eye"  also known as pink eye or conjunctivitis  especially among children.  Still, the latest subvariant has not been associated with increased risk of severe illness.   What is a bivalent vaccine?   The bivalent shots are updated versions of the original COVID-19 vaccine shots that first became widely <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-22/when-should-i-get-the-new-covid-booster">     available in September  </a></p> .  Regardless of the brand, the bivalent booster is formulated to protect against the hyperinfectious family of Omicron coronavirus subvariants that have dominated the nation for <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-20/omicron-sweeps-across-nation-now-73-of-us-covid-19-cases">     more than a year  </a></p> .  They were designed with BA.4 and BA.5 in mind, as those sibling subvariants rose to prominence last <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-12/omicron-ba5-coronavirus">     spring and summer  </a></p> . But officials say they continue to work well against strains that <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-13/california-tops-12-million-covid-cases-xbb15-now-dominant">     have subsequently emerged  </a></p> , such as XBB and <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-13/california-tops-12-million-covid-cases-xbb15-now-dominant">     XBB.1.5  </a></p> . The original formulations of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were designed against only the ancestral version of the coronavirus, rather than the heavily mutated versions in circulation today.  "At this stage of the pandemic, data support simplifying the use of the authorized mRNA bivalent COVID-19 vaccines, and the agency believes that this approach will help encourage future vaccination," Marks said.   What will demand be like?   Don't expect anything like the early days of the vaccine rollout  when <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-07/cal-state-la-vaccination-site-offering-vaccines-for-all-adults-friday-through-sunday">     people braved lengthy lines  </a></p>  or <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-07/bakersfield-covid-19-vaccine-hunters-los-angeles">     hit the road  </a></p>  in desperate search for shots. According to the California Department of Public Health, only about one-fourth of eligible residents <p><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccination-progress-data/">     have gotten a  </a></p>  bivalent booster in the seven months since it became available.  However, that number belies regional disparities that have endured throughout the vaccine campaign. A recent Times data analysis found that as of the end of March, nearly 35% of eligible residents in the San Francisco Bay Area had gotten the bivalent booster, compared with 23% in Southern California and only 16% in the San Joaquin Valley.  Some health officials have also expressed concern with the relatively low uptake among seniors. Statewide, just under 46% of those 65 and older who have been vaccinated have also gotten a bivalent booster. In <p><a href="http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm" target="_blank">     L.A. County  </a></p> , the share is 42%. In a recent statement to The Times, officials at the California Department of Public Health said they support federal recommendations "for everyone to receive bivalent boosters, especially those who are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 due to older age or medical conditions, who remain at increased risk of hospitalization or death if not boosted." "The level of acceptance of future vaccine doses remains to be seen," the statement continued. "CDPH remains concerned that Californians who have not received recommended doses now or in the future will suffer unnecessarily from severe COVID-19 <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-10/fatigue-cough-and-brain-fog-for-some-in-los-angeles-county-long-covid-limited-daily-life">     or long COVID  </a></p> ."                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Find ideas and inspiration  foron where to go, what to eat and how to enjoy life on the weekends.<p>While Bill Nye is a man of many truths  he's a martini guy, a model train guy and a wife guy  he's best known by the masses as </p>T t<p>he Science Guy. That's fine by him. Because in 2023, 30 years after </p> "<p>Bill Nye the Science Guy</p> "<p> first aired on PBS, the bow-tie-clad educator is still sharing the message that we need science, maybe now more urgently than ever.</p><p>His 2017 Netflix show, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80117748">Bill Nye Saves the World</a></p>,<p> tackled climate change, vaccinations and diets. More recently, he's the host of Peacocks <a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch-online/-/the-end-is-nye/7809083229421999112">The End Is Nye</a>, </p> in whichwhere<p> he takes viewers through realistic yet nightmarish scenarios, like a supervolcano eruption </p> orand<p> a worldwide blackout. </p><p>The allure is in the unsettling plausibility </p>i o<p>f it all. "You might think that when there's a pandemic, people would want to watch romantic comedies or something," Nye said. "But no, people watch disaster movies. They rent 'Contagion.'"</p><p>Nye said the goal of the show, which he co-created with Brannon Braga and Seth MacFarlane, is to scare people into paying attention. While the first half of each episode lays out the disaster, the second half is about resolving it with science.</p><p>When Nye isnt teaching viewers how to save the planet, he rides his bike, eats oysters and contemplates the universe with his wife, Liza Mundy. Here's how he'd spend the perfect day in L.A. </p><p><b>8 a.m.: Have coffee in bed</b></p><p>First of all, I turn on the coffee. I use the expression "turn on" because I make the coffee in the coffee maker the night before and turn it on when I get up. And this is possible because  product placement  I use a <a href="https://us.moccamaster.com/">Technivorm Moccamaster</a>. Then I bring coffee to my wife in bed. For those of you men out there, bring the woman a cup of coffee. I'm telling you, it's a hit with women of all ages, 60 years old to 106 years old. I'm just saying, those are data [points] I've collected.</p><p><b>9 a.m.: Head to the farmers market</b></p><p>We go to the <b>Studio City Farmers Market</b></p> ,<p> and the three things we always buy are some croissants from <a href="https://www.frogsorganicbakery.com/"><b>Frogs Organic Bakery</b></a>, some flowers from various vendors and some fish from this one vendor who claims all the fish is sustainably caught. And we often buy oysters on Sundays  we'll get a half</p> -<p>dozen oysters</p> ,<p> and we'll have three apiece later in the day.</p><p><b>10 a.m.: Make scones </b></p><p>I lived in Seattle for many years, and there's a scone mix made by <a href="https://fisherscones.com/">Fisher</a>. I get no kickback from this, but if they want to pay me, I'm on board, man. So Fisher's scone mix is a short</p> cakebread<p>. You don't do anything but add water. And then you get these lovely, warm</p> ,<p> yummy scones from the oven. And then we almost always will have a soft</p> -<p>boiled egg with the scone.</p><p><b>10:30 a.m.: Watch our favorite news show</b></p><p>We always watch Meet the Press, which we recorded, because I don't need all the drugs that are advertised during Meet the Press.</p><p><b>11:30 a.m.: Do some chores </b></p><p>Most Sundays I sweep the front walk. I have a very nice tree in the front yard that provides a lot of shade. It's very good, it's a camphor tree. But it sheds these little berries, especially this time of year, so I keep a broom by the front door with a Rubbermaid hold-it-on-the-wall thing, and I sweep the front walk.</p> If I could get to the point where I felt my desk was cleaned off, or the workbench was cleaned off, or there was nothing wrong with all my freaking irrigation system stuff, that'd be really good. <b>Noon</b><p><b>12 p.m.: Go for a bike ride</b></p><p>Noon or noon-thirty, Ill ride a bike. I used to be very good on a bike</p> .,<p> I used to be quite strong. Now I'm of a certain age, but I have five bikes.</p><p>I don't do it every Sunday, but more than four times a year, I'll take stuff to </p>E e<p>-waste</p> ,<p> and then on the way back, I'll stop at M</p>oun<p>t. Sinai </p>C c<p>emetery and visit the grave of my neighbor who became a dear friend. When I moved in here 17 years ago, she was in her 80s. She would turn on the oven, and I would make scones and take them over to her house and bake them in her oven</p> ,<p> and then we'd sit around and talk about the universe or what have you. </p><p><b>2 p.m.: Visit the toy train store </b></p><p>Sometimes Ill take trips to the <a href="https://www.trainshack.com/"><b>Train Shack</b></a>. In the living room right now, I have a toy train set up. I ran it earlier today, blew the whistle and the horn. The smoke comes out of the engine, the giraffe ducks its head as it goes under the whole thing. It just fills me with joy. </p> And my wife is an enabler in this. I gotta say, she doesn't discourage the toy train thing in any way. It's not for everyone, but going into the Train Shack   ,  seeing Todd and Mindy and Chris and getting a new chimney for your Christmas caboose  that's a good activity.<p><b>4 p.m.: Take a walk with Liza</b></p><p>We almost always go for a walk that's about five miles up the hill here in Studio City to a lookout point.</p>  There's a street that has a good view of the  v   V alley, so we walk up there and back down. <p>We'll say hi to a few neighbors.</p><p>Bob Picardo, a dear friend of ours, was the officiant at our wedding. And he said, "You know, if you've been around them, they're always talking. They're just always talking." Liza and I just talk all the time. And he pointed out to the audience, "Many of their conversations are interesting, but let's face it, everyone. A lot of their conversations are just dumb." And so one of the questions that Liza and I ask each other several times a day is this: "Is what we're talking about dumb?" But it's been agreed that if it's about food, then it's inherently not dumb. It's an inherently worthy conversation. If it's about oyster knives, that could be a half</p> -<p>hour right there.</p><p><b>5:45 p.m.: Shuck oysters and have martinis on the front porch</b></p><p>I'll put one of my oyster plates in the freezer while I shuck the oysters from the farmers market. The oyster guy will have given us a small bag of chipped ice. When I'm ready to go, I'll take that plate out of the freezer, put the chipped ice on it, then put the oysters on there.</p><p>Then we'll make a martini. Now I, as you may know, prefer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNcqO26HbeW/" target="_blank">Bombay Sapphire gin</a>. Liza prefers Hendrick's, so we alternate. And then in the summer, or when it gets warm, rather, we both like to have Barr Hill gin, which has a little honey in it. So we sit on the front porch with a martini and oysters. That's really a fantastic Sunday.</p><p>If we're not on the porch  like, it was pouring down rain a few weeks ago  we'll sit in the living room, sipping the drinks and having the toy train run in the background.</p><p><b>7 p.m.: Fire up the grill for dinner</b></p><p>And if it's like last Sunday, we'll have swordfish. I cook them on a grill. Now in the modern world, you don't have to guess if the swordfish is done. I have the electronic temperature probe  it's a Weber </p>g G<p>rills product. It Bluetooth-ifies into your phone, so you wait until it's the perfect temperature</p> ,<p> and then you take it off and it cooks those last couple degrees Celsius. I do it in metric units, by the way. </p><p><b>8:30 p.m.: Catch up on Ted Lasso</b></p><p>What we'll do now is watch "Ted Lasso" from a few days ago. There's no gunplay, there's no slashing, there's no blood. Something we hope to try, and we haven't really pulled it off, is watch two episodes  watching last week's again, and then this week</p> 's<p>  but we haven't been able to do that. So it seems indulgent.</p><p><b>9 p.m.: Read a bit before bed</b></p><p>Liza is an avid reader. I'm a reader, but she is ... look out, people. So we'll read and then turn off the lights after a while.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

"And I was like, 'Well, shoot, I'm going to post this crazy thing because I have no idea what it is.'"<p>Someone in Facebook's comments section </p>then<p> tagged Wayne Thompson, a paleontologist at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History. He identified the object as a molar belonging to a <a href="https://www.westernsciencecenter.org/introducing-the-pacific-mastodon">Pacific mastodon</a></p>,<p> an elephant-like mammal that existed between 5,000 and 10,000 years ago, during the Ice Age.<b> </b></p><p>"This is an extremely important find," Thompson wrote Schuh. "Give me a call when you get a chance.</p><p>The Santa Cruz museum </p> recently added<p> the artifact to its collection  one of only three known specimens found in the area, Thompson said.</p><p>When this tooth was fossilized, sea levels were 300 feet lower than they are today. Elephants and mammoths could walk out to the Channel Islands, Thompson said. Its another piece of evidence that we have for climate change.</p> Almost 40% of land burned by western wildfires can be traced to carbon emissions<p>Liz Broughton, the visitor experience manager at the Santa Cruz museum, thinks the devastating winter storm that hit Santa Cruz in </p> January<p><b> </b>may have washed the mastodon tooth onshore. </p><p>Storms are known to uncover paleontological finds, but Thompson said this is the first time its happened in their region.</p><p>But acquiring the mastodon tooth was not easy. After he saw the Facebook post, Thompson raced to the beach on Friday</p> to collect the tooth<p>, but </p>when he got there it  the tooth <p>was gone.</p><p>We were on pins and needles, he said.</p><p>On Saturday, Thompson <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Csydb6PLIec/">went on Instagram</a> to ask if anyone knew </p>about<p> the tooths whereabouts, and if they did, to call the museum. <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/california/mastodon-mystery-in-santa-cruz-county-ice-age-tooth-vanishes-from-beach/">KRON 4</a> first reported about the missing tooth on Sunday.</p><p>It was like a social media news blitz, just putting everything out to try to find out who might have taken the tooth, Thompson said.</p><p>Two days later, the museum received a call from an unnamed </p>individual person <p>from Aptos who had picked up the tooth on the beach during a jog. He saw the news coverage of the missing molar, realized what the artifact he had found was and turned it in.</p><p>Its really a testament to our community and the trust they have in us to care for objects like this, Broughton said.</p> Bones, sweat and years: What it takes to dig up a dinosaur<p>This isnt the first time the museum has encountered remains of a mastodon. In 1980, 16-year-old Jim Stanton <a href="https://www.santacruzmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023_Mastodon-Tooth-Press-Release.pdf">found a mastodon skull in the same creek</a> at Rio Del Mar State Beach, Broughton said. Thompson excavated the skull and spent years repairing it for display.</p><p>The skull and a tooth belonging to a young mastodon are </p>among the specimens<p> on permanent exhibit at the museum. The newly discovered molar will be studied and is expected to also be put on display.</p> We all have studied history, but the minute you see something from the past that you can actually hold in your hands  it gives me goosebumps now just thinking about it," Schuh said. <p>Based on the wear and tear of the tooth, museum staff estimates the mastodon was between 30 and 40 years old when it died in a nearby river valley.</p><p>Thompson said the Santa Cruz museum might install a temporary exhibit to display the molar. Longer-term, staff are hoping to put together an exhibit about the extinct elephants that lived in the county.</p><p>Any fossil we find helps to better fill in the gaps in our knowledge and paint a picture of what life looked like here in the past, Broughton said. The potential for the scientific value from this specimen is very high.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

We found that these four hospital networks alone have invested at least $4.6 billion in fossil fuels and estimate that privately owned U.S. hospitals have well over $10 billion invested in the fossil fuel economy.</p><p>Kaiser Permanente, for example, has $80.2 million invested in Suncor Energy, among the worlds <a href="https://www.ran.org/list-tar-sands-companies/" target="_blank">largest producers</a> of environmentally destructive tar sands oil, which <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/news/carbon-emissions-factor-into-oil-sands-shakeup-21341">produces at least 17% more carbon pollution</a> than conventional crude oil. The Mayo Clinic, often called Americas best hospital, has over $40 million invested directly in fossil fuel production giants, including Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips.</p><p>I believe hospitals deliver enormous benefits to their communities, and I know they have a financial responsibility to their pensioners and investors. But they are making a big mistake  for their balance sheets and their patients health  by investing in fossil fuels.</p><p>To start with, these investments are a bad bet financially. Despite a temporary surge in prices after Russias invasion of Ukraine, <a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/two-economies-collide-competition-conflict-and-financial-case-fossil-fuel-divestment" target="_blank">long-term analyses of the stock market</a> make clear that the economic prospects of the fossil fuel industry are grim. The industry has been unable to deny that the economic shift to <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/13/war-and-subsidies-have-turbocharged-the-green-transition">renewable energy</a> has begun. The value of fossil fuel companies is poised for a crash as the world gets serious about limiting the use of oil, coal and natural gas. It is just a question of when.</p><p>But even more important is the role these investments play in climate change, of which fossil fuel companies are both the biggest driver and the biggest obstacles to solutions. These companies have <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/How-Big-Oil-Continues-to-Oppose-the-Paris-Agreement-38212275958aa21196dae3b76220bddc" target="_blank">spent billions</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/08/oil-companies-climate-crisis-pr-spending" target="_blank">lobbying</a> the government to slow climate action and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/exxon-climate-change-global-warming-research" target="_blank">lied for decades</a> about climate science and about their plans to stop polluting.</p><p>In that time, climate change has become a health crisis. The <a href="https://nam.edu/programs/climate-change-and-human-health/" target="_blank">National Academy of Medicine calls</a> it one of the most significant threats to human health in the 21st century.</p><p>Health impacts from global warming and the continued burning of fossil fuels <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/key-findings" target="_blank">already claim 13 million lives annually</a> from environmental factors including air pollution, disease and extreme weather events like Californias devastating wildfires. Scientists warn that continuing the status quo could lead to temperatures <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf" target="_blank">rising by more than 4 degrees Celsius</a> (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit), resulting in cataclysmic levels of mass starvation and death. Thats the future these hospitals are currently investing in, even though they will be on the front lines of dealing with the consequences.</p><p>These kinds of adverse health impacts are what motivated the health industrys last major divestment push, against tobacco in the 1980s and 90s. The industrys leadership led to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596576/" target="_blank">Big Tobacco companies</a> losing much of their political clout in Washington.</p><p>Drawing on that model, university students launched a fossil fuel movement a decade ago that has grown into a powerful arm of the climate movement. Some 1,590 institutions have committed to forms of <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">fossil fuel divestment</a>, totaling a staggering $40.5 trillion of assets under management. It has <a href="https://www.divestinvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Divest-Invest-Program-FINAL10-26_B.pdf">expanded</a> beyond university campuses to include local governments, foundations, banks and investment firms. Since 2021 alone, <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">institutions</a> such as Harvard University, the cities of <a href="https://www.pionline.com/esg/new-law-requires-baltimore-pension-funds-divest-fossil-fuels">Baltimore</a> and <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2022/3/21/22989875/chicago-ordinance-fossil-fuel-divestment-conyears-irvin-city-funds-council-committee-vote">Chicago</a>, and the <a href="https://divestmentdatabase.org/">Ford and MacArthur foundations</a> have committed to divestment, citing a clash between fossil fuel extraction and their fundamental mission.</p><p>Hospitals should divest from fossil fuels for the same reason. We need to recognize that these investments fundamentally oppose our healthcare mission. We need institutions such as the National Academy of Medicine to call out fossil fuel companies as dangers to human health and provide leadership on how and why to incorporate fossil fuel divestment into existing climate change commitments across our industry.</p><p>The healthcare sector is capable of miracles. We mapped the human genome. We conduct microsurgery. We can  and must  divest from the fossil fuels that are sickening our patients and our world.</p>Don Lieber is a surgical technician, nursing unit coordinator and director&nbsp;of the First Do No Harm campaign for fossil fuel divestment in the health sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

For the sake of science, safety and national security, these sightings deserve proper investigation, he said.</p><p>Yet no reported UAP has offered any answers to the question of whether we are alone in the universe.</p><p>To make the claim that we see something that is evidence of not-human intelligence would require extraordinary evidence, and we have not seen that, Spergel said. Most UAPs are going to turn out to be phenomena we understand.</p> Is it a bird? A plane? NASA will study mysterious objects in the sky<p>Consisting of experts in astrophysics, space exploration and aviation, the panel aims to guide NASA on which unclassified data to use when investigating UAPs. It is scheduled to release its final report in late July.</p><p>Its goal, former associate administrator of NASAs Science Mission Directorate <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/drthomasz/about-me/">Thomas Zurbuchen</a> explained last year, is to take a field that is relatively data-poor and make it into a field that is much more data-rich, and therefore worthy of scientific investigation and analysis.</p><p>At Wednesdays meeting, which took place at NASAs Washington headquarters and was streamed live on the agencys website, the study team confirmed that there is still a considerable deficit of quality data on the subject of UAPs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3100053/dod-announces-the-establishment-of-the-all-domain-anomaly-resolution-office/">All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office</a>, the Defense Department branch tasked with identifying anomalous phenomena, has investigated about 800 reports of UAPs made since 1996, director <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Jul/20/2003039076/-1/-1/1/DR-SEAN-M-KIRKPATRICK-BIOGRAPHY.PDF">Sean Kirkpatrick</a> told the panel.</p><p>Only about 2% to 5% of those sightings remain unexplained after investigation, Kirkpatrick said. The outstanding cases tend to be those with too little reliable information to support any conclusion, he said.</p> Spot a UFO? The Pentagon wants to know<p>While UAPs are often linked in the publics mind with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-seti1-2008jun01-story.html">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</a>, members of the panel stressed that they are not making any assumptions about the origins of sightings that dont yet have explanation.</p><p>We hope that within our lifetime we will be able to answer this big question of whether we are alone or not, and also better able to characterize this phenomenon that is UAPs, said <a href="https://science.gmu.edu/directory/anamaria-berea">Anamaria Berea</a>, an associate professor of computational and data science at George Mason University and a research affiliate with the <a href="https://www.seti.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4NujBhC5ARIsAF4Iv6cO5Rkf-UJpjXFz8H8uzbNcGtDFNsJ34vegMTp8zO3ZNFMsp43ye3QaAu-mEALw_wcB">SETI Institute</a> in Mountain View, Calif. </p><p>As an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-scott-mark-kelly-nasa-twin-study-astronaut-20160301-story.html">astronaut aboard the ISS</a>, Kelly said, he frequently saw things in space that struck him as inexplicable. Upon closer inspection, all turned out to be natural phenomena or a trick of light and perception.</p><p>This environment we operate in is so, so conducive to optical illusions, Kelly said. Its a very, very challenging environment to work in, especially at night.</p> UFO report can't explain mysterious flying objects, finds no link to alien life<p>Given its focus on what used to be commonly referred to as UFOs, the panels work has drawn an enormous amount of public scrutiny. Panel members have also received online abuse, several of them confirmed, both from people dismissive of any inquiry into UAPs and from those convinced there is more to the UFO story than NASA is willing to tell.</p><p>Theres no way that all scientists could be in on trying to hide something. Its not in our nature, said <a href="https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/grinspoon">David Grinspoon</a>, a senior scientist at the <a href="https://www.psi.edu/about">Planetary Science Institute</a> in Tuscon.</p><p>The panelists job  like that of all scientists  is to gather data and evaluate evidence before arriving at any conclusions, he said. </p><p>Thats why youre a good scientist," he said.

Air pollution is dangerous at local and regional levels, while climate was beyond the harmful levels for humans in groups but not quite past the safety guideline for the planet as a system, the study from the Swedish group said.</p><p>The study found hotspots of problem areas throughout Eastern Europe, South Asia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, parts of Africa and much of Brazil, Mexico, China and some of the U.S. West  much of it from <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2023-04-20/climate-change-is-here-its-time-californians-stopped-clinging-to-the-past-boiling-point">climate change</a>. About two-thirds of the Earth doesnt meet the criteria for freshwater safety, scientists said as an example.</p><p>We are in a danger zone for most of the Earth system boundaries, said study co-author Kristie Ebi, a professor of climate and public health at the University of Washington.</p><p>If planet Earth just got an annual checkup, similar to a persons physical, our doctor would say that the Earth is really quite sick right now and it is sick in terms of many different areas or systems, and this sickness is also affecting the people living on Earth, Earth Commission co-chair Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment at the University of Amsterdam, said at a news conference.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/c4/89/9e6a87d846ffbea41703e62e90e7/earth-environmental-limits-21633.jpg"></figure><p>Its not a terminal diagnosis. The planet can recover if it changes, including its use of coal, oil and natural gas and the way it treats the land and water, the scientists said.</p><p>But we are moving in the wrong direction on basically all of these, said study lead author Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.</p><p>This is a compelling and provocative paper  scientifically sound in methodology and important for identifying the dimensions in which the planet is nearing the edge of boundaries that would launch us into irreversible states, Indy Burke, dean of the Yale School of the Environment, said in an email. She wasnt part of the study.</p><p>The team of about 40 scientists created quantifiable boundaries for each environmental category, both for whats safe for the planet and for the point at which it becomes harmful for groups of people, which the researchers termed a justice issue.</p><p>Rockstrom said he thinks of those points as setting up a safety fence outside of which the risks become higher, but not necessarily fatal.</p><p>Rockstrom and other scientists have in the past tried this type of holistic measuring of Earths various interlocking ecosystems. The big difference in this attempt is that scientists also looked at local and regional levels, and they added the element of justice.</p><p>The justice part includes fairness between young and old generations, different nations and even different species. Frequently, it applies to conditions that harm people more than the planet. </p><p>An example of that is climate change. </p><p>The report uses the same boundary of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times that international leaders agreed upon in the 2015 Paris climate pact. The world has so far warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, so it hasnt crossed that safety fence, Rockstrom and Gupta said, but that doesnt mean people arent being hurt.</p><p>What we are trying to show through our paper is that even at 1 degree Centigrade [1.8 degrees Fahrenheit] there is a huge amount of damage taking place, Gupta said, pointing to tens of millions of people exposed to extreme hot temperatures.</p><p>Sustainability and justice are inseparable, said Stanford environmental studies chief Chris Field, who wasnt part of the research. He said he would want even more stringent boundaries. Unsafe conditions do not need to cover a large fraction of Earths area to be unacceptable, especially if the unsafe conditions are concentrated in and near poor and vulnerable communities.</p><p>Another outside expert, Lynn Goldman, an environment health professor and dean of George Washington Universitys public health school, said the study was kind of bold, but she wasnt optimistic that it would result in much action.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The order becomes effective in 90 days, allowing more time to negotiate a settlement.</p><p>DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the 68-page order that Morris &amp; Dickson failed to accept full responsibility for its past actions, which included shipping 12,000 unusually large orders of opioids to pharmacies and hospitals between 2014 and 2018. During this time, the company filed just three suspicious order reports with the DEA.</p> CVS and Walgreens announce opioid lawsuit settlements totaling $10 billion<p>Milgram specifically cited testimony of then-president Paul Dickson Sr. in 2019 that the companys compliance program was dang good and he didnt think a single person has gotten hurt by (their) drugs.</p><p>Those statements from the president of a family-owned and operated company so strongly miss the point of the requirements of a DEA registrant, she wrote. Its acceptance of responsibility did not prove that it or its principals understand the full extent of their wrongdoing ... and the potential harm it caused."</p><p>Shreveport, La.-based Morris &amp; Dickson traces its roots to 1840, when its namesake founder arrived from Wales and placed an ad in a local newspaper selling medicines. It has since become the nation's fourth-largest wholesale drug distributor, with $4 billion a year in revenue and nearly 600 employees serving pharmacies and hospitals in 29 states.</p><p>In a statement, the company said it has invested millions of dollars over the past few years to revamp its compliance systems and appeared to hold out hope for a settlement. </p><p>Morris &amp; Dickson is grateful to the DEA administrator for delaying the effective date of the order to allow time to settle these old issues, it said. We remain confident we can achieve an outcome that safeguards the supply chain for all of our healthcare partners and the communities they serve.</p> Walmart offers to pay $3.1 billion to settle opioid lawsuits nationwide<p>Morris &amp; Dicksons much larger competitors, a trio of pharmaceutical distributors known as the Big Three, have already agreed to pay the federal government more than $1 billion in fines and penalties to settle similar violations. Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson also agreed to pay $21 billion over 18 years to resolve claims as part of a nationwide settlement.</p><p>While Morris &amp; Dickson wasnt the only drug distributor who the DEA accused of fueling the opioid crisis, it was unique in its willingness to challenge those accusations in the DEAs administrative court.</p><p>In a scathing recommendation in 2019, Administrative Law Judge Charles W. Dorman said Morris &amp; Dicksons argument that it has changed its ways was too little, too late.</p><p>Anything less than the most severe punishment, the judge said, would communicate to DEA registrants that despite their transgressions, no matter how egregious, they will get a mere slap on the wrist and a second chance so long as they acknowledge their sins and vow to sin no more.</p><p>But as the ensuing years passed, neither the Biden-nominated Milgram nor her two predecessors took any enforcement action. Past DEA officials told the AP such decisions usually take no more than two years.</p> Fentanyl, other synthetic opioids are driving deadliest overdose crisis in the U.S.<p>As the pills kept flowing, Morris &amp; Dickson attempted to stave off punishment, appealing directly to Milgram to order a reopening of the proceedings, arguing it would introduce new evidence showing it had implemented an ideal compliance program with the help of a consultant who is now second-in-command at the DEA, Louis Milione. The DEA said that Milione has recused himself from all agency business related to Morris &amp; Dickson.</p><p>Milione retired from the DEA in 2017 after a 21-year career that included two years leading the division that controls the sale of highly addictive narcotics. Like dozens of colleagues in the DEAs powerful-but-little-known Office of Diversion Control, he went to work as a consultant for some of the same companies he had been tasked with regulating.</p><p>Milione was hired by Morris &amp; Dickson in 2018 as part of a $3-million contract and later testified that the company spared no expense to overhaul its compliance systems, cancel suspicious orders and send daily emails to the DEA spelling out its actions.</p><p>A footnote of the DEAs order Friday said that since Milione returned to the DEA as principal deputy administrator in 2021, he has not had any contact with Milgram or other agency staff about the Morris &amp; Dickson case due to his prior involvement with the company.</p>Goodman reported from Miami, Mustian from New York.                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
