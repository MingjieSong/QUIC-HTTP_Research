A daughter of Ung migrated to a different country, and they were reunited recently for the first time in many years.</p><p>Her daughter “has come to see her mother, and now to bury her,” the statement said.</p><p>The relatives said they are processing pain, grief and anger, but asked that “we move forward in the coming weeks and months as a community with love and kindness, as antidotes to the violence we have experienced.”</p><p>“Our family story has echoes all over our San Gabriel Valley community. Of war, migration, loss, love, hardship, hard work, pain, and joy,” Ung’s family wrote. “Let us come together stronger as a family and community. Let us make sure that beyond this moment, we continue to dance and create spaces for joy.”</p></div></div></scroll-scene><scroll-scene class="stick"><div id="lilan-li" class="flex-space scroller-item"><header class="text-2xl hide-on-desktop sticky-mobile"><h3 class="leading-title mb-x1"><a class="no-underline" href="#lilan-li">LiLan Li</a></h3><p class="details mt-x3">, 63</p><img class="calligraphy" src="/projects/monterey-park-shooting-victims-tribute/assets/images/LilanLi.4fc984f7.png" alt="Name written in calligraphic style"></header><div class="md:w-3 flex-space__photo mx-auto position-relative"><div class="sticky-top"><header class="text-2xl hide-on-mobile"><h3 class="leading-title mb-x1"><a class="no-underline" href="#lilan-li">LiLan Li</a></h3><p class="details mt-x3">, 63</p><img class="calligraphy" src="/projects/monterey-park-shooting-victims-tribute/assets/images/LilanLi.4fc984f7.png" alt="Name written in calligraphic style"></header><figure class="mb-1"><img class="lazy" data-src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b2/8f/c3fc810549f0b1e5fdbe2b9f99df/1249553-me-daughter-of-mp-shooting-victim-ajs-0199-crop.jpg" width="1919" height="2686" alt="A photo of Monterey Park mass shooting victim Lilan Li is memorialized among the 11 victims photos, flowers and candles in front of the Star Ballroom Dance Studio Monday, Jan. 30, 2023 in Monterey Park, CA."><figcaption class="figcaption"><span class="figcredit">(Allen J.

Taken away from us is an opportunity for her grandson to ever feel her love and warmth," Yi wrote. "May she now rest in peace ... and stay forever in the hearts of the living."</p><p>In addition to Yi, her only daughter, Li is survived by two sisters, a brother and two grandchildren, the family said. Most of Li's family are in China, so the GoFundme fundraiser will help relatives travel to California for the funeral.</p><p>"Unfortunately an evening that should have been filled with light, love, and celebration was cut short by a mass shooting," Li's nephew wrote in the fundraiser's description. "The family is devastated by this tragic event due to senseless gun violence."</p><p>Yi thanked the community for support, prayers and kind words since the tragedy.
