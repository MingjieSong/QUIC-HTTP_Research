But they had no memory of landing or taxiing Spirit Airlines Flight 708. Tellmann went to the hospital for treatment and spent the next week at home in bed, vomiting and shaking and feeling “like a freight train had run over us,” he said in a letter to his union about the July 2015 event.</p><p class="copy 2">A mysterious smell. Strange symptoms. A trip to the emergency room.</p><p class="copy 3">The signs were all there: Something had gone seriously wrong with the plane’s air supply.</p><p class="copy 4">The air you breathe on airplanes comes directly from the jet engines. Known as bleed air, it is safe, unless there is a mechanical issue — a faulty seal, for instance. When that happens, heated jet engine oil can leak into the air supply, potentially releasing toxic gases into the plane.</p><p class="copy 5">For decades, the airline industry and its regulators have known about these incidents — called fume events — and have maintained that they are rare and that the toxic chemical levels are too low to pose serious health risks.</p><p class="copy 6"></p></div><p></p><div class="dg-gpt-ad-container"><div class="dg-gpt-ad"></div></div><p class="copy 8"></p><div class="container"><p></p><p class="copy 9"><section class="content"></section></p><p class="copy 10">But a Times investigation found that vapors from oil and other fluids seep into planes with alarming frequency across all airlines, at times creating chaos and confusion: Flight attendants vomit and pass out. Passengers struggle to breathe. Children get rushed to hospitals. Pilots reach for oxygen masks or gasp for air from opened cockpit windows.</p><p class="copy 11">Such events are documented in airport paramedic records, NASA safety reports, federal aviation records and other filings reviewed by The Times.</p><p class="copy 12">Tellmann, the Spirit Airlines pilot, was one of hundreds of airline crew members and passengers who reported being sickened or impaired on flights in recent years. A Times analysis of NASA safety reports from January 2018 to December 2019 identified 362 fume events that airline crew members reported to the agency, with nearly 400 pilots, flight attendants and passengers receiving medical attention. During at least 73 of those flights, pilots used emergency oxygen. Four dozen pilots were described as impaired to the point of being unable to perform their duties.</p><p class="copy 13">Because they’re made voluntarily, the NASA safety reports are the “tip of the iceberg,” according to a recent study by a researcher from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p><p class="copy 14"></p></div><p></p><div class="pullquote-cloud-container"><div class="fumes lazy-bg left grow"></div><div class="pullquote"><p class="quote">&lsquo;We began using oxygen. … By this time in my opinion <span class="highlight">we both were becoming more and more incapacitated.</span>&rsquo;</p><p class="attribution"><a href="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ec/24/51ee5e1746e5847a7c23462d69c3/nasa-report.pdf">Anonymous pilot in NASA report</a> <i class="LATPage"></i></p></div></div><p class="copy 16"></p><div class="container"><p></p><p class="copy 17"><section class="content"></section></p><p class="copy 18">As millions of holiday travelers ignore public health warnings against flying amid a surge of new COVID-19 cases, airlines are touting their HEPA filters, cleaning practices and other precautions to convince passengers that their planes are safe. But those measures won’t protect you from toxic gases. Neither will surgical masks nor N95 respirators.</p><p class="copy 19">Indeed, fume events have continued throughout the pandemic. One week in August, for example, JetBlue Airways had fume events on flights into Boston and Orlando, Fla., federal aviation records show. On a March 26 American Airlines flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., all flight attendants used oxygen after cabin fumes left them dizzy and nauseated.</p><p class="copy 20">Passengers are often unaware that their air supply has been contaminated. Fume events can be odorless, and some of the most common symptoms of exposure — headaches and fatigue — are indistinguishable from jet lag, experts say. Airlines have no obligation to notify passengers of fume events and have sometimes provided misleading information.</p><p class="copy 21">In the era before the coronavirus, about five flights a day in the U.S. experienced a fume event, according to an academic study of aviation records. But no government agency tracks fume events or how often people become sick or impaired.</p><p class="copy 22">Pilots and flight attendants have reported an array of health problems, including eye irritation and coughing, as well as more serious long-term conditions: tremors, memory problems, brain damage and other illnesses that have kept them out of work for months and sometimes ended their careers, according to airport and aviation records, workers’ compensation filings, court papers and other documents.</p><p class="copy 23">Scientists have long warned of potential dangers from breathing heated jet engine oil, which contains tricresyl phosphate, a highly toxic chemical that can damage the nervous system. Heated oil can also produce carbon monoxide, an acutely incapacitating gas. A 2002 study mandated by Congress recommended requiring carbon monoxide sensors on all passenger airplanes. Today, most homes have them; airplanes do not.</p><!-- end container--></div><!-- canvas for the smoke / plane --><section class="scroller"><!-- this would be class scroller-graphic--><div class="plane-container scroller-graphic"><!-- this would be class graphic, id example--><canvas class="graphic" id="canvas"></canvas></div><div class="scroller-steps"><div class="step" id="scene1"><div id="intro-section"><h1 class="graphic-title">How toxic air gets inside a plane</h1><div class="spinner-container"><progress id="loader" max="1" value="0"></progress></div></div></div><div class="step" id="scene2"><p>Outside air is sucked in through the <b class="blue-engine">plane's engines.</b></p></div><div class="step" id="scene3"><p>The air gets extremely hot as it's compressed in the <b class="hot-air">turbines</b>.<br><br>Some of the air is pulled off the engine and routed into the plane's <b class="ac">air conditioning system</b>.</p></div><div class="step" id="scene4"><p>If there's a mechanical issue such as a faulty seal, <b class="toxic">toxic gases</b> from the heated engine oil can leak into the air.<br><br>Plane fluids from the <b class="engine">engine</b> on the back of the plane can also create toxic gas.</p></div><div class="step" id="scene5"><p><b class="toxic">Toxic air is circulated</b> through the cabin.</p></div></div></section><div class="container after-plane"><p class="copy 25">Airlines have been asking Boeing to install air sensors for years.

Hill called ahead for paramedics, and when he landed in Charlotte, N.C., ambulances and firetrucks were already on the tarmac.</p><p class="copy 137">Paramedics took Hill and the rest of the crew to the emergency room with symptoms of dizziness, headaches, breathing difficulties and confusion.</p><p class="copy 138">Within a month, Hill couldn’t read an analog clock.</p><p class="copy 139">Within six months, Hill received a letter from the FAA ending his three-decade flying career.</p><p class="copy 140">“A careful review of your reports ... after your Jan 16, 2010 fume incident on Flight 1041, discloses that you do not meet the medical standards,” the FAA said, referring to health requirements necessary to safely perform the duties of a pilot.</p><p class="copy 141">The letter listed dizziness, imbalance and chemical exposure as the reasons for pulling his certificate.</p><figure class="inline"><img class="lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 3 2'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/dave_hill1-600.a7846c01.jpg 600w, /projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/dave_hill1-768.34a0b891.jpg 768w, /projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/dave_hill1-1200.ccecce43.jpg 1200w" alt="US Airways Capt.

In January 2010, a fume event during a flight from the Virgin Islands left Hill and his copilot groggy and sickened five flight attendants, sending them all to the emergency room. Afterward, Hill and his copilot both lost their FAA certifications.(Facebook)</figcaption></figure><p class="copy 143">A year later, Hill wrote the FAA, urging it to mandate air filters and sensors. He said his copilot and flight attendants suffered neurological damage and were also unable to work. He questioned why the agency had not informed passengers that they had also been exposed to dangerous chemicals.</p><p class="copy 144">This time, the agency took a different stance.</p><p class="copy 145">“We have not been able to trace clear cause-and-effect relationships between contaminant exposure and short-term and long-term health effects,” wrote Dorenda Baker, the FAA’s director of aircraft certification.</p><p class="copy 146">“I am sorry to hear of your difficulties,” Baker added.</p><p class="copy 147">Over the years, the FAA has sent mixed messages on whether fume events are harmful. The agency funded a 2009 <a href="http://www.ohrca.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/finalreport.pdf">medical guide</a> for treating health problems related to fume events. It warns that “neurological, psychiatric, respiratory, systemic, and dermal symptoms … may last for years after the exposure.”</p><p class="copy 148">There is scientific consensus that the chemicals in engine oil are highly toxic and can damage the nervous system.</p><aside class="graphic-container smell-card"><div class="graphic-inner-container"><p class="leadin-text">If you smell ...</p><img id="smell" src="/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/chemicals.093f9f2b.svg" alt=" line illustration of liquid chemical in an Erlenmeyer flask"><p class="smell-text">Chemicals</p><p class="smell-description">It might mean a presence of engine oil, hydraulic fluid or other airplane fluids in the air supply.</p></div></aside><p class="copy 150">But the industry argues that the levels of those chemicals during fume events are too low to cause health problems. However, no major study has ever tested the chemical levels during fume events or collected data on illnesses.</p><p class="copy 151">Scientists have found that oil and hydraulic fluid break down when heated, producing toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, which is classified as a human carcinogen by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p><p class="copy 152">Perhaps most troubling is tricresyl phosphate, or TCP, an organophosphate added to engine oil. Doctors and scientific researchers have known that TCP is toxic to the nervous system since the 1930s. Researchers say that extreme heat, such as in a jet engine, makes oil fumes even more toxic to breathe.</p><p class="copy 153">TCP can have immediate effects such as headaches and dizziness, as well as longer-term effects such as tremors and memory problems, experts say.</p><p class="copy 154">The effects of breathing engine oil fumes vary from one person to the next, said Van Netten, the University of British Columbia toxicologist. “The same goes for the pilots. That’s why one pilot might feel incapacitated and the other pilot is able to keep working.”</p><p class="copy 155">Airbus, in a cabin air contamination report form it distributes to airlines, recognizes that air contamination can cause symptoms including fainting and headaches. But the manufacturer also tells its customers that there are “no proven long-term health risks.”</p><aside class="support"><h3><a href="http://www.latimes.com/subscriptions/">Support our journalism <i class="LATLinkOutArrow"></i></a></h3><p>Please consider subscribing today to support more stories like this. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/subscriptions/">Get full access</a> to our journalism for just 99 cents for the first four weeks.

DHL, the shipping company, installed cockpit air filters on its Boeing 757s, and several airlines have begun testing air filters and sensors.<p></p><p class="copy 158">Many people recover from fume-related ailments within days. But some have been diagnosed with life-altering and career-ending health conditions.</p><p class="copy 159">Raymond Ottesen, a pilot at a major U.S. airline, said he has been unable to fly since 2016 following exposure to fumes that left him with severe health problems. Pilots “could be incapacitated, and you’re sitting in the back thinking everything is good,” said Ottesen, whose lawsuit against Boeing, filed in 2018, is pending. Boeing denied the claims.</p><p class="copy 160">JetBlue Capt. Andrew Myers was parked at the gate at Portland International Airport in Oregon one morning in January 2017 running engine tests before passengers boarded the flight to Long Beach. He was trying to figure out the cause of a foul odor that flight attendants and passengers had complained about the previous day. Suddenly a thick haze and a strong choking smell like dirty socks filled the plane. Myers left the aircraft seeking fresh air and fell down on the jetway coughing, according to workers’ compensation filings.</p><p class="copy 161">Before his fume event, Myers, 52, had been training for a triathlon. After the event, he needed a cane to walk, suffered from tremors and struggled to speak, the filings show. At times he couldn’t remember where he was.</p><p class="copy 162">A year later Myers received a letter from the FAA pulling his medical certificate due to his “toxic encephalopathy” — brain damage from exposure to toxic chemicals.</p><p class="copy 163">In Myers’ workers’ compensation case, JetBlue denied that his injuries were caused by the fumes and hired Richard Pleus, a toxicologist who regularly consults for Boeing and airlines. Pleus testified that the dose of chemical exposure on a plane was too low to cause physical harm — an argument that was rejected by the judge. Pleus declined to comment.</p><p class="copy 164">In perhaps the first decision of its kind, the workers’ compensation judge, Darren Otto, <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20423200-judge-ruling-in-jetblue-captain-andrew-myers-case">wrote</a> that “it was not necessary to know the exact amount” of inhaled toxic chemicals to establish a “causal relationship” with fume injuries. JetBlue has appealed.</p><p class="copy 165">In the hundreds of recent fume events described in the NASA records, pilots and flight attendants frequently report that airlines are pressuring them to fly unsafe planes. The incidents disproportionately affect flight attendants, who lack oxygen masks that can be deployed discreetly behind closed doors. The safety reports cite numerous cases of crew members — particularly flight attendants — being punished for taking sick days after fume events or airlines refusing to count the injuries as work-related.</p><p class="copy 166">“We are slowly being poisoned to ill health, or possibly death,” wrote one flight attendant.</p><div class="symptoms-box" id="expandable-box"><p id="symptoms-box-teaser">How do you know if you've been exposed to contaminated bleed air?

Boeing has denied the claims.</p><p class="copy 169">Linda Curry, one of the United flight attendants bringing the suit, said that two years after her January 2018 fume event on a flight from Amsterdam to Newark, she still has memory problems and dizzy spells and can work only part time. “I didn’t know what a fume event was until it happened to me,” said Curry, who lives in Florida. United declined to comment.</p><figure class="inline"><img class="lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 3 2'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-srcset="/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/linda_curry-600.bf11857b.jpg 600w, /projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/linda_curry-768.74fe89c8.jpg 768w, /projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/assets/img/linda_curry-1200.c0d76f7e.jpg 1200w" alt="Linda Curry, a United Airlines flight attendant, is a plaintiff in a lawsuit against Boeing."><figcaption class="figcaption">Linda Curry, a United Airlines flight attendant, walks near her home in Satellite Beach, Fla.

Ebenhack / For the Los Angeles Times)</figcaption></figure><p class="copy 171">In another air contamination lawsuit, five Alaska Airlines flight attendants claimed that fume exposure left them with tremors, memory loss, speech problems and other injuries.</p><p class="copy 172">The suit <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20423214-2019-8-19-p-3rd-amended-complaint-res-ipsa">alleged that Boeing had long known of the dangers</a> of air contamination but failed to equip planes with air sensors and filters. Boeing denied the claims.</p><p class="copy 173">Dr. Dennis Stumpp, Boeing’s former manager for occupational medicine who has provided expert opinion on behalf of the industry, testified that only one of the 150 or so flight attendants he has examined over the years was legitimately sick from fumes. He diagnosed the rest with problems including hyperventilation and “inadequate coping skills,” according to a transcript of his deposition.</p><p class="copy 174">When Stumpp examined one of the Alaska Airlines flight attendants in the case, he concluded that her dizziness and headache on the plane were likely caused by a panic attack, not any toxic chemicals. Stumpp did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p class="copy 175">The industry’s experts often diagnose ailments in fume event cases as “somatic,” said Dr. Robert Harrison, a UC San Francisco medical professor who has treated over 100 crew members and was a plaintiffs’ expert in the lawsuit.</p><p class="copy 176">“It’s a polite way of saying that the flight attendants are crazy, mostly hysterical women,” Harrison said.</p><p class="copy 177">Boeing settled the case in December 2019 for an undisclosed amount.</p><p class="copy 178"></p><h2 class="subhead">A pilot's steady decline</h2><p></p><p class="copy 179">Years after fumes engulfed his US Airways flight, Hill was still waging a losing battle with declining health.
