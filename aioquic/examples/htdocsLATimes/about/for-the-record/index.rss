One of the photos shows a stack of boxes that had fallen over in a storage room. Visible in the photo are documents marked with a designation that the information can only be released to the closest allies of the U.S.: Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Trump is charged with willful retention of national defense information; conspiracy to obstruct justice; withholding a document or record; corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation; scheming to conceal; and false statements and representations.</p><p>In a brief televised statement, Smith urged the public to read the indictment in order to understand "the gravity of the crimes charged." He also said he was aiming for a speedy trial.</p><p>The men and women of the United States intelligence community and our armed forces dedicate their lives to protecting our nation and its people. Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States and they must be enforced, Smith said. "We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone."</p><p>The indictment details accusations that in two instances in 2021, Trump shared classified information with people who lacked security clearances. The indictment also confirms a CNN report on the existence of a recording in which Trump indicates understanding that he cannot declassify records after leaving office and acknowledges that he possesses a classified record.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/ff/67/601cc6bf424a8d142cb521c10425/trump-classified-documents-39430.jpg"></figure><p>The investigation began after the National Archives found classified records in a batch of documents Trump returned </p> in 2022,<p> a year after leaving office. Justice Department officials then sought a subpoena demanding that he return any other classified material in his possession. </p><p>The indictment cites notes from a May 23</p> , 2022, <p>conversation between Trump and his lawyer Evan Corcoran in which the former president questioned whether he had to fully comply with the subpoena, including making the statements, "I don't want anybody looking through my boxes. I don't want you looking through my boxes," "Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?" and, "Well look, isn't it better if there are no documents?"</p><p>Trumps legal team ultimately produced about three dozen additional documents and a letter stating that a diligent search had turned up nothing more. But the indictment says Trump's lawyers didn't have access to all of the records for their search. </p><p>The indictment states that between May 23 and June 2 of last year  during the window after the subpoena was issued but before Corcoran could review the documents  Trump had his personal aide Waltine "Walt" Nauta move 64 boxes out of the Mar-a-Lago storage room to Trump's residence so the former president could go through the contents, and that Nauta later returned only 30 boxes to the storage room. This was hidden from Corcoran, according to the indictment.</p><figure> <img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/e0/49/16c4128d448090e5829c95f52047/aptopix-trump-classified-documents-23595.jpg"></figure><p>The Justice Department learned of the move and the possibility that classified documents remained at the estate, and gained judicial approval for a search warrant. More than <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-09-02/judge-unseals-detailed-inventory-of-mar-a-lago-search">100 documents with classified markings were found</a> during an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago that August. The indictment states that the recovered classified records came from the CIA, the Defense Department, the National Security Agency and the State Department, among other sources.</p><p>Nauta was indicted alongside Trump on charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record, corruptly concealing a document in a federal investigation, scheming to conceal and making false statements and representations.</p><p>Trump defended Nauta, a Navy veteran who was frequently by his side in the White House, in a Truth Social post before the indictment was made public.</p><p>"He has done a fantastic job! They are trying to destroy his life, like the lives of so many others, hoping that he will say bad things about 'Trump,' the former president said of Nauta.</p><p>The special counsel's investigation has focused in part on Nauta, who is reportedly seen on surveillance video helping a maintenance worker move boxes from the storage room before the FBI executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>According to the indictment, Nauta made multiple false statements, including saying he was not aware the boxes had been taken to Trumps residence for review before 15 of them were sent to the National Archives, and didn't know how boxes taken to a National Archives truck had come to be in the residence; and that he falsely denied knowing where the boxes had been stored before they were found in Trumps residence, saying, I wish I could tell you. I dont know. I dont  I honestly just dont know.</p><p>Trump announced<a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-06-08/trump-special-counsel-indictment-classified-documents"> in a social media post Thursday</a> that he had been indicted in connection with his handling of the records and had been ordered to appear in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon. The indictment comes nearly a year after more than 100 documents with classified markings were found during the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>The case appears to have been initially directed toward U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who handled his lawsuit last year over the FBI search. Cannons <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2022-12-01/appeals-court-special-master-trump-documents">decision to appoint a special master</a> to review materials seized in the search delayed the investigation for several weeks.</p><p>Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and claimed again late Thursday that he was innocent. On Friday he announced that he was shaking up his legal team, replacing attorneys Jim Trusty and John Rowley with New York-based Todd Blanche and a firm to be named later. Blanche is assisting with Trump's other indictment on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-03-30/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels">34 felony charges related to an alleged hush money payment</a> to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign.</p><p>Trusty and Rowley said in a joint statement that they had resigned, calling it a logical moment to leave because the case had moved to Miami.</p><p>Trump and his allies quickly framed the new indictment as an attempt to diminish him as a political opponent, with some such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) misrepresenting the legal process.</p><p>"If the people in power can jail their political opponents at will, we dont have a republic," Hawley, a lawyer and former state attorney general, tweeted.</p><p>Such claims disregard that it was a grand jury that recommended the charges based on evidence presented to it, and that it will be a jury that decides Trump's guilt or innocence on the charges based on the evidence provided in court.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The other, Jeff Ranen, recalled giving a rousing Jerry Maguire speech to convince colleagues to follow him out the door.</p><p>But over the weekend, Lewis Brisbois struck back. </p><p>In an extraordinary move, its management team directed the release of scores of emails in which Barber and Ranen used vile terms for women, Black people, Armenians, Persians, and gay men and traded in offensive stereotypes of Jews and Asians. In one fell swoop, the venerable firm managed to torpedo its new rival, destroy the defecting partners careers and send the legal establishment reeling.</p><p>The emails, stretching back 15 years, were head-spinning in their coarseness and vitriol. A Superior Court judge was called Sugar </p>Tits <p>Ts. Multiple female lawyers were referred to as "c</p>t<p>." The epithets fag and faggot were deployed as all-purpose insults. An Asian job applicant was denigrated for the supposed size of his genitalia. Ranen dismissed another job candidate with, How about someone whos not a Jew.</p><p>By Monday, the emails had been excerpted by the New York Post and the Forward, a Jewish newspaper, and the nascent firm Barber Ranen had collapsed.</p><p>"The last 72 hours have been the most difficult of our lives, as we have had to acknowledge and reckon with those emails," Barber and Ranen said in a joint statement announcing their resignations. "We are ashamed of the words we wrote, and we are deeply sorry."</p><p>Barber Ranens chief executive Tim Graves, a former Lewis Brisbois attorney, said in a statement that the remaining partners will form a new firm and asked for support while we heal and plan our path forward.</p><p>The roster of lawyers was stripped from the Barber Ranen website, and some had already asked for their old jobs back at Lewis Brisbois, a spokesperson said.</p><p>It was not all good news for the firm. Some saw the email release as a self-own for Lewis Brisbois, revealing a culture of bigotry thriving in some corners of the behemoth firm. Many objectionable messages were copied to co-workers, from junior associates to fellow partners.</p><p>I just dont understand that, said Ann Park, a corporate litigator and president of the L.A. County Bar Assn. It just reflects poorly on  obviously these lawyers  but also on their colleagues for not calling it out.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois recently retained a diversity, equity and inclusion consultant to review internal practices, according to a spokesperson.</p><p>The men writing the emails were not junior employees, but influential veterans and supervisors. Barber was a member of the firms management committee, which governs its nearly 1,700 attorneys in 55 offices around the country, and Ranen had been the youngest person to make partner, according to his former firm biography. Both helped run its labor and employment practice, defending corporations against harassment and discrimination lawsuits.</p><p>Though the departure they instigated in early May represented about 8% of the firms lawyers, it came on top of an exodus earlier in the year of 30 others. Within days, the firms 87-year-old chair, Bob Lewis, who had founded it in 1979, stepped aside for a rejiggered management team.</p><p>Meanwhile, Barber and Ranens new practice was attracting positive coverage in legal news outlets. According to Lewis Brisbois, it was during this time that the firm received an anonymous complaint about the former partners. It specifically recommended the firm scrutinize the emails of both men, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Firm managers launched an investigation and were shocked to find dozens of emails  with unacceptable, prejudiced language aimed at our colleagues, clients, attorneys from other firms, and even judges, the firm said in a statement.</p><p>The firms leaders consulted ethics experts who laid out a variety of options: publish the emails on the Lewis Brisbois website; share the emails with partners at Barber and Ranens new firm; and file a complaint with the State Bar of California, which licenses attorneys, according to the person familiar with the discussions.</p><p>Ultimately, firm leaders chose to provide the media with a curated, partly redacted set of correspondence  a decision that was presented as transparency and which many in the legal field saw as revenge delivered ice cold.</p><p>Scott Cummings, a UCLA law professor who teaches ethics, said that there was no legal requirement that the firm make the emails public, but that it was the ethically correct thing to do because it informed prospective employees and clients of the repugnant views the men held.</p><p>Bringing these things to light does go toward protecting the public and alerting the profession to conduct that should be stopped, Cummings said. Even if Lewis Brisbois was motivated by vengeance, he said, the benefits to the field and the public still stood. These things can happen simultaneously.</p><p>Barber and Ranen practiced in an area where company email accounts are routinely mined for evidence, and racist, sexist or other bigoted messages can translate to costly settlements or verdicts.</p><p>Yet both men appeared to revel in their flagrant disregard for professionalism and decency. In 2013, Ranen told Barber that if you want to have fun for a second, he should keyword search the words c and Jew on your email inbox and sent box.</p><p>It's like you know me, Barber replied.</p><p>The pair injected mundane work correspondence with antisemitism. Ranen repeatedly used Jew as a synonym for haggling over prices: I might be able to Jew them down to $390, he wrote in 2016. When Ranen alerted colleagues to bagels he had brought to the office in 2014, Barber replied, Jew c.</p><p>In a boasting 2012 email, Ranen told Barber, Gypsy is my new word to describe about half of the minorities in California. Generally with an Armo, Persian or middle eastern flair.</p><p>Over the next decade, Ranen invoked the gypsy moniker repeatedly to mock several attorneys, prompting one</p>  fellow colleague<p> at Lewis Brisbois to </p> confide in him <p>last year, Dirty Gypsy is my new favorite epithet.</p><p>Sex was another frequent topic. After a friend promised a 2015 trip to Las Vegas where debauchery level is unprecedented, Ranen said he would get a continuance in a federal trial to attend and informed others accompanying him, Were going to a strip club or bringing in hookers.</p><p>When a female lawyer asked for upgrades to the firm lactation room, Ranen forwarded it to a male colleague with speculation about her appearance after bearing two children. He then added, She could be 200 pounds and acne scarred and after all this time Id still f her.</p><p>The emails also include a seemingly gratuitous use by Barber of the n-word. After a colleague informed him that another participant in a 2013 mediation objected to the word being spoken, Barber replied, Got it. He then spelled out the word.</p><p>Lewis Brisbois redacted the names of many individuals who participated in the odious conversations, but the names of some maligned are visible. One is Linda Miller Savitt, an employment lawyer at a rival law firm who Ranen described as a real c in a 2018 email to two other lawyers.</p><p>Its very disappointing to learn this about colleagues, even if they are competitors, she told The Times. Savitt represents the newspaper in employment litigation.</p><p>Jonathan Delshad, an attorney who opposed Lewis Brisbois in a 2016 case, found out from The Times on Tuesday that Ranen had written of him to a co-worker, Tell him that hes the reason why most people hate Jews.</p><p>I make it a point not to get caught up in personal disputes, Delshad said, adding, I do my best to treat every human being with dignity and respect regardless of our position on a legal dispute.</p><p>Merle Vaughn, an attorney and legal recruiter specializing in finding diverse candidates, said that the emails raised the question of what office life had been like for women and minorities.</p><p>If they were putting that in writing, what were the quote-unquote microaggressions they had to endure to keep their job, said Vaughn, the managing partner in the L.A. office of Major, Lindsey &amp; Africa.</p><p>Their apparent comfort in putting offensive ideas in writing was evidence, she said, that they believe they are above it and they wont get caught.</p><p>Barber seemed to recognize as much. In 2015, he told an acquaintance, There is no NSFW for me, abbreviating "not safe for work."</p><p>"My average email would get someone fired," he added.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
