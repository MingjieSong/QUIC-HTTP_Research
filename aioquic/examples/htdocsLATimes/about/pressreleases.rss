They honor the nations top food authors, broadcast producers, hosts, journalists, podcasters and social media content creators.</p><p>Addisons award-winning entries include <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-04-28/ponchos-tlayudas-review-addison">Ponchos Tlayudas, a window to Oaxaca, serves one of L.A.s defining dishes</a>; <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-08-04/pearl-river-deli-chinatown-review-bill-addison">At Chinatowns Pearl River Deli, the menu is always changing  and worth chasing;</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2022-07-22/anajak-thai-sherman-oaks-restaurant-of-the-year-2022">Anajak Thai is our 2022 Restaurant of the Year</a>.</p><p>The subjects of the three reviews "are all places that encapsulate the specific greatness of Los Angeles," said Addison. One celebrates the reopening of Ponchos Tlayudas, a Friday night pop-up stand serving one of Oaxacas (and L.A.s) defining specialties. The second, Pearl River Deli, details a Cantonese-American restaurant in Chinatown fueled by a chef "with an incessantly restless creativity," he said. And the third  about Anajak Thai, The Times' 2022 Restaurant of the Year  centers on a son returning to run the Sherman Oaks restaurant his parents started in the 1980s. "He reimagined the restaurant to both honor what they created while also looking forward in ways that has inspired so many in the L.A. culinary community," Addison added.</p><p>Every time I read a new review by Bill I learn something new  usually two or three or more new things, actually, said Food Editor Daniel Hernandez. His precision and expertise, passion for each subject, and dedication to the most exacting standards make him a joy to publish. L.A. Times Food is very lucky to have him!"</p><p>Addison said he was particularly gratified to be honored by the James Beard Foundation. "Awards are a funny business  they can mean nothing, they can mean everything," he said. "It would be disingenuous if I didnt admit that this particular award is one Ive been hoping to win since about the first month I began writing restaurant reviews 21 years ago. Im grateful to have the opportunity to do some of the best work of my career for the Times."</p><p><a href="https://www.jamesbeard.org/blog/the-2023-james-beard-media-award-winners">See the complete list of James Beard Media Award winners</a>.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

The reporting team, working from a secret recording provided by an unknown source, worked quickly and methodically to first authenticate the recording and then contact and interview the people involved. As well as exposing racism among certain city council members and leading to the resignation of the council president and the city's labor leader, it prompted a letter from President Biden and instigated a detailed examination of the city's divisive and occasionally explosive racial history.</p><p>In addition, the Daily Pilot won first place in the feature story category of the print competition for a story on the group <a href="https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2022-08-06/low-tide-aliens-inscribe-sacred-geometry-into-the-sands-of-newport-beach">Low Tide Aliens who are creating sacred geometry in Newport Beach</a>, and first place in the profiles category of the print division for a story on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/story/2022-07-02/metal-detector-man">Newport Beach retiree Stan Ross</a>.</p><p>The complete list of award winners can be found at <a href="https://cnpa.com/">cnpa.com</a>.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>

Founded in 1934 by the Press Club of Atlantic City, the competition is one of the oldest and largest annual contests recognizing outstanding journalism. The winners were announced on May 10.</p><p>Among the highlights: Staff Photographer Christina House won first place and best in show in the single day photo story category for the multimedia series <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-13/hollywoods-finest-series-pregnancy-homelessness-los-angeles">Hollywoods Finest,</a> for which she, along with Times Staff Writer Gale Holland and videographer Claire Hannah Collins, spent more than four years following Mckenzie Trahan as she prepared for the birth of her daughter, transitioned to motherhood and struggled to find and keep a home in which to raise her baby. The judges called Houses entry an epic tale of  love, loss, drugs, motherhood and homelessness on the streets of Los Angeles.</p><p>In addition, three entries from The Times took first-place honors. Staff Writer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/people/alene-tchekmedyian">Alene Tchekmedyian</a> earned first place in the local news beat coverage or continuing story in top 20 media market category for The chaotic tenure of L.A. Countys combative sheriff, a series of articles that chronicled Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanuevas troubled term. Public, personal attacks by a powerful sheriff did not deter Alene Tchekmedyians determination to uncover abuses by his deputies and a conflict of interest involving weapons permits and donors, the judges noted. She combed documents and convinced terrified workers to speak to her, uncovering a pattern of unethical conduct that played a role in his landslide defeat in the next election.</p><p>Times staff also earned first place in the news series in daily newspapers top 20 media market category for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-10-19/packed-in-overcrowded-housing-los-angeles">Packed In: Overcrowded housing in Los Angeles has brought death by design</a>, a series that explored how L.A. became the most overcrowded place in the U.S. and revealed how some of the citys poorest residents are affected. The reporters convey how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed poor housing conditions that developed over decades in L.A., the judges commented. They well explain how flawed decisions by leaders led to overpriced and outdated housing and zoom in to detail the deadly effect.</p><p>Staff Writer <a href="https://www.latimes.com/people/michael-finnegan">Michael Finnegan</a> received first-place honors in the feature writing by an individual in a top 20 media market category for a features portfolio that included Fentanyl poisoning, child exploitation and COVID relief fraud, which exposed a sprawling Hollywood drug delivery business. The judges lauded Finnegan for using richly detailed narratives to illuminate how criminals poison unsuspecting drug users with fentanyl, endanger children online and dodge law enforcement after plundering COVID relief programs.</p><p>Below is the complete list of winning entries from The Times:</p><p><b>Single day photo story </b></p> First Place and Best in Show: Christina House, Hollywoods Finest Second Place: Francine Orr, The Fight Against COVID, a Chaplain Says, Unfolded on Sacred Ground'<p><b>Local news beat coverage or continuing story in top 20 media market</b></p> First Place: Alene Tchekmedyian, The chaotic tenure of L.A.

Kennedy Journalism Award for Domestic Photography for her photographs chronicling the tumultuous journey of a pregnant woman living on the streets of Los Angeles. Additionally, the podcast series The Outlaw Ocean, which was reported by Ian Urbina and the Outlaw Ocean Project and presented by CBC Podcasts and the L.A. Times, was honored with the Nontraditional Media and John Seigenthaler Courage in Journalism Award.</p><p>Founded by the reporters who covered Robert F. Kennedys historic 1968 presidential campaign, the awards honor outstanding reporting on issues that reflect Robert F. Kennedys concerns, including human rights, social justice and the power of individual action in the United States and around the world. The awards were presented in a virtual ceremony on May 3 to coincide with World Press Freedom Day.</p><p>Houses winning photographs were part of the multimedia series <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-07-13/hollywoods-finest-series-pregnancy-homelessness-los-angeles">Hollywoods Finest</a>, in which she, along with Times Reporter Gale Holland and Videographer Claire Hannah Collins, spent more than four years following Mckenzie Trahan as she prepared for the birth of her daughter, transitioned to motherhood and struggled to find and keep a home in which to raise her baby.</p><p>In photographing the story, House captured many exhilarating and gut-wrenching moments with Trahan, accompanying her to an ultrasound appointment, observing joy and happy tears following her daughters birth and witnessing her heartbreak and downward spiral as her daughter was removed from her care.</p><p>House said receiving the award is an absolute honor and noted that it was a great privilege to foster a relationship with Trahan and to tell her story. I was carrying a child when I met Mckenzie, who was nearly seven months into her own pregnancy, she said. We connected as mothers on the same journey but on very different paths.</p><p>My intentions for this project were to highlight the challenges of a young mothers fight to get off the streets and raise her daughter when faced with the stigma of homelessness, drug addiction, mental health and intergenerational trauma, House said. What is revealed is a series of holes in these systems that were built to help our vulnerable populations. I hope Mckenzies story helps open up dialogue on how to better serve families and help keep them together.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times and CBC Podcasts launched <a href="https://www.theoutlawocean.com/the-outlaw-ocean-podcast/" target="_blank">The Outlaw Ocean,</a> a true-crime podcast that exposes criminal activities that take place on the worlds high seas, in September 2022.

The goal:as well as <p>to create space for a cross</p>-<p> section of society to engage with the staff. As our organization's public face</p> to the world<p>, Do will serve as a bridge between our community of readers and the newsroom, helping to deepen our relationship with our audiences.</p> "In a job that bridges our communities and the newsroom, I will give each side the open ear it deserves, finding common ground so they can hear and learn from each other," Do said.<p>Do steps into the role after spending nearly 11 years as a Metro reporter covering Asian American issues and general assignments. Born in Saigon, Do is a graduate of USC with dual degrees in journalism and English. She has worked at the Seattle Times, the Orange County Register and Nguoi Viet Daily News, the largest Vietnamese-language publication in the nation</p> ,<p> launched by her late father. It was there that she learned how to interact with readers while in grade school. As his junior assistant, she took calls from subscribers, bundled papers for delivery and in those pre-cell</p> <p>phone and email days in the early '80s, dealt with messengers, advertisers and story subjects across generations.</p><p>From those experiences, she developed a constant curiosity about how groups and individuals connect or collide and how to </p>elevate  cultivate <p>empathy in your daily pursuits. </p> She has reported from Cuba, India, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam, elevating on-the-ground storytelling in underserved communities with cultural research and interview techniques honed from five years of living&nbsp;in Mexico City.<p>As a reporter, her favorite stories found her on the streets, wading into humanity, running up to strangers. She could be counted on to get all manner of personalities to reveal their innermost thoughts  from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-adv-cabbie-inmate-friendship-20160225-story.html">cabbie</a> kidnapped by jailhouse escapees and the lone&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-03-13/from-a-tiny-desk-newspaper-editor-opens-window-to-chaotic-myanmar">newsman</a>&nbsp;opening up a window to chaotic Myanmar to nail salon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-ff-nail-chat-20130718-dto-htmlstory.html">chatter</a>&nbsp;and those who call themselves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-oc-homeless-couple/">"throwaways,"</a>&nbsp;struggling with homelessness and addiction.&nbsp;Her writing on culture and trauma has won awards from Columbia University and the Asian American Journalists Assn., and she is a recipient of Yales Poynter Fellowship in Journalism.</p><p>Colleagues describe Do as "supremely calm" and "most diplomatic." These qualities will be handy as she navigates being both an advocate for The Times and for readers, hosting events and serving as </p> a<p> liaison on questions of accuracy, fairness and bias. She will work with the legal department, communications department and top editors on crafting the newsrooms responses to sensitive issues and serve as a member of our Standards and Practices Committee and Guidelines Committee. Do also joins me and Deputy Editor for Culture and Talent Joseph Serna to </p>help <p>recruit and hire talent.

In this role, he will focus on features and investigations, as well as cover breaking news. His work will examine the entirety of the culinary ecosystem, from the fields where food is grown to the fine-dining haunts where it is served.</p><p>As a coverage area, food has long been of interest to Miller. During his 10 years at The Times, he has profiled the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-02-21/la-fo-french-laundry-memories">forgotten founder of the French Laundry</a>, uncovered the legal battles of an investment firm that shuttered a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-03-06/curry-house-closure-food-management-partners-vulture-investors">beloved Japanese restaurant chain</a> and written about the deli waitress who became L.A.'s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-04-03/coronavirus-nate-n-als-waitress-gloria-leon">hottest free agent</a> during the early months of the pandemic, among other stories. Earlier this year, he penned a Column One about a Monterey Park restaurateur who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-27/la-me-monterey-park-shooting-red-envelope">grappled with moving on</a> from the mass shooting there and covered a spate of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-03-15/la-unwanted-uber-eats-mcdonalds-starbucks">unwanted Uber Eats deliveries</a> that inundated two L.A. neighborhoods.</p><p>As an enterprise reporter for Business, Miller wrote about a missing, million-dollar pocket watch <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-12-09/la-me-missing-pocket-watch-jp-morgan">once owned by J.P. Morgan</a>, exposed sexual misconduct allegations at L.A.s storied Magic Castle and profiled a controversial classic car dealer with "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" ties. More recently, Miller has helmed The Times' ongoing coverage of last year's <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-10-20/la-brinks-heist-jewelry-whereabouts">Brink's big rig jewelry heist</a>. He was also the host of the 2019 documentary podcast Larger Than Life, which chronicled the life of street racer Big Willie Robinson.</p><p>An L.A. native and UCLA graduate, Miller joined The Times in 2013 and spent five years covering the business of entertainment for Company Town. In that role, he broke stories on sexual abuse allegations in Hollywood, detailed the <a href="https://graphics.latimes.com/finding-marlowe/">noir-soaked life of a Black detective</a> with claimed connections to Raymond Chandler and revealed the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disney-anaheim-deals/">Walt Disney Co.s complex business ties</a> to the city of Anaheim. Miller was a Loeb Awards finalist in 2016 for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-selling-stardom-sg-storygallery.html">Selling Stardom,</a> a series on unscrupulous show business operators.</p><p>For Metro, Miller's rigorous reporting and eye for narrative will illuminate an essential beat: food. As a hub for innovation, creation, exportation  and exploitation  L.A. occupies a singular space in the global culinary establishment. Miller's work will scrutinize the powerful interests in this multifaceted industry. As part of his job, he will communicate regularly with and at times produce stories for our Food section and will report to me. He started April 10.</p>                                    </article>            </body>            </html>]]></content:encoded>
