				How do I get more financial aid?
			</summary>
			<div class="expandable-content">
				<p><b>Review your FAFSA</b></p>
<p>Most student aid is based upon financial need, which is determined by the results of your FAFSA. The first step you should take is to ensure that the information you submitted on your FAFSA is correct. If your initial submission contained errors, you should correct your data on the FAFSA website at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">studentaid.gov</a>. If your original data was correct when first submitted but your financial circumstances have changed since you filed the FAFSA, then, depending upon your situation, you may be eligible for review through a process called Professional Judgment. This process allows a financial aid administrator, under specific circumstances, to review your FAFSA eligibility based on new documentation, which will possibly change your eligibility for federal student aid. To determine if you are eligible, you should contact the Office of Financial Aid and explain the change that occurred. The financial aid administrator will determine if your circumstances can be taken into consideration and will advise you of the next step in the process.</p>
<p><b>Change in Eligibility Increase</b></p>
<p>If you have enrolled for additional credit points and your tuition and/or fees have increased, if your housing status has changed (i.e. &quot;off campus&quot; vs. &quot;on campus&quot;), or if your grade level has changed, then your eligibility for federal loans (and possibly other types of student aid) may be reevaluated. <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/contact-the-financial-aid-team.html">Contact the Office of Financial Aid</a> or send an e-mail message to explain your status change at NYU and to request that your aid be reviewed and/or your federal loan amount be increased if you are deemed eligible. If so, we will certify the additional amount(s) and send you a revised financial aid award notification. (Please note that annual and aggregate maximum borrowing limits apply to the <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/federal-loans.html">Federal Stafford Loan</a>.)</p>
<p>This change may also affect your eligibility for private student loans. Once you have maximized your federal loan eligibility then you may apply for additional private loan amounts to meet the cost of attendance. (See our information about <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/private-loans.html">Private Loans</a>.) Once we have received approval from your lender, the Office of Financial Aid will certify the private loan and then notify you accordingly.</p>
<p><b>Individual Budget Appeal</b></p>
<p>If you find that your miscellaneous education-related expenses for the academic year (e.g. books and supplies, computer equipment, etc.) will exceed those projected in NYU's estimated budget for your total cost of attendance (see <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/tuition-and-other-costs.html">Tuition, Fees, and Expenses</a>), please contact the <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/contact-the-financial-aid-team.html">Office of Financial Aid</a>.</p>
<p><b>General Scholarship Increase Request</b></p>
<p>Returning undergraduate students who have completed one full semester as an undergraduate at NYU already, are enrolled full-time in an NYU undergraduate program, have experienced a change in their financial situation, and are not already the recipient of appeal funds for the semester may <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/managing-your-aid/adjusting-your-aid/scholarship-appeal-for-returning-undergraduates.html">appeal for additional scholarship funding</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a NYU graduate student, you should consult with the admissions/financial aid representative in your school or program department (see <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/contact-the-financial-aid-team/school-contacts.html">School Financial Aid Contacts</a>).</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>Regardless of your status, we strongly encourage all students to explore the many <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/scholarships-and-grants.html">private scholarships</a> available.</p>
<p>You also may find <a href="/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/when-and-how-to-pay/payment-plans-old.html">NYU Payment Plans</a> to be helpful. Although they are not a form of financial aid, NYU Payment Plans provide a good way to budget and plan your payments for each semester.</p>

				My parents don&#39;t support me and won&#39;t contribute to my education, so why am I still considered a &#34;dependent&#34; student?
			</summary>
			<div class="expandable-content">
				<p>It's a federal definition.</p>
<p>There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see <a href="https://studentaid.gov/resources" target="_blank">The Guide to Federal Student Aid</a> for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a &quot;dependency override&quot; with our office. The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.</p>
<p><b>INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY</b></p>
<p>To demonstrate the &quot;involuntary dissolution&quot; of your family you must present:</p>
<ul>
<li>A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:<ul>
<li>who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has represented you in legal proceedings), and;</li>
<li>who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status. (Note that just because a student is considered &quot;independent&quot; does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.)</p>

<p><b>New York and Shanghai: </b>U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and <a href="https://studentaid.gov/help/eligible-noncitizen">eligible non-citizens</a> must file the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> to determine federal financial aid eligibility each year. No application is needed for scholarship renewal. If you are a New York student who received a <a href="https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/apply-for-financial-aid/nys-tap.html">TAP Grant</a>, you should also file a TAP application to determine TAP Grant eligibility. The priority filing date is May 1 each year.</p>
<p><b>Returning Graduate Students</b></p>
<p>All U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens">eligible non-citizens</a> must file the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">FAFSA</a> to determine federal financial aid eligibility. The priority filing date is May 1 each year. Graduate scholarship renewal requirements vary depending on the school. Please check with your school to determine whether the FAFSA is required or if there are any other specific requirements for scholarship renewal.</p>
<p><b>More Information for FAFSA Filers</b></p>
<p>Each year the U.S. Department of Education will send to you a renewal reminder containing important information about your <a href="http://fsaid.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid ID</a> and the FAFSA application process. If you included a valid email address on your FAFSA last year, you will receive the reminder by email. Otherwise it will be mailed to your permanent address. You will need your FSA ID to access your pre-filled FAFSA on the Web application that contains much of your application data from last year.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://fsaid.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FSA website</a> to verify your existing ID, to request a duplicate if you have forgotten it, or to request a new one if you (and your parents, if applicable) don't have one. You use the same ID each year, so you should have one already if you have filed a FAFSA in the past.</p>
<p>It is possible to submit the FAFSA online without a FSA ID, but you must provide answers to all questions on a new FAFSA and you must print, sign, and mail the signature page after you submit the application, which will slow the process.</p>
<p>Beginning October 1, you may access your FAFSA on the <a href="https://studentaid.gov/">FAFSA website</a> and revise the information to reflect your income for the required year (the FAFSA relies on tax data from two years prior to the applicable academic year), correct other information if it has changed, and then submit the application. Be sure that you specify NYU (federal school code 002785) as the recipient of your information.</p>
<p>You should receive your Student Aid Report (SAR) within a few weeks after submitting the FAFSA. Call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243) if you don't receive it. You may also view your SAR on the FAFSA website and make changes if necessary.</p>
<p>If you apply correctly and on time you can expect your NYU financial aid award notification by mid-June (for returning undergraduates), describing your aid package for the next academic year. Returning undergraduate scholarships should renew at the same amount each year as long as you have met the <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/managing-your-aid/renewing-your-aid.html">renewal criteria</a>.</p>
<p>Remember that the FAFSA and all necessary signatures must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU no later than May 1 (not postmarked May 1), or the department deadline specified by your NYU school, if different. If you delay, a loss of aid could result. Remember, you must apply each year to renew your financial aid. May 1 is the priority deadline for most schools at NYU. Applying late could make you ineligible for certain types of aid, and funds become more limited. If you submitted a FAFSA last year and received an NYU scholarship, you should submit the FAFSA again each year by the NYU deadline to ensure normal processing.</p>

Funds will be disbursed to your Bursar account in accordance with federal disbursement schedules. Also, please note that the increase could affect your loan eligibility for the upcoming summer if you plan to attend and receive federal loans in the summer.</p>

				I will enroll in a January Term course. Is financial aid available?
			</summary>
			<div class="expandable-content">
				<p><b>Scholarships - Undergraduate Students</b>: NYU undergraduate students do not need to complete an application for NYU January Term (J-Term) Scholarship. We will review students for a prorated amount of J-Term scholarship based on their Fall/spring scholarship eligibility, enrollment, and demonstrated financial need. Students will be reviewed after they have enrolled in J-Term credits, usually within 7-10 days of registration.</p>
<p>Students who change January term enrollment or who do not attend in January will have their January scholarship adjusted or cancelled.</p>
<p><b>Scholarships - Graduate Students:</b> Graduate student scholarship eligibility for NYU January Term (J-term) is determined by your school and usually does not require an application. A majority of the graduate schools do not offer J-term scholarships.</p>
<p>If you are eligible for a scholarship and change January term enrollment or do not attend in January, your January scholarship will be adjusted or cancelled.</p>
<p><b>Federal Aid</b></p>
<p>Federal financial aid is available for J-term enrollment. Eligibility is based on the combined total of credits between the J-term and the Spring term. For Federal Direct Loans, students must be enrolled at least half time, which is at least 6 credits or have an approved equivalency, between the J-Term and Spring term. For Pell Grants, eligibility is based on a student's FAFSA EFC (Expected Family Contribution from the Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and enrollment as either a full-time or part-time student.</p>
<p>Students will be reviewed for federal financial aid as long as they have a valid FAFSA on file, are enrolled for an appropriate amount of credits, and are otherwise eligible.</p>
<p><b>Private Loans</b></p>
<p>Students needing additional financial aid for January Term will be able to seek out alternative loans. Students seeking alternative loans are encouraged to relay to their potential lender the number of credits they will be taking, as some have minimum enrollment criteria. Private loan eligibility cannot exceed the cost of attendance for January term minus any other aid students may receive for the term. NYU cannot recommend or endorse any particular private lender. Students are encouraged to research their options carefully.</p>
<p><b>Visiting Non-NYU Students</b></p>
<p>If you are a visiting non-NYU student, NYU grants/scholarships are not available to you for the January Term. However, visiting non-NYU students currently receiving federal financial aid at their home school may be able to apply a portion of it to their attendance at NYU by implementing a Consortium Agreement. Please consult with the financial aid office at your home school to determine if you can complete a Consortium Agreement for New York University.</p>
<p>In addition, visiting non-NYU students who are receiving institutional scholarship or grant funds from their home school while attending January Term at NYU must notify New York University.</p>
<p>Visiting non-NYU students may apply for a <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/private-loans.html">private (non-federal) alternative loan</a> for the January Term.</p>
<p>Visiting non-NYU students will receive further information and instructions upon registration for January Term at NYU.</p>

				<p>In order to become eligible for any federal aid, you must be enrolled at least half-time.

Students should be aware that equivalencies do not override a department minimum credit requirement to maintain any institutional aid or scholarship, nor does it qualify students to receive additional financial aid as it is based on actual credit enrollment. Graduate students should contact their academic department to determine eligibility. If eligible, your account will be updated by your department for the Office of Financial Aid to view. Undergraduate students are NOT eligible to apply for an equivalency.</p>

<p>The purpose of the process is to allow the OFA to collect the documents necessary to verify that the information reported on the FAFSA is correct. If any information is incorrect, the OFA must make corrections and submit the corrections to the Department of Education for reprocessing.</p>
<p>You and your family agreed to provide financial information when you completed the FAFSA. Everyone who signs the FAFSA agrees to &quot;If asked, provide information that will verify the accuracy of your completed form.&quot;</p>

<li>Your FAFSA contains estimated information</li>
<li>The data you provided on the FAFSA was inconsistent. Verification is a federal regulation.</li>

				<p>If, according to federal guidelines, you are a dependent student, your parents must submit any and all financial information requested by the Office of Financial Aid, regardless of whether or not they support you or intend to continue supporting you.</p>
<p>There are basic requirements a student must meet to be considered an independent student (see <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/resources">The Guide to Federal Student Aid</a> for criteria). If you do not meet these requirements but you still believe you are truly independent of your parents, you may appeal for a &quot;dependency override&quot; with our office.  The example below describes the conditions of an acceptable override, but if your situation is different please bring it to our attention for review.</p>
<p><b>INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION OF FAMILY</b></p>
<p>To demonstrate the &quot;involuntary dissolution&quot; of your family you must present:</p>
<ul>
<li>A letter written by you which states that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents and also explains what precipitated the dissolution of the family.</li>
<li>A letter from a third party (someone not related to you) stating that you do not and cannot have contact with your parents. The letter must be written by someone:<ul>
<li>who is professional (preferably your social worker or case worker, a member of the clergy, or a lawyer who has been represented you in legal proceedings), and;</li>
<li>who has personal, first-hand knowledge of your familial situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A copy of your completed FAFSA, which must be submitted as if you were an independent student.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can provide the appropriate documentation, a dependency override will be considered for you and your financial aid award may be changed based upon an independent status.  </p>
<p>Please note: just because a student is considered &quot;independent&quot; does not necessarily mean a student's aid will increase.</p>

If you are not sure which of the five centers is your assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government’s <a href="https://nslds.ed.gov/" target="_blank">National Student Loan Data System</a> to determine your servicer. You may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.</p>

				<p>Loan refunds are administered through the <a href="/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/contact-us.html">Office of the Bursar</a>, and there are important elements to consider if you are anticipating a credit balance.  For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days after your disbursement date.</p>

<li>If you are not initially approved for a Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, you will receive an endorser packet directly from the U.S. Department of Education.

Your PLUS Loan cannot disburse to your Bursar bill until you have completed the PLUS Credit Counseling. PLUS Credit Counseling must be completed for each loan that was originally credit denied and have since been approved by appeal or endorser, even if the borrower has completed the counseling for a previous loan.<br />

<li>The U.S. Department of Education does not inform the NYU Office of Financial Aid about the specific reason for the denial of a Federal PLUS Loan.

				<p>You, the student, must start the process by accepting the offered Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan on your Albert account.  You can do so by logging in to Albert and then clicking on the Accept/Decline Financial Aid link and following the instructions.</p>
<p>Your parent borrower will be asked to complete the Federal Direct PLUS Loan Request and Master Promissory Note by visiting the Direct Loan Web site at <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">studentaid.gov</a>. They must sign in using the same <a href="http://fsaid.ed.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid ID</a> that was assigned to them to access your FAFSA. If they do not remember their ID, they may request a duplicate on the <a href="http://fsaid.ed.gov/" target="_blank">FSA website</a>.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Education will conduct a credit check that is valid for only 90 days.  Your parent borrower should not apply more than 90 days before the start of fall semester to avoid credit expiration.</p>
<p>Shortly after the PLUS Loan originates to the Department of Education, an email from the NYU Office of Financial Aid will be sent to the parent borrower (only if the PLUS Loan was credit approved). The approved parent must complete the PLUS Loan process by logging in to the NYU Student System as instructed in this email and by providing the dollar amount of the Parent PLUS Loan that is desired and the parent must actively accept the PLUS Loan on the same page.<br />

				I haven&#39;t yet applied, but my bill is due soon. I know processing takes several weeks from start to finish. Is there any type of interim aid I can have while I wait?
			</summary>
			<div class="expandable-content">
				<p>There is no interim aid.  Students often ask if they can take out private, non-federal loans while they wait for their financial aid application to be processed and their federal loans to be disbursed.  Students are discouraged from pursuing this because it also takes a few weeks to receive alternative loans, and if you take out alternative loans in advance of your federal loans, you may inadvertently take out too much private loan, which you would then have to return.  This can be costly.  Or, if you didn't want to return the private loan funds your federal aid eligibility could be adversely affected.  The best strategy is to <a href="/admissions/financial-aid-and-scholarships/applying-and-planning-for-undergraduate-aid/how-to-apply.html">apply for financial aid</a> as soon as possible, and, in the interim, work out a <a href="/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/when-and-how-to-pay/payment-plans-old.html">payment plan</a> with the Bursar.  If you're eligible for financial aid and you've already made a payment to the Bursar, you will be <a href="/students/student-information-and-resources/bills-payments-and-refunds/refunds-and-withdrawals.html">refunded</a> the amount of overpayment.</p>

For example, because your loans can not be released to NYU before your designated disbursement date, and because once they are disbursed certain basic enrollment criteria must first be verified (e.g. you normally must be enrolled for at least 6 points) before the loan amount is applied to your account balance, a refund resulting from your student loan will usually not be confirmed and processed until a few days <b>after</b> your disbursement date.</p>

			<div class="expandable-content">
				<p>Yes, parent borrowers have the right to cancel all or part of any disbursement of a federal Parent PLUS Loan without being charged interest and other loan fees as long as the cancellation is processed within 120 days of the original disbursement date. The disbursement date is the date the funds were applied to your NYU Bursar bill during any given semester.</p>
<p>To request a cancellation, they must make the request through the NYU Bursar’s Office by completing a Request to Return Loan Funds Form and submitting it to the Bursar as instructed on the form.</p>
<p>If they wish to cancel all or part of any disbursement of their loan more than 120 days after it was disbursed, they are actually repaying part of their loan and they must pay any accrued interest and/or fees. They cannot cancel their loan, but they can make a payment directly to your federal loan servicer.  Borrowers are assigned to one of the five servicers, which include ACS, Great Lakes, NelNet, PHEAA, and Sallie Mae. If they are not sure which of the five centers is their assigned servicer, visit and log into the federal government’s <a href="http://www.nslds.ed.gov">National Student Loan Data System</a> to determine their servicer. They may also call 1-800-4-FED-AID to locate your servicer.<br />
